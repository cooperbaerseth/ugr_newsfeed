On Friday, SAG-AFTRA actors will join members of the Writers Guild of America on the picket lines. It will be the first such double strike in 63 years.\\n\\nFilm and television production, which has already slowed significantly in Los Angeles since the writers\\u2019 strike began in May, will grind to a halt. Tens of thousands of workers will be off the job \\u2014 and not just the union members on strike. Camera operators, set decorators, production assistants and others who work on sets will be affected. So will businesses and their employees who rely on industry spending, including restaurants, hotels and dry cleaners.\\n\\nThe decision by SAG-AFTRA to strike isn\\u2019t a surprise. Nor was the walkout in early May by WGA members. The strikes have been seen as inevitable, given the entertainment industry\\u2019s rapid transition to streaming, which has changed the economics of the business, and the arrival of artificial intelligence that could reduce or replace the need for human talent. All parties \\u2014 actors, writers and the studios \\u2014 view this as an existential moment for the industry, one that could make or break careers.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThat\\u2019s why it\\u2019s time for Los Angeles and California political leaders to step into the fray. Mayor Karen Bass, Gov. Gavin Newsom, U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, among others, can play an important role in publicly and privately nudging studio and union heads back to the negotiating table. The outstanding issues are complex and challenging, particularly when it comes to writing a new playbook for the use of AI. But there cannot be a resolution without committed, well-intentioned negotiations.\\n\\nSince the writers\\u2019 strike began more than two months ago, there have been no discussions between the Writers Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which includes Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Discovery-Warner, NBC Universal and Sony. Tensions rose this week when Deadline quoted an unnamed studio executive who said the alliance intended to drag out the strike to at least October \\u201cuntil union members start losing their apartments and their homes\\u201d and would be willing to drop their demands. The alliance denied that plan.\\n\\nBoth the writers and the actors say this is an inflection point for the industry and they are striking to reverse a decline in their livelihoods since the arrival of streaming. They argue that streaming, compared to traditional broadcasting, has worsened pay and working conditions and made it harder to eke out a middle-class living. SAG-AFTRA leaders were urged by members, including A-list actors , to hold out for a \\u201ctransformative deal.\\u201d\\n\\nMedia companies, according to Times\\u2019 reporting, have argued that most streaming services still aren\\u2019t profitable. The companies have been under pressure from shareholders to cut costs and figure out a business model that works. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said this week that writers and actors are \\u201cnot realistic,\\u201d given the disruptions the industry has gone through and the business environment.\\n\\nWith the rising tension and the gap between the writers and actors and the studios, it looks like the strikes could go on for a while. That\\u2019s deeply concerning for the industry and for its home base in Los Angeles, where film and television is an important economic engine. The mayor, the governor and other state leaders surely understand the impact and ought to push for a fast, fair resolution.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Los Angeles Times\", \"author\": \"Anousha Sakoui\", \"title\": \"Hollywood on strike: Actors' union SAG-AFTRA poised for walkout as industry awaits board vote\", \"description\": \"SAG-AFTRA's national board on Thursday is expected to approve a strike plan after last-ditch negotiations with the major studios failed to yield a new deal.\", \"url\": \"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-07-13/sag-aftra-board-strike-plan-vote\", \"text\": \"SAG-AFTRA\\u2019s national board of directors on Thursday voted unanimously to approve a strike action by tens of thousands of Hollywood actors, widening the scope of labor unrest in an entertainment industry that is already facing numerous headwinds.\\n\\nThe vote came after negotiations between the actors\\u2019 union and the major studios failed to reach an agreement on a new film and TV contract.\\n\\nActors \\u2014 similarly to screenwriters already on picket lines \\u2014 have been battling studios for a pact that would deliver far better pay and residuals from streaming and address other issues, including the use of artificial intelligence, that have been roiling the entertainment landscape.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDespite the last-minute involvement of a federal mediator, the 160,000-member union was unable to secure a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents studios in labor dealings.

The actors also want increases to streaming residuals \\u2014 royalties for when TV shows and films are replayed \\u2014 and for their members to participate in the success of hits. They also want their health and pension plans boosted and desire protections related to the use of artificial intelligence, which has become an increasingly prevalent tool for studios and filmmakers.\\n\\nSAG-AFTRA also pushed for curbs to the practice of self-taped auditions, which actors argue puts undue pressure and costs on performers trying to get work.\\n\\n\\u201cThe AMPTP has remained steadfast in devaluing the work of our members,\\u201d said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA\\u2019s chief negotiator. \\u201cA strike is an instrument of last resort.... Unfortunately, they have left us with no alternative.\\u201d\\n\\nThe AMPTP said it was disappointed, putting the blame on the union. The group said a strike would deepen financial harm for those dependent on the industry, which includes not just writers and actors but also prop warehouses, makeup artists and set designers.\\n\\nAMPTP said the studios offered the union the \\u201chighest percentage increase\\u201d in guild minimums in 35 years, limits to self-taped tryouts and substantial increases in pension and health contribution caps, among other proposals. The group said its offers included a 58% increase in salaries for major role (guest star) performers on high-budget streaming programs and a pay increase of at least 11% in Year 1 for background actors, stand-ins and photo doubles.\\n\\nWalt Disney Co. Chief Executive Bob Iger, in an interview on CNBC, said that the expectations of the writers and actors are \\u201cjust not realistic\\u201d and that their job actions are \\u201cadding to a set of challenges that this business is already facing that is quite frankly very disruptive and dangerous.\\u201d\\n\\nThe union leaders, however, said the AMPTP\\u2019s concessions were insufficient.

Some studio executives are predicting the strikes could stretch into the fall.\\n\\nSuch a bleak scenario appeared unlikely only a few weeks ago after Drescher stood alongside SAG-AFTRA\\u2019s chief negotiator, National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, at the Sherman Oaks headquarters of the AMPTP to deliver her video message to members.\\n\\nOn that Saturday night, Drescher appeared to be painting an overly rosy picture of the negotiations because, at that point, there hadn\\u2019t been any substantial movement by either side on pivotal deal points, according to people close to the negotiations.\\n\\nIn fact, the day before the video was recorded, talks had grown contentious when SAG-AFTRA pressed what it felt was an important demand. The union wanted streaming companies, including Netflix, Disney and Amazon, to share with the performers the revenue generated through subscriptions, the knowledgeable people said.\\n\\nSAG-AFTRA had asked that 2% of the streaming revenue be distributed to performers who appeared in their most successful movies and shows. Because streaming companies have refused to provide precise viewership data with producers and other creatives, SAG-AFTRA suggested using data from a third party, such as Parrot Analytics, to measure the popularity of streaming programs.\\n\\nThat always was a non-starter for streaming companies, which noted Parrot Analytics largely measures social media conversations that gauge interest in a program \\u2014 not actual viewership. And they refused to budge on giving show creators the actual audience numbers.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Drescher was asked about her sanguine tone during the June 24 video.\\n\\nShe said she went into negotiations thinking a deal was within reach, but \\u201cthey weren\\u2019t really ready to get to the core issues,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nThe video triggered an avalanche within SAG-AFTRA. Hundreds of A-listers \\u2014 including Meryl Streep, Amy Schumer, Jennifer Lawrence and John Leguizamo \\u2014 wrote an open letter to the union\\u2019s leadership, applying added pressure. Their message: Do not stop short of anything less than a \\u201ctransformative\\u201d deal.\\n\\n\\u201cWe are concerned by the idea that SAG-AFTRA members may be ready to make sacrifices that leadership is not,\\u201d the letter said. \\u201cThis is an unprecedented inflection point in our industry, and what might be considered a good deal in any other years is simply not enough.\\u201d\\n\\nSAG-AFTRA leaders extended negotiations beyond the original June 30 deadline to July 12. Negotiators on both sides took just one day off from the bargaining \\u2014 July 4.\\n\\nStudio insiders groused about the sheer volume of SAG-AFTRA proposals that needed negotiating. Union leaders put dozens of proposals on the table, according to knowledgeable people. Some complained that SAG-AFTRA filled the negotiation room with more than 30 members of its negotiation team \\u2014 causing delays in meetings and decision-making.\\n\\nDrescher and Crabtree-Ireland disputed the claim that they did not prioritize the demands, saying studio responses were tone-deaf and \\u201cinsulting.\\u201d\\n\\nMany of the union\\u2019s concerns revolved around how profits are shared in Hollywood and union members\\u2019 ability to sustain a living in the profession. The union has argued that outdated contract terms, coupled with shorter seasons and longer hiatuses between seasons make it increasingly hard for many actors to maintain a middle-class lifestyle.\\n\\n\\u201cThe entire business model has been changed by streaming, digital, AI,\\u201d Drescher said. \\u201cYou cannot keep being dwindled and marginalized, and disrespected and dishonored.\\u201d\\n\\nAt the negotiating table, there was little movement, particularly over key issues including wages. SAG-AFTRA had initially demanded basic rate increases of 15% in the first year of the contract \\u2014 triple the amount that Directors Guild of America members accepted in an agreement reached last month with the studios. SAG-AFTRA eventually lowered the raise to 12%. On Wednesday, the guild suggested 11% in the first year.\\n\\nSAG-AFTRA complained that 5% didn\\u2019t keep up with inflation. The studios were not moved.\\n\\n\\u201cI cannot believe it, quite frankly, how far apart we are on so many things,\\u201d Drescher said.\\n\\nMuch of the disagreement centered on residuals, the fees paid out when shows or movies are re-aired after their initial broadcast. With international distribution becoming a dominant form of revenue, SAG-AFTRA hoped to bolster the residual formula and have residuals reflect the success of shows.\\n\\nAnother major sticking point was the use of artificial intelligence, which \\u201chas already proven to be a real and immediate threat to the work of our members and can mimic members\\u2019 voices, likenesses and performances,\\u201d SAG-AFTRA has said.\\n\\nAMPTP offered what it called a groundbreaking proposal that it said \\u201cprotects performers\\u2019 digital likenesses, including a requirement for performer\\u2019s consent for the creation and use of digital replicas or for digital alterations of a performance.\\u201d\\n\\nBut SAG-AFTRA negotiators noted that companies could scan the initial performance of a background actor and then reuse the image without their consent indefinitely.\\n\\n\\u201cThey would \\u2018own\\u2019 you for the rest of eternity,\\u201d said one person close to the SAG-AFTRA negotiating team who was not authorized to comment.\\n\\nAMPTP members said the claim was inaccurate. \\u201cThey would have control and approval rights over their digital replicas,\\u201d according to a studio insider.\\n\\nEarlier this week, studios scrambled to call in a federal mediator to help move talks along. But some \\u2014 even those who are close to the AMPTP \\u2014 questioned why the studios hadn\\u2019t opted for a mediator sooner.\\n\\n\\u201cWe get to the last minute and then all of a sudden they want mediation,\\u201d said a source in the SAG-AFTRA camp.\\n\\nOn Wednesday night, after Drescher and Crabtree-Ireland left empty-handed from their calls with leading executives at Netflix, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery, they returned to the bargaining table with the AMPTP negotiators.\\n\\nWith just minutes remaining in the contract, the actors told the companies they were prepared to negotiate further, Crabtree-Ireland said.\\n\\nCrabtree-Ireland said the AMPTP responded that the companies weren\\u2019t willing to go forward unless the actors would \\u201cact in a civilized manner,\\u201d which riled Crabtree-Ireland, who said Thursday that calling a strike is a core legal right of organized labor.\\n\\nAn AMPTP representative disputed the characterization.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"BBC News\", \"author\": \"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews\", \"title\": \"UK needs culture shift to become AI superpower - DeepMind co-founder\", \"description\": \"Mustafa Suleyman says he has chosen to locate his new AI company in the US.\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66166236\", \"text\": \"\\\"That's the difference between us and them because it's going to take us, you know, four to seven days to train a model and if he's [able to] do it in minutes, then you know, we're never going to catch up,\\\" she said.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Jacobin.com\", \"author\": \"Andy Baio\", \"title\": \"Adam Pickets Everything\", \"description\": \"During the ongoing Hollywood writers\\u2019 strike, comedy writer Adam Conover has been a constant presence on picket lines and on social media, explaining what\\u2019s at stake for strikers and how the union plans to win. We spoke to him about the strike.\", \"url\": \"https://jacobin.com/2023/07/adam-conover-wga-strike\", \"text\": \"Adam Conover didn\\u2019t realize just how precarious a position television writers were in until he was, technically, their boss. It was 2020, and the stand-up comedian had just sold The G Word, his second television show, to Netflix. Conover was a writer and member of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) West union, but he was also one of the show\\u2019s executive producers. One day, as the production staff discussed the writing calendar for the limited series and how many writers they planned to hire, one producer mentioned a benefit that came with partnering with the streaming giant. \\u201cHe says, \\u2018Hey, good news: because we\\u2019re on Netflix, we can do whatever we want with writers: there\\u2019s no minimum compensation and there\\u2019s no minimum term of employment \\u2014 we could hire and fire them by the day if we wanted,\\u2019\\u201d Conover told me. \\u201cHe was talking about how great this was, and other executive producers were like, \\u2018That\\u2019s wonderful for us!\\u2019 But my blood ran cold, because I didn\\u2019t realize how poor writers\\u2019 terms were for the type of comedy I do \\u2014 specifically, it was a comedy/variety show, which has abysmal terms in streaming. We actually have no terms whatsoever, we have no minimums of any sort.\\u201d In its counterproposal to the WGA during negotiations for a new three-year contract, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) wants to permanently lock in that lack of minimums for comedy/variety writers. Under the terms sought by the studios, writing for shows like The G Word would be done on a day rate, turning television writing into a true gig job with zero security, something a comedian does between stand-up sets. For Conover, the conversation was jarring. (He laughs before noting that The G Word\\u2019s most well-known executive producers, Barack and Michelle Obama, were not in the room during the conversation.) He learned a basic reality from the discussion: flexibility for producers meant precarity for writers. Conover hadn\\u2019t yet been a WGA member during the previous strike in 2007, but the comedian knew that it was only because of that work stoppage that streaming services were covered by the union contract work at all. Yet the conversation with his fellow producers made it clear that there was a long way to go. His first television show, Adam Ruins Everything, had aired on truTV, a small channel on basic cable, but the residuals from that project had kept him afloat. There was no such safety net at Netflix. \\u201cGoing back even before the 2007 strike, the only reason residuals exist is because SAG-AFTRA [the Screen Actors Guild\\u2013American Federation of Television and Radio Artists] and the WGA went on strike in 1960, and the same is true of our health and pension plan,\\u201d says Conover. \\u201cBeing in that situation, where I\\u2019m making a show for Barack fucking Obama on the biggest platform in the world and they could pay me $1 a day and hire and fire by the day if they wanted to \\u2014 and not only that, but I\\u2019m asking writers from my old show to join me on the new one with terms that are much worse? All of that made it obvious that right now is our turn to go on strike to win gains for ourselves but also for the writers of the future.\\u201d\\n\\nGetting Involved Conover is one of the most recognizable faces of the current twelve-thousand-member strong WGA strike. He is a negotiating committee member and serves on the WGA West board of directors, and since the strike began on May 2, Conover has been inescapable to anyone following the action. On social media, he posts a constant stream of videos, many of them filmed while walking a picket line, explaining everything: the purpose of the AMPTP, which the WGA is bargaining against (\\u201cto figure out new ways to pay their workers less\\u201d); what a strike captain does (checks strikers in for a shift on the picket line, ensures gates are covered to keep productions shut down); and what the strike is about in the first place (\\u201cthe survival of film and television writing as a sustainable career\\u201d). @adamconover Writers Strike explainer: What is the AMPTP, and what\\u2019s their purpose? #WGAStrong \\u266c original sound \\u2013 Adam Conover On the strike\\u2019s first day, it was Conover who criticized the $250 million salary of Warner Bros.

That wasn\\u2019t a given: during the 2007 strike, the Hollywood labor movement was less unified, and many productions continued rolling. \\u201cWe have the utmost respect for the fact that people are making a sacrifice to make it happen: we have people coming to us saying, \\u2018Put up a picket line, we\\u2019re not going to cross it and we\\u2019re going to help you,\\u2019\\u201d he says. IATSE members nearly struck the AMPTP in 2021, and the union has seen an influx of organizing by the rank and file, particularly younger members, who are fed up with their own unsustainable working conditions. The Teamsters, too, have undergone a change in leadership with the election of Sean O\\u2019Brien. In Los Angeles, Lindsay Dougherty, director of the Teamsters\\u2019 Motion Picture Division and president of Local 399, which represents around 6,500 industry workers, has been a stalwart ally of the WGA during the strike. \\u201cThe AMPTP has declared war on Hollywood labor, and I promise you, it is a war they are going to get,\\u201d said Dougherty at a June 21 WGA rally at the La Brea Tar Pits, near WGA West headquarters. \\u201c[AMPTP president Carol Lombardini] didn\\u2019t plan on our picket lines being joined by workers from every union in town,\\u201d Conover told the crowd in June. \\u201cWe have walked with janitors, with housekeepers, with teachers, with strippers, and that is because we know that we are all in it together and we\\u2019re all fighting the same fight: for a sustainable job in the face of corporate greed.\\u201d @adamconover Honored to speak at the WGA Strong rally last week where THOUSANDS of writers and fellow union members marched in a show of strength and solidarity #WGAStrong \\u266c original sound \\u2013 Adam Conover Watching him speak from the stage, it\\u2019s clear that the process has transformed Conover. He was already comfortable in front of the camera \\u2014 a stand-up comic and SAG-AFTRA member. And he isn\\u2019t new to local politics, having supported Nithya Raman, a Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) member, for Los Angeles City Council in his district. (Conover says that he isn\\u2019t one for \\u201c-isms,\\u201d adding, \\u201cI like to think that I\\u2019m in common cause with DSA, for instance, but I don\\u2019t go to their meetings.\\u201d) But taking on a public role in a nationwide strike is something else entirely. Conover calls it \\u201can area of personal growth.\\u201d \\u201cPeople are looking to me for leadership, and I\\u2019m actually able to deliver it in a way that feels comfortable and that they appreciate,\\u201d he says, but not before noting that that there are many other leaders in the union doing important work behind the scenes: Raphael Bob-Waksberg, for instance, another member of the WGA West board of directors (and the creator of BoJack Horseman), who spends hours a day poring over a spreadsheet to direct other board members to picket lines across Los Angeles; or Ellen Stutzman, the WGA\\u2019s chief negotiator. As for Conover, he\\u2019s busy. The day we spoke, his morning had begun with picketing outside of Netflix at 9:00 a.m. \\u2014 he estimates that he spends around three hours a day picketing. A WGA West board meeting was scheduled after. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very hectic,\\u201d he says. Plus, Conover is currently on a stand-up tour, performing at shows that were booked before the strike began. While his stand-up material isn\\u2019t about the strike, he says that at meet and greets after each stop of the tour, people constantly bring up the strike, wishing him and his fellow writers luck. Being so closely associated with the strike is undoubtedly made easier by the near-universal agreement among writers that this contract marks an inflection point, with the future of their ability to survive in the industry at stake. \\u201cI\\u2019m very cognizant that I\\u2019m playing this role under extremely favorable conditions because the guild is so united,\\u201d says Conover. \\u201cIt would be a lot less comfortable to do it if it was during an action that there was internal dissent about or if the public perception weren\\u2019t so positive. I\\u2019m doing it all with tailwinds.\\u201d The WGA has had moments of internal dissension in its recent past. In 2019, the union took on the Association of Talent Agencies (ATA) over packaging fees and relationships with studios that the writers said amounted to conflicts of interest: writers hired agents to represent them, but their representatives were being paid by the bosses. The campaign, which involved writers firing their agents, proved successful, building the foundation for the union to confidently wage its current strike. But it was originally controversial among the membership. Conover had become a full WGA member in 2016, and he supported the agency campaign. His desire to see it through led him to become more active in the union. Some members of the guild were loudly opposed to the campaign, and the union held hours-long meetings about it in ballrooms at union hotels in Los Angeles. Any member could approach the microphone and argue the case. \\u2018The face-to-face conversation is the atomic unit of politics, and the [union] is nothing but ten thousand face-to-face conversations every day.\\u2019 \\u201cI thought, \\u2018The people on stage are making a good case, but I think I can make an even better one \\u2014if I just sit next to the microphone, I can be one of the first to speak and I can talk to five hundred people in this meeting,\\u2019\\u201d remembers Conover. He went to three meetings across the city, repeating his case to fellow members. \\u201cI was like, \\u2018Oh, this is fucking democracy,\\u2019\\u201d says Conover. \\u201cI started to see the parallels between that and national democracy in a really direct way. The face-to-face conversation is the atomic unit of politics, and the guild is nothing but ten thousand face-to-face conversations every day.\\u201d Not long after the campaign ended in victory, a friend who was a former labor organizer and had written for one of Conover\\u2019s shows nominated him for the WGA West board. Comedy/variety writers, with some of the weakest protections of any television category, were underrepresented in union leadership; Conover felt it was a reason to step up. He asked outgoing WGA West president David A. Goodman for support and received his endorsement. In 2022, Conover was elected to the board. It was less than a year before the contract expired.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Help Net Security\", \"author\": \"Helga Labus\", \"title\": \"US companies commit to safe, transparent AI development\", \"description\": \"Seven US artificial intelligence (AI) giants \\u2013 Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI \\u2013 have publicly committed to \\u201chelp move toward safe, secure, and transparent development of AI technology.\\u201d The commitments \\u201cCompanies that are d\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2023/07/24/us-safe-ai/\", \"text\": \"Seven US artificial intelligence (AI) giants \\u2013 Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI \\u2013 have publicly committed to \\u201chelp move toward safe, secure, and transparent development of AI technology.\\u201d\\n\\nThe commitments\\n\\n\\u201cCompanies that are developing these emerging technologies have a responsibility to ensure their products are safe.

This results in users of these LLMs believing they have intimate knowledge of a subject area even on occasions where they\\u2019ve been misled. Users of LLMs need to approach the results of their prompting with a large dose of scepticism and additional validation from an alternative source. Government guidance to users should emphasise this until the results are more reliable.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe \\u2018testing\\u2019 referred to in the release is likely around both the internal security of AI developers and the broader societal impact of the technologies themselves,\\u201d he added.\\n\\n\\u201cThere is a lot of potential for privacy issues arising from the use of AI technologies, especially around Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. OpenAI themselves disclosed a vulnerability in ChatGPT that inadvertently provided access to other users\\u2019 conversation titles.

As SAG-AFTRA members, we\\u2019ve been impressed over the last few months by how our leadership outlined the unique stakes of the negotiations and the need for a realignment in our industry. We were glad to see SAG-AFTRA lead the way among the guilds in identifying AI as a threat to our livelihoods that must be addressed right now, a \\u201cgame changer.\\u201d We felt as though you understood how wildly our pay and our residuals have been undermined, how long we\\u2019re being held between seasons.

This is an unprecedented inflection point in our industry, and what might be considered a good deal in any other years is simply not enough. We feel that our wages, our craft, our creative freedom, and the power of our union have all been undermined in the last decade. We need to reverse those trajectories. With inflation and continued growth in streaming, we need a seismic realignment of our minimum pay and new media residuals, our exclusivity carveouts, and other terms. We also think it\\u2019s absolutely vital that the deal restore dignity to the casting process by regulating how self-tapes are used. This is an enormous problem for working class actors. And especially as regards Artificial Intelligence, we do not believe that SAG-AFTRA members can afford to make halfway gains in anticipation of that more will be coming in three years, and we think it is absolutely vital that this negotiation protects not just our likenesses, but makes sure we are well compensated when any of our work is used to train AI. We want you to know that we would rather go on strike than compromise on these fundamental points, and we believe that, if we settle for a less than transformative deal, the future of our union and our craft will be undermined, and SAG-AFTRA will enter the next negotiation with drastically reduced leverage.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"AdExchanger\", \"author\": \"Anthony Vargas\", \"title\": \"WaPo\\u2019s New Ads Chief Says AI Can Bring Brands And The News Back Together\", \"description\": \"The Washington Post is looking to capitalize on a resurgence in advertiser interest in news content, and the AI trend, to create new opportunities for brand collaborations.\\nThe post WaPo\\u2019s New Ads Chief Says AI Can Bring Brands And The News Back Together appe\\u2026\", \"url\": \"http://www.adexchanger.com/the-sell-sider/wapos-new-ads-chief-says-ai-can-bring-brands-and-the-news-back-together/\", \"text\": \"The Washington Post is at an inflection point.\\n\\nIt saw a surge in traffic from news-hungry audiences during the Trump administration and COVID-19 pandemic.

We were in the heady days of the Internet bubble, with the dot-com crash still a year away, and the founders of this new company had identified an inflection point in the development of technology.\\n\\nSean Parker and Shawn Fanning hit upon the moment where network speeds and costs dropped so low that high-quality music files could easily be shared between ordinary users, effectively lowering the cost of distribution for this medium to zero. Their application, Napster, provided an easy way for users to take advantage of this, and the response was instant \\u2013 within months it had tens of millions of users, an immense number in an era when Internet access was still far from universal.\\n\\nEnormous amounts of music were transferred over the service, and as well as providing a full catalogue of contemporary popular music, the application became beloved of enthusiasts because it opened up access to music by niche artists, difficult to find albums, and even bootlegs and unreleased tracks.\\n\\nNapster changed the world of music distribution forever. It pointed a flashing neon finger at a technical reality that many executives in that business would have preferred to ignore \\u2013 that digital distribution had become entirely inevitable \\u2013 and paved the way first to digital storefronts and ultimately to the streaming services that now dominate that sector. There was just one problem; Napster didn\\u2019t have permission from musicians or publishers to distribute their work.\\n\\nA new technological frontier and the Wild West atmosphere that springs up around it is exciting and innovative, sure \\u2013 but it\\u2019s also dangerous\\n\\nThe whole enterprise was built on stolen content. The company itself didn\\u2019t send or receive any of that content, but the software it had created was explicitly designed to allow users to do so. When the US courts ordered Napster to start restricting access to infringing material upon being notified of its location, the gig was up; the service was shut down by summer of 2001.\\n\\nIn retrospect, it feels absolutely wild that Napster was an actual start-up company \\u2013 a legal entity, with its creators publicly listed as founders and officers of the company. This was a company with commercial ambitions, whose sole product was a piece of software explicitly designed to be the most efficient way possible to pirate music. It wasn\\u2019t even the only one!\\n\\nFrom AudioGalazy to LimeWire via the likes of Kazaa, there were a bunch of companies built around applications, networks, and protocols that were explicitly designed for music piracy. Networks had reached a point where music distribution was possible, even easy. This technological advancement opened up a whole new landscape, and for a few years in the late 1990s and early 2000s, that landscape was the Wild West.\\n\\nSome people believed that it would stay that way \\u2013 that the advent of zero-cost distribution changed things so fundamentally that old business models would collapse, and music recordings would effectively be forced to become public domain, validating the whole approach taken by companies like Napster.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve been thinking and reading a lot about that era lately, because while history may not repeat itself, it does certainly rhyme \\u2013 and we\\u2019re living through a very similar moment right now. Just as network speeds and capacities inched their way towards the tipping point where they were capable of collapsing the distribution cost of music, so too has progress with generative and predictive machine learning models inched its way painstakingly over the past decade or two until the point where the models\\u2019 capabilities hit an inflection point, enabling technical marvels like MidJourney and ChatGPT to exist.\\n\\nIn retrospect, it feels absolutely wild that Napster was an actual start-up company \\u2013 a legal entity, with its creators publicly listed as founders and officers of the company\\n\\nJust as network capacities created some cultural and commercial inevitabilities that are only really apparent with hindsight, it is probable that generative AI will change a number of industries in very fundamental ways \\u2013 which will seem to have been entirely inevitable all along when we look back upon this era in ten years' time.\\n\\nThe most striking similarity, however, is that we are absolutely in the Wild West era of generative AI. Consequently, we are surrounded by a mix of chancers, outlaws, fast-and-loose entrepreneurs, and wild-eyed philosophising about how This Changes Everything so none of the old rules ought to apply any more.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a mix that anyone from the Napster era would find very familiar \\u2013 and one of the most familiar aspects is that these people aren\\u2019t anarchistic characters releasing software and posting screeds from behind a screen of anonymity, hidden from legal consequence. They\\u2019re wearing suits and sitting in boardrooms. They\\u2019re being interviewed in newspapers and on TV. They\\u2019re giving TED talks.\\n\\nGenerative AI is a major business push, with billions of dollars behind it and names like Microsoft and Adobe fully committed \\u2013 none of which changes for a single second the fact that almost all of these models, and certainly all of the major, popular ones, are built on a mountain of stolen content, all supported by the most flimsy of legal justifications.\\n\\nA new technological frontier and the Wild West atmosphere that springs up around it is exciting and innovative, sure \\u2013 but it\\u2019s also dangerous. Most of the companies that sprang up to take advantage of the new frontier in media distribution around the turn of the millennium were bankrupt or sold for a pittance within a couple of years, after the legal system caught up and confirmed that yes, new technological frontier or not, you\\u2019re still not allowed to run a business whose objective is to make it easier to steal stuff.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not saying that\\u2019s the fate that awaits OpenAI or MidJourney (although, to be clear, I\\u2019m not not saying that either), but some people in this space are going to get burned.\\n\\nThat includes companies in the games industry, where getting out in front of their skates on the topic of generative AI is becoming quite a hobby for some people.\\n\\nGenerative AI is a major business push, with names like Microsoft and Adobe fully committed \\u2013 none of which changes the fact that almost all of these models are built on a mountain of stolen content\\n\\nValve is determined not to be one of those who get burned. The company has hardened up the line it\\u2019s taking on AI-generated content in games on Steam \\u2013 it won\\u2019t approve games which include it. The company says this isn\\u2019t an opinionated stance, merely a reflection of legal realities \\u2013 and it\\u2019s entirely correct in saying so.\\n\\nThere are many jurisdictions in which the legal status of AI models and of the content they create remains unclear; and there are quite a few in which the status is pretty clear, merely obfuscated by a cloud of wishful thinking from AI enthusiasts. Large AI models are trained on huge amounts of copyrighted data, usually without permission of the copyright holder, and sometimes despite the explicit denial of that permission.\\n\\nProponents claim that this is no different to an artist walking around a museum and looking at paintings before going home to paint his own work. In reality, it\\u2019s been repeatedly demonstrated that most if not all AI models can be persuaded through careful prompting to yield almost exact copies of parts of their training data.\\n\\nEven if you\\u2019ve obfuscated content by storing it as interconnected weights across layers of digital neurons, you\\u2019ve still stored it, not merely learned from it as a human would \\u2013 and in most cases, the operators of these models don\\u2019t have the right either to do that, or to use it as a basis for digital remixing, which is essentially what AI models do.\\n\\nNew technological frontier or not, you\\u2019re still not allowed to run a business whose objective is to make it easier to steal stuff\\n\\nDepending how courts and legislatures in various places choose to interpret that (and I do not for a single second envy the task of the lawyers and experts who are going to have to try to explain these systems to bemused judges and lawmakers), this will mean that either the models themselves are judged to breach copyright, or that works created with those models are judged to breach copyright, or both.\\n\\nMaking bets on how rulings and ultimately legislation in major jurisdictions will go on this topic is a fraught business. I\\u2019d argue that it\\u2019s more likely that the models get in trouble than the works created by them, except where a specifically identifiable breach is shown in the case of a piece of text, image, or audio content \\u2013 but a kind of \\\"guilt by association\\\" assumption where every product of a copyright-breaching model is considered to also be in breach is certainly not impossible.\\n\\nFor Valve, and any other distributor, that creates an intolerable risk. They could be found to have sold and distributed copyright-infringing materials, and given the widespread public debates about this aspect of AI, claiming to have been unaware of this possibility may not serve as a defence.\\n\\nWithout very clear guidelines and case law on this matter in most jurisdictions, distributors have little choice but to reject games with AI-generated content. The moral questions around AI are incredibly important, but irrelevant to this specific issue; the question that\\u2019s relevant is the extent to which the distributors have to cover their asses.\\n\\nThat Valve won\\u2019t touch these games should be a wake-up call for everyone in the industry who\\u2019s been starry-eyed about the potential for AI to reduce their costs and speed up their development processes \\u2013 going too far down that path without absolute legal clarity risks disaster.\\n\\nLook, I\\u2019m far from an AI refusenik or luddite! I\\u2019ve written here in the past about how exciting the potential of technologies like LLMs is for games, and I use systems like ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot every day. Wearing my other hat as a university professor, I\\u2019m even in the minority of people in my field who encourage students to use ChatGPT as a tool to assist their work. However, the idea that it\\u2019s going to be possible to build whole swathes of game content through simple text prompting, rather than needing humans to draw, write, compose, and perform that content, is naive at best and incredibly dangerous at worst.\\n\\nThat Valve won\\u2019t touch these games should be a wake-up call for everyone in the industry who\\u2019s been starry-eyed about the potential for AI to reduce their costs and speed up their development processes\\n\\nCreating content from scratch with a generalised AI \\u2013 whether it\\u2019s images, text, voiceover audio, or anything else \\u2013 is something that no game company should ever be doing. The resulting content is a copyright minefield, with the worst case scenarios involving a developer being found to have illegally included copyrighted material in their game, or to have developed the game using copyrighted material illegally built into a key tool.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s worth asking whether any of the vendors such as Unity which are currently enthusiastically adding generative AI features to their tools are willing to indemnify developers against any legal liability arising from the use of those tools. Perhaps some are \\u2013 I\\u2019m not sure if that\\u2019s brave or foolhardy \\u2013 but for the most part, it\\u2019s caveat emptor, and there are some insanely big caveats here.\\n\\nHonestly, even if it\\u2019s decided that this content isn\\u2019t infringing other people\\u2019s copyright, the best case scenario may well be that nobody gets to own the copyright over the resulting content, because it's not deemed to have had sufficient human involvement in its creation. This would result in game assets ending up in the public domain, with the developer losing control over how they are used by others.\\n\\nGenerative AI is going to revolutionise many fields, and game development is probably going to be one of them \\u2013 but not like this. It\\u2019s going to be hell of a lot harder than opening a window to a fantastical piece of software that can replace artists, writers, voice actors and musicians and just telling the magic mirror on the wall what you want it to make for you.\\n\\nGenerative AI is going to revolutionise many fields, and game development is probably going to be one of them \\u2013 but not like this\\n\\nAI systems can be trained on your own content, allowing the streamlining of pipelines for these processes \\u2013 letting your artists remix their own artwork, or allowing your writers to use their scripts to train LLM-driven characters that react dynamically to players. These things are harder, requiring you to have a lot of your own content to start with, and to have the expertise to train and operate an AI system on that content, but this seems like a much more likely model for how development pipelines will ultimately integrate these tools.\\n\\nYet even this isn\\u2019t really possible right now \\u2013 it\\u2019s technically possible, sure, but such systems still rely on a large-scale AI model as their foundation, and the legal status of those underlying models remains incredibly uncertain.\\n\\nUntil such time as there are models out there which are fully in the clear legally \\u2013 either trained entirely on authorised material with a full paper trail, or covered by a new legal framework which permits and controls their use of a wider range of copyrighted material \\u2013 companies should be treating AI as a \\\"look, but don\\u2019t touch\\\" technology.\\n\\nProgress often puts technological reality out in front of legal and commercial frameworks, and the Wild West that results is exciting and innovative, but also controversial and dangerous \\u2013 and like the Wild West we see in games and movies, very much full of outlaws, snake oil salesmen, and a million ways for the unwary and incautious to meet a sticky end. Ultimately, no market of this size and scale will remain the Wild West for long.\\n\\nCourts and legislatures will drive their railroads through and tame the lands \\u2013 and some of the outlaws will get rounded up along the way. In the anarchy of these moments, you should always be asking whether something is too good to be true. A business built on letting people freely share other people\\u2019s intellectual property was always too good to be true.

As SAG-AFTRA members, we\\u2019ve been impressed over the last few months by how our leadership outlined the unique stakes of the negotiations and the need for a realignment in our industry. We were glad to see SAG-AFTRA lead the way among the guilds in identifying AI as a threat to our livelihoods that must be addressed right now, a \\u201cgame changer.\\u201d We felt as though you understood how wildly our pay and our residuals have been undermined, how long we\\u2019re being held between seasons. We\\u2019ve been filled with pride watching the union come together and deliver such an incredibly strong strike authorization vote.\\n\\nBut solidarity demands honesty, and we need to make clear our resolve. A strike brings incredible hardships to so many, and no one wants it. But we are prepared to strike if it comes to that. And we are concerned by the idea that SAG-AFTRA members may be ready to make sacrifices that leadership is not. We hope you\\u2019ve heard the message from us. This is an unprecedented inflection point in our industry, and what might be considered a good deal in any other years is simply not enough. We feel that our wages, our craft, our creative freedom, and the power of our union have all been undermined in the last decade. We need to reverse those trajectories. With inflation and continued growth in streaming, we need a seismic realignment of our minimum pay and new media residuals, our exclusivity carveouts, and other terms. We also think it\\u2019s absolutely vital that the deal restore dignity to the casting process by regulating how self-tapes are used. This is an enormous problem for working class actors. And especially as regards Artificial Intelligence, we do not believe that SAG-AFTRA members can afford to make halfway gains in anticipation of that more will be coming in three years, and we think it is absolutely vital that this negotiation protects not just our likenesses, but makes sure we are well compensated when any of our work is used to train AI. We want you to know that we would rather go on strike than compromise on these fundamental points, and we believe that, if we settle for a less than transformative deal, the future of our union and our craft will be undermined, and SAG-AFTRA will enter the next negotiation with drastically reduced leverage.\\n\\nThis is not a moment to meet in the middle, and it\\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that the eyes of history are on all of us. We ask that you push for all the change we need and protections we deserve and make history doing it. If you are not able to get all the way there, we ask that you use the power given to you by us, the membership, and join the WGA on the picket lines. For our union and its future, this is our moment. We hope that, on our behalf, you will meet that moment and not miss it.\\n\\nCheck out the list of signers below, via Rolling Stone\\u2026\\n\\nChris Abbott\\n\\nAmy Acker\\n\\nPatrick J Adams\\n\\nLauren Adams\\n\\nPaul Adelstein\\n\\nUzo Aduba\\n\\nAlex Anfanger\\n\\nGenevieve Angelson\\n\\nAmy Aniobi\\n\\nHale Appleman\\n\\nAmanda Arcuri\\n\\nFred Armisen\\n\\nKevin Bacon\\n\\nJodi Balfour\\n\\nTalia Balsam\\n\\nElizabeth Banks\\n\\nMatt Barats\\n\\nSara Bareilles\\n\\nIke Barinholtz\\n\\nBritt Baron\\n\\nShakira Barrera\\n\\nMax Barsness\\n\\nTodd Bartels\\n\\nSarah Beth Bassak\\n\\nMikie Beatty\\n\\nAlison Becker\\n\\nEmma Bell\\n\\nTroian Bellisario\\n\\nGregg Bello\\n\\nFrancis Benhamou\\n\\nTodd Berger\\n\\nReed Birney\\n\\nGus Birney\\n\\nEphraim Birney\\n\\nBre Blair\\n\\nDaniel Blake\\n\\nRowan Blanchard\\n\\nRachel Bloom\\n\\nJosh Bonzie\\n\\nMegan Boone\\n\\nJoel Kim Booster\\n\\nJohn Ross Bowie\\n\\nJosh Bowman\\n\\nMac Brandt\\n\\nKurt Braunholer\\n\\nJanicza Bravo\\n\\nKevin Brennan\\n\\nJordana Brewster\\n\\nAlison Brie\\n\\nConnie Britton\\n\\nJacqueline Brogan\\n\\nAmanda Brooks\\n\\nSophina Brown\\n\\nQuinta Brunson\\n\\nAynsley Bubbico\\n\\nRebecca Rose Bulnes\\n\\nJoe Burch\\n\\nOwen Burke\\n\\nDavid Burtka\\n\\nMatt Bush\\n\\nRiver Butcher\\n\\nMichelle Buteau\\n\\nMegan Byrne\\n\\nJ Smith Cameron\\n\\nNeve Campbell\\n\\nJames Carpinello\\n\\nKeith Carradine\\n\\nSam Carson\\n\\nRafael Casal\\n\\nGerardo Celasco\\n\\nWyatt Cenac\\n\\nChris Chalk\\n\\nZoe Chao\\n\\nFrances Chewning\\n\\nJamie Chung\\n\\nJessica St Clair\\n\\nAdelaide Clemens\\n\\nGlenn Close\\n\\nJeremy Cohenour\\n\\nLauren Cook\\n\\nOlivia Cooke\\n\\nSarah Cooper\\n\\nNesta Cooper\\n\\nRob Corddry\\n\\nMaddie Corman\\n\\nTom Costello\\n\\nJulie Craig\\n\\nMichael Cram\\n\\nDavid Cross\\n\\nAshleigh Cummings\\n\\nErin Cummings\\n\\nTim Daly\\n\\nSam Daly\\n\\nAlexandra Daniels\\n\\nBrianne Davis\\n\\nAriana DeBose\\n\\nBrooklyn Decker\\n\\nKathy Deitch\\n\\nMajandra Delfino\\n\\nDavid DeSantos\\n\\nTorrey DeVitto\\n\\nRosemarie DeWitt\\n\\nChris Diamantopoulos\\n\\nDaveed Diggs\\n\\nMaria Dizzia\\n\\nKether Donohue\\n\\nChad Doreck\\n\\nFiona Dourif\\n\\nPaul W.

On both coasts, though, there was a buoyant mood in the air as picket lines were reinvigorated by the support of some of the 65,000 actors who comprise SAG-AFTRA (98% of members voted to approve a strike back in June). This is Hollywood\\u2019s biggest labor fight in six decades, and the first dual strike since 1960, reigniting the fervor against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers just as a historic heat wave hits Southern California.\\n\\nOutside the Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, California, throngs of protesters chanted: \\u201cFists up, curtains down, LA is a union town.\\u201d Food trucks flanking organizers\\u2019 tents served churros, boba tea and cold lemonade to protesters baking in the midday heat that reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit (36.7 Celsius).\\n\\nBut the oppressive sun didn\\u2019t dampen the mood.

Sag-Aftra has around 160,000 members: actors in film and TV shows, as well as video game performers, radio presenters, models and YouTube influencers. Technically the union only covers the US, but its Global Rule One demands that members pull out of any production anywhere in the world.\\n\\nWho is Sag-Aftra\\u2019s firebrand leader?\\n\\nThe union\\u2019s president and figurehead is Fran Drescher, who you might remember from 90s TV show The Nanny. Having faced down a modicum of criticism for shooting off to Italy for a photoshoot with Kim Kardashian as negotiations were heading for the rocks, Drescher stormed back with an incendiary speech, in which she poured scorn on studio bosses (\\u201cThey plead poverty, that they\\u2019re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting. Shame on them.\\u201d) and invoked the spirit of the French Revolution: \\u201cEventually, the people break down the gates of Versailles, and then it\\u2019s over!\\u201d\\n\\n02:28 Fran Drescher delivers fiery speech against Hollywood studios as actors strike \\u2013 video\\n\\nWho are the major supporting players?\\n\\nA preview of the A-listers putting their star-wattage behind the strike came a fortnight ago when a Sag-Aftra letter expressing willingness to strike was signed by the likes of Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Charlize Theron, Joaquin Phoenix, Jamie Lee Curtis, Olivia Wilde and Ewan McGregor. On Friday, George Clooney added his weight to the strike, calling it \\u201can inflection point in our industry\\u201d, and saying that change was required for \\u201cour industry to survive\\u201d. Other big hitters to lend their support over the past 24 hours include John Cusack and Mark Ruffalo. There have been no holdouts \\u2013 all US actors appear to be on board with the action.\\n\\nWhat does Sag-Aftra want? And why can\\u2019t they get it?\\n\\nOne of the union\\u2019s main roles is to negotiate terms with the studios: the last major agreement was signed in July 2020 though it was almost immediately undermined by Covid. That agreement was due to expire on 30 June, hence the start of negotiations. One of the main sticking points appears to be residuals, the payments that performers receive for repeat showings of films or TV shows, while the issue of who owns an actor\\u2019s likeness if it is reproduced by AI is also a major flashpoint. Sag-Aftra negotiators are demanding residuals partly based on viewership levels on streaming services but the studios \\u2013 which include streamers Netflix and Amazon alongside Disney \\u2013 aren\\u2019t willing to share the information.\\n\\nA Writers Guide America placard \\u2026 AI has also been an issue in their dispute. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\\n\\nHas streaming changed everything?\\n\\nStreaming hasn\\u2019t just killed the mid-budget movie, or the linear TV series, it\\u2019s also changed the way films and shows are presented to their audience, and extract money from them in return. Streamers make money from subscribers, and the shows and films are essentially promos for the subscriptions. Plus they are just up there permanently, with no \\u201crepeats\\u201d as we would understand them \\u2013 classic \\u201cdisruption\\u201d, which makes it hard for traditional means of assessing their value in terms of paying people for them. Hence the argument over residuals, made all the harder by the streamers\\u2019 reluctance to reveal how many people watch them. As shows and films on streaming platforms become ever larger and more widely watched, then the potential residuals become an ever more significant amount.\\n\\nWhat about AI?\\n\\nSix months ago, no one gave AI a second thought, but that\\u2019s how fast things have moved: from zero to an existential threat. Right now, AI-generated imagery doesn\\u2019t seem quite sophisticated enough to replace traditional film-making wholesale, but the speed of machine-learning has got everyone worried. The AMPTP said it had offered a \\u201cgroundbreaking\\u201d proposal over AI, but Sag-Aftra\\u2019s chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland batted that one away: \\u201cThey proposed that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get one day\\u2019s pay, and their companies should own that scan, their image, their likeness and should be able to use it for the rest of eternity on any project they want, with no consent and no compensation. So if you think that\\u2019s a groundbreaking proposal, I suggest you think again.\\u201d\\n\\nI thought actors were rich, though?\\n\\nActing is a bit like the sports world: there\\u2019s a bunch of big-money headliners, and then the rest, some of whom earn decent money, but most are on nothing like it. These are the people on whose behalf Tom Cruise went ballistic during the Mission: Impossible shoot: \\u201cYou can tell it to the people that are losing their fucking homes because our industry is shut down! It\\u2019s not going to put food on their table or pay for their college education!\\u201d Matt Damon reminded reporters of the struggles of most US working actors\\u2019 lives: \\u201cIt\\u2019s $26,000 to qualify for health coverage and a lot of people are on the margins and residual payments are getting them across that threshold. This isn\\u2019t an academic exercise. This is real life-and-death stuff.\\u201d\\n\\nMatt Damon with Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh at Thursday\\u2019s Oppenheimer premiere. Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images\\n\\nWill they get what they want? How strong are the unions?\\n\\nThe US might be the home of the labour-dispute massacre (about 1,100 deaths since 1850, by Wikipedia\\u2019s count) but Sag-Aftra is likely to pack a powerful punch. For one thing, its leading members are much more visible than those of the writers\\u2019 union, the WGA, whose strike began in May. And the disappearance of actors means shooting, the most cash-intensive part of the production process, has to stop immediately. But the knock-on effects of the strike aren\\u2019t apparent instantly \\u2013 this isn\\u2019t like refuse or power workers. Both sides are playing a long game: the actors and writers gambling that the product pipeline \\u2013 already threadbare after Covid \\u2013 will force the studios back to the table, while the bosses are taking the time-honoured route of trying to batter the unions into submission.\\n\\nWhat will this mean for the UK?\\n\\nEquity, the UK actors\\u2019 union, has said it will \\u201cstand in unwavering solidarity\\u201d with Sag-Atfra, meaning any of its members who hold joint cards will be loth to work if in doubt, and those who don\\u2019t will feel uncomfortable if there\\u2019s any sense they are taking work from striking colleagues. Beyond that, many productions on these shores are to a greater or lesser extent co-productions. The UK\\u2019s biggest studios host major US productions, all of which are now on hold. These include Deadpool 3, which has been filming at Pinewood, Tim Burton\\u2019s Beetlejuice sequel, Idris Elba thriller Heads of State and the film version of Wicked. TV shows in production and now under threat are second seasons of Andor and The Sandman, and Eddie Redmayne\\u2019s The Day of the Jackal.\\n\\n02:05 Hollywood actors walk out of Oppenheimer premiere as strike action starts \\u2013 video report\\n\\nWhat are the other immediate effects?\\n\\nAs well as halting most shoots, the small print of Sag-Aftra\\u2019s terms means actors will no longer be able to promote shows and films they have already made. Hence the moving forward by an hour of the start time of Oppenheimer\\u2019s London premiere, so its cast could walk the red carpet before the 8pm deadline. The promotional ban extends to social media, with stars now muzzled about their forthcoming work. It also means chatshows will be strikingly light on actors for the foreseeable and any print or radio interviews scheduled to happen from Friday onwards have been cancelled.\\n\\nBradley Cooper and Lady Gaga at the 2018 Venice film festival. A return visit will be tricky this year. Photograph: Franco Origlia/GC Images\\n\\nWhat about in the next few months?\\n\\nThe most pressing effect is likely to be on the autumn festivals \\u2013 Venice, Telluride and Toronto \\u2013 which start at the end of next month. All three are heavily reliant on star wattage to launch movies hoping for major Oscar action. Yet without A-listers to promote them \\u2013 making splashy canal entrances, dolled up on the red carpet and talking to reporters \\u2013 much of the draw of such events will be removed. Venice will need to decide whether it can continue with opening night movie Challengers, for instance, if in-person coverage has to exclusively focus on director Luca Guadagnino rather than stars Zendaya and Josh O\\u2019Connor. Other films not officially announced for the autumn festivals will rapidly need to recalibrate their strategies. Michael Mann\\u2019s Ferrari film could still screen, but without star Adam Driver. When key roles are combined, the situation is potentially more thorny. Bradley Cooper has written, produced, directed and stars in Leonard Bernstein biopic, Maestro. He could promote the film in his producing and directing capacities but would have to refuse any questions about his script or performance.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Independent\", \"author\": \"Matt O'Brien and Zeke Miller\", \"title\": \"Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and other tech firms agree to AI safeguards set by the White House\", \"description\": \"President Joe Biden is praising new commitments by Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and other companies that are leading the development of artificial intelligence technology to meet a set of AI safeguards brokered by his White House as an important step towar\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/joe-biden-ap-amazon-white-house-google-b2379839.html\", \"text\": \"Sign up for the daily Inside Washington email for exclusive US coverage and analysis sent to your inbox Get our free Inside Washington email Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The tests are meant to protect against \\u201csignificant sources of AI risks,\\u201d including biosecurity and cybersecurity risks as well as \\u201cbroader societal effects\\u201d.\\n\\nEach of the companies has also agreed to invest in security safeguards to protect \\u201cmodel weights\\u201d that are proprietary or unreleased, as well as to develop \\u201crobust technical mechanisms\\u201d to \\u201creduce the dangers of fraud and deception\\u201d by permitting AI-generated content to be easily identified through technical means such as watermarking.\\n\\nMr Biden also said the companies\\u2019 investment in trustworthy AI technology will include empowering users to detect altered or fake content, as well as \\u201crooting out bias and discrimination, strengthening privacy protections and shielding children from harm\\u201d.\\n\\n\\u201cThese commitments are real and they're concrete. They're going to help fulfill industry fulfill this fundamental obligation to Americans to develop safe, secure and trustworthy technologies that benefit society and uphold our values,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe president said the rise of AI has been an \\u201castounding revelation\\u201d for him, and predicted that Americans would see more technological change in the next decade than in the previous five, and praised the executives as having \\u201ccritical\\u201d roles in \\u201cshepherding that innovation with responsibility and safety ... to earn the trust of Americans\\u201d.\\n\\n\\u201cSocial media has shown us the harm that powerful technology can do without the right safeguards in place ... we must be clear-eyed and vigilant about the threats emerging from emerging technologies that can pose don't have to but can pose to our democracy and our values.

Scott Pelley dives into the world of AI with Google CEO Sundar Pichai\", \"url\": \"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-artificial-intelligence-future-60-minutes-transcript-2023-07-09/\", \"text\": \"We may look on our time as the moment civilization was transformed as it was by fire, agriculture and electricity. In 2023, we learned that a machine taught itself how to speak to humans like a peer. which is to say, with creativity, truth, errors and lies. The technology, known as a chatbot, is only one of the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence -- machines that can teach themselves superhuman skills. In April, we explored what's coming next at Google, a leader in this new world. CEO Sundar Pichai told us AI will be as good or as evil as human nature allows. The revolution, he says, is coming faster than you know.\\n\\nScott Pelley: Do you think society is prepared for what's coming?\\n\\nSundar Pichai: You know, there are two ways I think about it. On one hand I feel, no, because you know, the pace at which we can think and adapt as societal institutions, compared to the pace at which the technology's evolving, there seems to be a mismatch. On the other hand, compared to any other technology, I've seen more people worried about it earlier in its life cycle. So I feel optimistic. The number of people, you know, who have started worrying about the implications, and hence the conversations are starting in a serious way as well.\\n\\nScott Pelley with Google CEO Sundar Pichai 60 Minutes\\n\\nOur conversations with 50-year-old Sundar Pichai started at Google's new campus in Mountain View, California. It runs on 40% solar power and collects more water than it uses -- high-tech that Pichai couldn't have imagined growing up in India with no telephone at home.\\n\\nSundar Pichai: We were on a waiting list to get a rotary phone and for about five years. It finally came home I can still recall it vividly. It changed our lives. To me it was the first moment I understood the power of what getting access to technology meant and so probably led me to be doing what I'm doing today.\\n\\nWhat he's doing, since 2019, is leading both Google and its parent company, Alphabet, valued at $1.5 trillion. Worldwide, Google runs 90 percent of internet searches and 70 percent of smartphones. But its dominance was attacked this past February when Microsoft unveiled its new chatbot. In a race for AI dominance, in March, Google released its version named Bard.\\n\\nSissie Hsiao: It's really here to help you brainstorm ideas, to generate content, like a speech, or a blog post, or an email.\\n\\nWe were introduced to Bard by Google Vice President Sissie Hsiao and Senior Vice President James Manyika. The first thing we learned was that Bard does not look for answers on the internet like Google search does.\\n\\nSissie Hsiao: So I wanted to get inspiration from some of the best speeches in the world...\\n\\nBard's replies come from a self-contained program that was mostly self-taught\\u2014 our experience was unsettling.\\n\\nScott Pelley: Confounding, absolutely confounding.\\n\\nBard appeared to possess the sum of human knowledge...\\n\\n...with microchips more than 100-thousand times faster than the human brain. We asked Bard to summarize the New Testament. It did, in five seconds and 17 words. We asked for it in Latin--that took another four seconds. Then, we played with a famous six word short story, often attributed to Hemingway.\\n\\nScott Pelley: For sale. Baby shoes. Never worn.\\n\\nThe only prompt we gave was 'finish this story.' In five seconds\\u2026\\n\\nScott Pelley: Holy Cow! The shoes were a gift from my wife, but we never had a baby\\u2026\\n\\nFrom the six-word prompt, Bard created a deeply human tale with characters it invented -- including a man whose wife could not conceive and a stranger, grieving after a miscarriage, and longing for closure.\\n\\nScott Pelley: I am rarely speechless. I don't know what to make of this. Give me that story\\u2026\\n\\nWe asked for the story in verse. In five seconds, there was a poem written by a machine with breathtaking insight into the mystery of faith, Bard wrote \\\"she knew her baby's soul would always be alive.\\\" The humanity, at superhuman speed, was a shock.\\n\\nScott Pelley: How is this possible?\\n\\nJames Manyika told us that over several months, Bard read most everything on the internet and created a model of what language looks like. Rather than search, its answers come from this language model.\\n\\nBard is demonstrated at Google 60 Minutes\\n\\nJames Manyika: So, for example, if I said to you, Scott, peanut butter and?\\n\\nScott Pelley: Jelly.\\n\\nJames Manyika: Right. So, it tries and learns to predict, okay, so peanut butter usually is followed by jelly. It tries to predict the most probable next words, based on everything it's learned. So, it's not going out to find stuff, it's just predicting the next word.\\n\\nBut it doesn't feel like that. We asked Bard why it helps people and it replied \\u2013 quote \\u2013 \\\"because it makes me happy.\\\"\\n\\nScott Pelley: Bard, to my eye, appears to be thinking. Appears to be making judgments. That's not what's happening? These machines are not sentient. They are not aware of themselves.\\n\\nJames Manyika: They're not sentient. They're not aware of themselves. They can exhibit behaviors that look like that. Because keep in mind, they've learned from us. We're sentient beings. We have beings that have feelings, emotions, ideas, thoughts, perspectives. We've reflected all that in books, in novels, in fiction. So, when they learn from that, they build patterns from that. So, it's no surprise to me that the exhibited behavior sometimes looks like maybe there's somebody behind it. There's nobody there. These are not sentient beings.\\n\\nZimbabwe born, Oxford educated, James Manyika holds a new position at Google -- his job is to think about how AI and humanity will best co-exist.\\n\\nJames Manyika: AI has the potential to change many ways in which we've thought about society, about what we're able to do, the problems we can solve.\\n\\nBut AI itself will pose its own problems. Could Hemingway write a better short story? Maybe. But Bard can write a million before Hemingway could finish one. Imagine that level of automation across the economy.\\n\\nScott Pelley: A lot of people can be replaced by this technology.\\n\\nJames Manyika: Yes, there are some job occupations that'll start to decline over time. There are also new job categories that'll grow over time. But the biggest change will be the jobs that'll be changed. Something like more than two-thirds will have their definitions change. Not go away, but change. Because they're now being assisted by AI and by automation. So this is a profound change which has implications for skills. How do we assist people to build new skills? Learn to work alongside machines. And how do these complement what people do today.\\n\\nJames Manyika 60 Minutes\\n\\nSundar Pichai: This is going to impact every product across every company and so that's, that's why I think it's a very, very profound technology. And so, we are just in early days.\\n\\nScott Pelley: Every product in every company.\\n\\nSundar Pichai: That's right. AI will impact everything. So, for example, you could be a radiologist. You know, if I-- if I-- if you think about five to 10 years from now, you're gonna have a AI collaborator with you. It may triage. You come in the morning. You-- let's say you have 100 things to go through. It may say, 'These are the most serious cases you need to look at first.' Or when you're looking at something, it may pop up and say, 'You may have missed something important.' Why wouldn't we, why wouldn't we take advantage of a super-powered assistant to help you across everything you do? You may be a student trying to learn math or history. And, you know, you will have something helping you.\\n\\nWe asked Pichai what jobs would be disrupted, he said, \\\"knowledge workers.\\\" People like writers, accountants, architects and, ironically, software engineers. AI writes computer code too.\\n\\nToday Sundar Pichai walks a narrow line. A few employees have quit, some believing that Google's AI rollout is too slow, others--too fast. There are some serious flaws. James Manyika asked Bard about inflation. It wrote an instant essay in economics and recommended five books. But days later, we checked. None of the books is real. Bard fabricated the titles. This very human trait, error with confidence, is called, in the industry, hallucination.\\n\\nScott Pelley: Are you getting a lot of hallucinations?\\n\\nSundar Pichai: Yes, you know, which is expected. No one in the, in the field has yet solved the hallucination problems. All models do have this as an issue.\\n\\nScott Pelley: Is it a solvable problem?\\n\\nSundar Pichai: It's a matter of intense debate. I think we'll make progress.\\n\\nTo help cure hallucinations, Bard features a \\\"Google it\\\" button that leads to old-fashioned search. Google has also built safety filters into Bard to screen for things like hate speech and bias.\\n\\nScott Pelley: How great a risk is the spread of disinformation?\\n\\nSundar Pichai: AI will challenge that in a deeper way the scale of this problem will be much bigger.\\n\\nBigger problems, he says, with fake news and fake images.\\n\\nSundar Pichai: It will be possible with AI to create-- you know, a video easily. Where it could be Scott saying something, or me saying something, and we never said that. And it could look accurate. But you know, on a societal scale, you know, it can cause a lot of harm.\\n\\nScott Pelley: Is Bard safe for society?\\n\\nSundar Pichai: The way we have launched it today, as an experiment in a limited way, I think so. But we all have to be responsible in each step along the way.\\n\\nThis past spring, Google released an advanced version of Bard that can write software and connect to the internet. Google says it's developing even more sophisticated AI models.\\n\\nScott Pelley: You are letting this out slowly so that society can get used to it?\\n\\nSundar Pichai: That's one part of it. One part is also so that we get the user feedback. And we can develop more robust safety layers before we build, before we deploy more capable models.\\n\\nOf the AI issues we talked about, the most mysterious is called emergent properties. Some AI systems are teaching themselves skills that they weren't expected to have. How this happens is not well understood. For example, one Google AI program adapted, on its own, after it was prompted in the language of Bangladesh, which it was not trained to translate.\\n\\nJames Manyika: We discovered that with very few amounts of prompting in Bengali, it can now translate all of Bengali. So now, all of a sudden, we now have a research effort where we're now trying to get to a thousand languages.\\n\\nSundar Pichai: There is an aspect of this which we call-- all of us in the field call it as a \\\"black box.\\\" You know, you don't fully understand. And you can't quite tell why it said this, or why it got wrong. We have some ideas, and our ability to understand this gets better over time. But that's where the state of the art is.\\n\\nScott Pelley: You don't fully understand how it works. And yet, you've turned it loose on society?\\n\\nSundar Pichai: Yeah. Let me put it this way. I don't think we fully understand how a human mind works either.\\n\\nWas it from that black box, we wondered, that Bard drew its short story that seemed so disarmingly human?\\n\\nScott Pelley: It talked about the pain that humans feel. It talked about redemption. How did it do all of those things if it's just trying to figure out what the next right word is?\\n\\nSundar Pichai: I have had these experiences talking with Bard as well. There are two views of this. You know, there are a set of people who view this as, look, these are just algorithms. They're just repeating what it's seen online. Then there is the view where these algorithms are showing emergent properties, to be creative, to reason, to plan, and so on, right? And, and personally, I think we need to be, we need to approach this with humility. Part of the reason I think it's good that some of these technologies are getting out is so that society, you know, people like you and others can process what's happening. And we begin this conversation and debate. And I think it's important to do that.\\n\\nThe revolution in artificial intelligence is the center of a debate ranging from those who hope it will save humanity to those who predict doom. Google lies somewhere in the optimistic middle, introducing AI in steps so that civilization can get used to it. We saw what's coming next in machine learning earlier this year at Google's AI lab in London -- a company called Deepmind -- where the future looks something like this.\\n\\nScott Pelley: Look at that! Oh, my goodness\\u2026\\n\\nRaia Hadsell: They got a pretty good kick on them...\\n\\nScott Pelley: Ah! Goal!\\n\\nA soccer match at DeepMind looks like fun and games but, here's the thing: humans did not program these robots to play--they learned the game by themselves.\\n\\nRobots powered by AI taught themselves to play soccer. 60 Minutes\\n\\nRaia Hadsell: It's coming up with these interesting different strategies, different ways to walk, different ways to block\\u2026\\n\\nScott Pelley: And they're doing it, they're scoring over and over again\\u2026\\n\\nRaia Hadsell, vice president of Research and Robotics, showed us how engineers used motion capture technology to teach the AI program how to move like a human. But on the soccer pitch the robots were told only that the object was to score. The self-learning program spent about two weeks testing different moves. It discarded those that didn't work, built on those that did, and created all-stars.\\n\\nAnd with practice, they get better. Hadsell told us that, independent from the robots, the AI program plays thousands of games from which it learns and invents its own tactics.\\n\\nRaia Hadsell: Here we think that red player's going to grab it. But instead, it just stops it, hands it back, passes it back, and then goes for the goal.\\n\\nScott Pelley: And the AI figured out how to do that on its own.\\n\\nRaia Hadsell: That's right. That's right. And it takes a while. At first all the players just run after the ball together like a gaggle of, you know, 6-year-olds the first time they're playing ball. Over time what we start to see is now, 'Ah, what's the strategy? You go after the ball. I'm coming around this way. Or we should pass. Or I should block while you get to the goal.' So, we see all of that coordination emerging in the play.\\n\\nScott Pelley: This is a lot of fun. But what are the practical implications of what we're seeing here?\\n\\nRaia Hadsell: This is the type of research that can eventually lead to robots that can come out of the factories and work in other types of human environments. You know, think about mining, think about dangerous construction work or exploration or disaster recovery.\\n\\nRaia Hadsell is among 1,000 humans at DeepMind. The company was co-founded just 12 years ago by CEO Demis Hassabis.\\n\\nDemis Hassabis 60 Minutes\\n\\nDemis Hassabis: So if I think back to 2010 when we started nobody was doing AI. There was nothing going on in industry. People used to eye roll when we talked to them, investors, about doing AI. So, we couldn't, we could barely get two cents together to start off with which is crazy if you think about now the billions being invested into AI startups.\\n\\nCambridge, Harvard, MIT, Hassabis has degrees in computer science and neuroscience. His Ph.D. is in human imagination. And imagine this, when he was 12, in his age group, he was the number two chess champion in the world.\\n\\nIt was through games that he came to AI.\\n\\nDemis Hassabis: I've been working on AI for decades now, and I've always believed that it's gonna be the most important invention that humanity will ever make.\\n\\nScott Pelley: Will the pace of change outstrip our ability to adapt?\\n\\nDemis Hassabis: I don't think so. I think that we, you know, we're sort of an infinitely adaptable species. You know, you look at today, us using all of our smartphones and other devices, and we effortlessly sort of adapt to these new technologies. And this is gonna be another one of those changes like that.\\n\\nAmong the biggest changes at DeepMind was the discovery that self-learning machines can be creative. Hassabis showed us a game playing program that learns. It's called AlphaZero and it dreamed up a winning chess strategy no human had ever seen.\\n\\nScott Pelley: But this is just a machine. How does it achieve creativity?\\n\\nDemis Hassabis: It plays against itself tens of millions of times. So, it can explore parts of chess that maybe human chess players and programmers who program chess computers haven't thought about before.\\n\\nScott Pelley: It never gets tired. It never gets hungry. It just plays chess all the time.\\n\\nDemis Hassabis: Yes. It's kind of an amazing thing to see, because actually you set off AlphaZero in the morning and it starts off playing randomly. By lunchtime, you know, it's able to beat me and beat most chess players. And then by the evening, it's stronger than the world champion.\\n\\nDemis Hassabis sold DeepMind to Google in 2014. One reason, was to get his hands on this. Google has the enormous computing power that AI needs. This computing center is in Pryor, Oklahoma. But google has 23 of these, putting it near the top in computing power in the world. This is one of two advances that make AI ascendant now. First, the sum of all human knowledge is online and, second, brute force computing that \\\"very loosely approximates\\\" the neural networks and talents of the brain.\\n\\nGoogle data center 60 Minutes\\n\\nDemis Hassabis: Things like memory, imagination, planning, reinforcement learning, these are all things that are known about how the brain does it, and we wanted to replicate some of that in our AI systems.\\n\\nThose are some of the elements that led to DeepMind's greatest achievement so far -- solving an 'impossible' problem in biology.\\n\\nMost AI systems today do one or maybe two things well. The soccer robots, for example, can't write up a grocery list or book your travel or drive your car. The ultimate goal is what's called artificial general intelligence-- a learning machine that can score on a wide range of talents.\\n\\nScott Pelley: Would such a machine be conscious of itself?\\n\\nDemis Hassabis: So that's another great question. We-- you know, philosophers haven't really settled on a definition of consciousness yet, but if we mean by sort of self-awareness and-- these kinds of things-- you know, I think there's a possibility AI one day could be. I definitely don't think they are today. But I think, again, this is one of the fascinating scientific things we're gonna find out on this journey towards AI.\\n\\nEven unconscious, current AI is superhuman in narrow ways.\\n\\nBack in California, we saw Google engineers teaching skills that robots will practice continuously on their own.\\n\\nRobot: Push the blue cube to the blue triangle.\\n\\nThey comprehend instructions\\u2026\\n\\nAnd learn to recognize objects.\\n\\nRobot 106: What would you like?\\n\\nScott Pelley: How 'bout an apple?\\n\\nRyan: How about an apple.\\n\\nRobot 106: On my way, I will bring an apple to you.\\n\\nVincent Vanhoucke, senior director of Robotics, showed us how Robot 106 was trained on millions of images...\\n\\nRobot 106: I am going to pick up the apple.\\n\\n...and can recognize all the items on a crowded countertop.\\n\\nVincent Vanhoucke: If we can give the robot a diversity of experiences, a lot more different objects in different settings, the robot gets better at every one of them.\\n\\nNow that humans have pulled the forbidden fruit of artificial knowledge...\\n\\nScott Pelley: Thank you.\\n\\n...we start the genesis of a new humanity...\\n\\nScott Pelley: AI can utilize all the information in the world. What no human could ever hold in their head. And I wonder if humanity is diminished by this enormous capability that we're developing.\\n\\nJames Manyika: I think the possibilities of AI do not diminish humanity in any way. And in fact, in some ways, I think they actually raise us to even deeper, more profound questions.\\n\\nGoogle's James Manyika sees this moment as an inflection point.\\n\\nJames Manyika: I think we're constantly adding these, in, superpowers or capabilities to what humans can do in a way that expands possibilities, as opposed to narrow them, I think. So I don't think of it as diminishing humans, but it does raise some really profound questions for us. Who are we? What do we value? What are we good at? How do we relate with each other? Those become very, very important questions that are constantly gonna be, in one case-- sense exciting, but perhaps unsettling too.\\n\\nIt is an unsettling moment. Critics argue the rush to AI comes too fast -- while competitive pressure-- among giants like Google and start-ups you've never heard of, is propelling humanity into the future ready or not.\\n\\nSundar Pichai: But I think if take a 10-year outlook, it is so clear to me, we will have some form of very capable intelligence that can do amazing things. And we need to adapt as a society for it.\\n\\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai told us society must quickly adapt with regulations for AI in the economy, laws to punish abuse, and treaties among nations to make AI safe for the world.\\n\\nSundar Pichai: You know, these are deep questions. And, you know, we call this 'alignment.' You know, one way we think about: How do you develop AI systems that are aligned to human values-- and including-- morality? This is why I think the development of this needs to include not just engineers, but social scientists, ethicists, philosophers, and so on. And I think we have to be very thoughtful. And I think these are all things society needs to figure out as we move along.

A Taylor Hall. A Johnny Gaudreau. An Artemi Panarin. Heck, this offseason we probably would have settled for a Tyler Toffoli.\\n\\nBut there is none of that out there this offseason with what might be one of the weakest free-agency groups in years.\\n\\nSo who stands out?\\n\\nAlex Killorn from the Tampa Bay Lightning will be certain to get a lot of interest, while Jason Zucker could be eyeing up a significant contract after having a tremendous bounce-back year for the Pittsburgh Penguins.\\n\\nTyler Bertuzzi and Tomas Tatar are also solid top-six forwards that could be looking at big deals. But all of those players come with their own sets of issues, mainly revolving around age, injury and whether or not they will be worth the price or term they are able to command on the open market.\\n\\nThere is also that one player every offseason that played in the exact right situation to boost their value in a contract year, resulting in a free-agent contract that makes everybody fall out of their chairs. This year's candidate for that contract has to be former Maple Leafs forward Michael Bunting. His number has been fine in Toronto, but is he going to be able to duplicate that on another team, without that sort of talent around him, and be a good value for the contract he will almost certainly be able to command in a weak market?\\n\\nThings do not get any more encouraging on defense. Dmitry Orlov and Matt Dumba probably lead the class, while John Klingberg will be trying to hope that he can have a better free agency experience than he did a year ago when he had to settle for a one-year deal with the Anaheim Ducks.\\n\\nThe most intriguing players on the market might be the former big-name stars that are at the tail end of their careers that might have a little something to give in a specific role.\\n\\nSpeaking of which.....\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Bleacher Report\", \"author\": \"Julia Stumbaugh\", \"title\": \"2023 NHL Draft Results: Team-by-Team Grades for Notable Picks\", \"description\": \"The 2023 NHL Draft, which took place June 28-29, had a few surprises in store for hockey fans.

As they likely won't be ready to join the NHL immediately, why not wait instead for KHL phenom Matvei Michkov, who is signed in Russia through 2026? Michkov was still on the board at No. 6.\\n\\nBoston Bruins: B-\\n\\nChristopher Pelosi (C), Round 3, Pick 28\\n\\nThe Bruins took Pelosi at 92nd overall, 35 spots ahead of his pre-draft ranking, so Boston scouts saw something in this 6-foot-1 center they liked in the NAHL and USHL last season. Pelosi will play in the NCAA next season with Quinnipiac, and his performance could show how much of a shot he's going to have in the NHL.\\n\\nBuffalo Sabres: B+\\n\\nZach Benson (L), Round 1, Pick 13\\n\\nThe Sabres' front office has been tracking Benson for two seasons, per NHL.com's Jourdon LaBarber. He played with Matthew Savoie, the Sabres' No. 9 pick of 2022, in the WHL last season. Buffalo might plan to see Benson and Savoie in the NHL together someday.\\n\\nCalgary Flames: B\\n\\nSamuel Honzek (L), Round 1, Pick 16\\n\\nHonzek is 18 years old but already measures in at 6-foot-4 and 194 pounds, giving the Flames reason to hope his success at the WHL level could translate to the NHL. Calgary chose to stick with a sizeable center over some of the higher-scoring wingers still available because the team considered Honzek the best player available overall at No. 16, per The Athletic's Julian McKenzie.\\n\\nCarolina Hurricanes: B+\\n\\nBradley Nadeau (L), Round 1, Pick 30\\n\\nNadeau was named the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL)'s MVP last season after leading all skaters with 68 assists and 113 points in 54 games. He could fit in with a team built around skilled scorers.\\n\\nChicago Blackhawks: A+\\n\\nConnor Bedard (C), Round 1, Pick 1; Oliver Moore (C), Round 1, Pick 19\\n\\nThe Hawks added potentially generational scoring talent to a team starved for offense with Bedard. The Hawks also originally wanted to trade up for Moore, who established himself as one of the draft's best skaters with the U.S. National Team Development Program last season, so Chicago likely considers him a steal at No. 19.\\n\\nColorado Avalanche: A-\\n\\nCalum Ritchie (C), Round 1, Pick 27\\n\\nRitchie played last season with an injured shoulder, which was part of the reason he dropped to the bottom of the first round. Had he been healthy he likely would have gone much higher and could end up as a steal with NHL potential for the Avs.\\n\\nColumbus Blue Jackets: A\\n\\nAdam Fantilli (C), Round 1, Pick 3\\n\\nThe Blue Jackets got to snag one of the draft's most talented scorers when Fantilli was passed over by the Anaheim Ducks at No. 2. For a team struggling despite having Johnny Gaudreau at wing, the addition of a player projected to be a top-line center will be key to a bounce-back season.\\n\\nDallas Stars: C\\n\\nTristan Bertucci (D), Round 2, Pick 29\\n\\nThe Stars saw 60 picks go by before they got to have a say, so it was a relatively weak draft class for the Stars. Bertucci will still be a prospect to watch. He has developed into a strong skater and a two-way defenseman over the last OHL season.\\n\\nDetroit Red Wings: A-\\n\\nNate Danielson (C), Round 1, Pick 9; Axel Sandin Pellikka (D), Round 1, Pick 17; Trey Augustine (G), Round 2, Pick 9\\n\\nThe Red Wings need a center, defense and goaltending. They got viable prospects in all three areas with their first three picks.\\n\\nEdmonton Oilers: C\\n\\nBeau Akey (D), Round 2, Pick 24; Nathaniel Day (G), Round 6, Pick 24\\n\\nAkey saw his OHL ice time drop toward the end of last season, while Day put up a 3.91 GAA and .874 SV% in 32 games behind a fifth-place OHL team. Their NHL potential remains to be seen.\\n\\nFlorida Panthers: B+\\n\\nGracyn Sawchyn (C), Round 2, Pick 31\\n\\nScouts like to describe Sawchyn as \\\"gritty\\\" and says he's a fan of Matthew Tkachuk, so he sounds like the exact kind of player Florida wants in their system.\\n\\nLos Angeles Kings: C\\n\\nJakub Dvorak (D), Round 2, Pick 22\\n\\nDvorak is a 6-foot-5 defenseman and a lefty, which the Kings need on their blueline, but he suffered multiple injuries last season and is under contract in the Czech Republic for another year.\\n\\nMinnesota Wild: B+\\n\\nCharlie Stramel (C), Round 1, Pick 21\\n\\nThe Wild need depth down the middle. Stramel, who proved himself to be a viable two-way center at the University of Wisconsin last season, could be that center.\\n\\nMontreal Canadiens: B-\\n\\nDavid Reinbacher (D), Round 1, Pick 5; Jacob Fowler (G), Round 3, Pick 5\\n\\nThe Habs wanted a defender, and they passed on Michkov to get him. Can this team, which needs a dynamic scorer, afford that? Boston College goalie Fowler, meanwhile, adds depth to Montreal's net.\\n\\nNashville Predators: B+\\n\\nMatthew Wood (R), Round 1, Pick 15; Tanner Molendyk (D), Round 1, Pick 24\\n\\nNashville got goalscoring potential in Wood and a quick-skating center in Molendyk. Both are likely to earn shots at the NHL as the Predators begin a rebuild.\\n\\nNew Jersey Devils: B-\\n\\nLenni Hameenaho (R), Round 2, Pick 26\\n\\nHameenaho skated last season with adults in the Finnish pro league and saw his ice time progress throughout the year, but says he will need \\\"a few more years\\\" before he's NHL-ready.\\n\\nNew York Islanders: B+\\n\\nDanny Nelson (C), Round 2, Pick 17\\n\\nNelson played as a defenseman before transitioning to center, giving him a rare skill range that makes him an intriguing pick.\\n\\nNew York Rangers: A\\n\\nGabriel Perreault (R), Round 1, Pick 23\\n\\nPerreault was projected by some to go in the top 10 of the draft and has the potential to end up as a top-six winger after a record-breaking season with the USNTDP.\\n\\nOttawa Senators: C\\n\\nHoyt Stanley (D), Round 4, Pick 12\\n\\nThe Senators had no picks in the first three rounds. Stanley will be going to Cornell next season, where he will have the chance to develop NHL potential over the next few years.\\n\\nPhiladelphia Flyers: A\\n\\nMatvei Michkov (R), Round 1, Pick 7\\n\\nMichkov might not play in the NHL until 2026-27, but for a player seen by some as the best Russian prospect since Alex Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin he might be worth the wait.\\n\\nPittsburgh Penguins: B-\\n\\nBrayden Yager (C), Round 1, Pick 14\\n\\nThe Penguins cited Yager's two-way game as the reason they chose him over more highly-ranked prospects still available. He will likely need at least another season in the minors before he is ready for the NHL.\\n\\nSan Jose Sharks: A-\\n\\nWilliam Smith (C), Round 1, Pick 4; Quentin Musty (L), Round 1, Pick 26\\n\\nThe Sharks passed over Michkov in favor of Smith, who will play at Boston College next season. For a team needing improvements in the near future, having a player develop in North America is a plus. Musty, who has NHL potential as a top-six wing, is a solid late first-rounder.\\n\\nSeattle Kraken: A-\\n\\nEduard Sale (L), Round 1, Pick 20\\n\\nSale was likely the best overall asset available at No. 20. He was ranked higher on several mock draft boards after being named the top Czech league's rookie of the year last season.\\n\\nSt. Louis Blues: B\\n\\nDalibor Dvorsky (C), Round 1, Pick 10\\n\\nDvorsky was the Blues' first top-10 pick in 15 years after stellar international U18 showings for Sweden, but it remains to be seen how he will play at the NHL level. His numbers have excelled in the junior Swedish circuits but fallen when playing against pros.\\n\\nTampa Bay Lightning: B\\n\\nEthan Gauthier (R), Round 2, Pick 5\\n\\nThe Lightning did not pick until Round 2 but still found a winger with NHL potential in Gauthier, who stood out as a deft skater last year in the QMJHL.\\n\\nToronto Maple Leafs: B-\\n\\nEaston Cowan (R), Round 1, Pick 28\\n\\nCowan was not projected as a first-round pick, so his selection by the Leafs at No. 28 came as a surprise. Toronto will hope his recent surge, where he scored 18 points in 20 playoff games for the London Knights, is an indication of his ceiling.\\n\\nVancouver Canucks: B+\\n\\nTom Willander (D), Round 1, Pick 11\\n\\nThe Canucks have been \\\"very high\\\" on Willander for some time, per The Athletic's Rick Dhaliwal. They want a right-shooting defenseman to play alongside Quinn Hughes. To get their guy, however, they passed on forwards which could have added some much-needed scoring to the lineup.\\n\\nVegas Golden Knights: B+\\n\\nDavid Edstrom (C), Round 1, Pick 32\\n\\nEdstrom has proven to be a solid two-way center in the Swedish junior leagues and at international tournaments. He made his first jump to the SHL last season and has the potential to develop into an NHL center.\\n\\nWashington Capitals: B\\n\\nRyan Leonard (R), Round 1, Pick 8\\n\\nThe Capitals just missed out on Michkov and grabbed Leonard instead. Leonard was not a consensus top-10 pick, but earned power play and penalty kill experience with the USNTDP last season, upping the value of the role he could play for Washington.\\n\\nWinnipeg Jets: A-\\n\\nColby Barlow (L), Round 1, Pick 18\\n\\nBarlow's OHL highlights feature a heavy, by all appearances NHL-ready shot which helped him put up 46 goals in his draft season. Scouts report his overall game needs rounding out, but the Jets are betting they can build on that scoring potential.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"TheBlaze\", \"author\": \"Andrew Chapados\", \"title\": \"Some NHL stars 'disappointed' that league removed Pride jerseys, were 'proud wearing it'\", \"description\": \"Some of the National Hockey League's biggest stars have expressed their disappointment with the league's decision to cancel gay-pride-themed warm-up jerseys.NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said that the use of specialty warm-up jerseys had \\\"become a distraction\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.theblaze.com/news/stamkos-mcdavid-nhl-pride-jerseys\", \"text\": \"Some of the National Hockey League's biggest stars have expressed their disappointment with the league's decision to cancel gay-pride-themed warm-up jerseys.\\n\\nNHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said that the use of specialty warm-up jerseys had \\\"become a distraction\\\" and took away from the fact that all of the teams \\\"in some form or another host nights in honor of various groups or causes.\\\"\\n\\nAs reported by TimCast, some of the NHL's top stars took issue with the announcement, which was primarily in response to backlash over gay pride jerseys.\\n\\nConnor McDavid, the league's biggest star and 2022-2023 leader in goals, points, and assists, said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s disappointing to see.\\\"\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not my call, but obviously it\\u2019s disappointing,\\\" he added, according to CTV News. \\u201cI certainly can\\u2019t speak for every organization. ...

Technology rebounded from a challenging 2022 and many large tech companies are performing quite well this year.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is up +35%, Microsoft +33%, Amazon +39%, and Google is +40%. In terms of contribution to the S&P 500\\u2019s year-to-date return, Apple and Microsoft represent roughly half of its 2023 performance.

To conclude, it\\u2019s distinctly getting more concentrated at the top. For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay pre-loaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal, are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%. Digital wallets have tons of advantages, that we are embracing. When we attend Tampa Bay Lightning games, we love having our season tickets easily accessible on our phones (via the Apple Pay wallet), as well as our timed parking pass. When we travel, loading the airline ticket into our Apple Pay wallet is much more convenient than printing out a paper boarding pass. Others are using digital wallets to track their expenses, budget properly, and even help them easily pay their bills.

To skip our detailed analysis of the technology industry and current developments within it, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now.\\n\\nThe technology industry has seen a stellar 2023 so far, with most investors viewing this sector as the market's savior amidst inflation concerns. Part of the reason why tech has been doing so well is, of course, the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Most tech companies of significance today are making significant headway in the field of AI as the corporations of the world take part in a global AI arms race. No tech company wants to be left behind in the face of this rapidly transforming market as AI continues to revolutionize the tech industry like the Internet did in 1995. As such, some of the best large-cap tech companies today are going above and beyond to compete in the AI race and make profits for themselves and for their investors along the way.\\n\\nWhile investing in AI is considered to be the best way to invest in big tech in general by many investors, it isn't the only thing of interest going on in the big tech regime. Another thing to keep an eye on is the rapidity with which many major big tech companies are continuing to grow and assert their dominance in the market, apart from their AI endeavors. One example is Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) recent deal to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) for approximately $69 billion. Those concerned about the rapid growth of big tech companies, like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), have been opposed to this deal. However, on July 14, an appellant court judge in the US denied the FTC's bid to delay this deal, leaving Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) free to continue its expansion. On July 17, CNBC invited Big Technology founder Alex Kantrowitz to discuss this deal when he noted the following:\\n\\n\\\"I think it is priced in. I think that the markets have been watching what's been going on here and they've come to the conclusion that Microsoft's gonna win, probably in the last few weeks. So you'll see a small bump when this thing actually goes through but the real impact is gonna be long term, like let's see how Activision actually adds to the Microsoft set of gaming tools and it actually might end up impacting the business in the bottomline because once you put those two together there could be some significant growth. Some of these concerns that people have been bringing that Microsoft might corner off the competition or the Xbox might end up taking exclusivity on some of these games, that could actually come to fruition now and once that happens we could see something serious with the stock.\\\"\\n\\nThis type of expansion is something that is been seen across the tech industry in many companies in the form of deals, partnerships, and acquisitions, among much more. Many of these expansions are also relevant to the field of AI as tech companies continue to jump on the AI bandwagon this year. Due to all this, other renowned tech companies like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) are also setting the stage for themselves to join the big tech cohort of companies. Considering the popularity of the tech industry in 2023, many of these companies may even become some of the best long-term tech stocks to buy right now. Some may even be classified as undervalued tech stocks considering their future potential and current valuation. Keeping this in mind, we have compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy now.\\n\\nBest Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now\\n\\nPhoto by Alexandr Bormotin on Unsplash\\n\\nOur Methodology\\n\\nWe picked large-cap tech stocks that are highly popular among hedge funds in 2023 for our list below, using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter when 943 hedge funds were tracked.

Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 67\\n\\nOracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) is a systems software company based in Austin, Texas.

We believe these results highlight ORCL\\u2019s ability to effectively cross-sell and upsell apps and infrastructure, as well as the emergence of the company\\u2019s cloud platform as a competitive offering.\\u201d\\n\\nLike Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) is also one of the most renowned tech companies in the world today, making it popular with hedge funds.\\n\\n12. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n\\u201cIt is among what are considered to be the great technology companies, like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel, that one is apt to see some of the greatest confusion between short-term financial results and share price movements, on the one hand, and long-term financial results. The former are exceedingly difficult to predict. Long term results are relatively easy to predict, because they are bound by the limiting realities of the business model. In the case of AMD, that is the business of being a large-scale semi-conductor manufacturer with a more dominant competitor that has a scale economy advantage. Here\\u2019s what people see, remember and act upon. In the past several years, AMD has been the best performing major technology stock. It\\u2019s outperformed Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidia\\u2026\\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 96\\n\\nHolding 1.5 million shares in the company, GQG Partners was the largest shareholder in ServiceNow, Inc.

(NYSE:NOW) in its April 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n\\u201cDespite a difficult macro environment, US-based software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) proved resilient with a healthy combination of organic growth and profitability. Subscription revenues grew 24% year-on-year (27% constant currency) to $2.0 billion and operating income grew 26% year-on-year to $552 million. The company\\u2019s core operating metrics were equally strong with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year and renewal rates holding firm at 98%. ServiceNow\\u2019s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value. Overall, we continue to believe that ServiceNow is one of the highest quality software businesses around as the combination of consistent growth at scale, robust free cash flow generation and a large addressable market make it an attractive opportunity.\\u201d\\n\\n10.

We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi\\u2019s technological leadership; pricing power; and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, 5G, and IoT; will allow the company to sustain strong earnings growth over the next several years.\\u201d\\n\\n8. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\\n\\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a provider of technology infrastructure and marketing reach for merchants, brands, retailers, and businesses. It operates an e-commerce platform and is based in Hangzhou, China.\\n\\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) was spotted in the 13F holdings of 128 hedge funds in the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $5.9 billion.\\n\\nColin Sebastian, an analyst at Baird, reiterated an Outperform rating on shares of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) on July 17. The analyst also maintains a $115 price target on the stock.\\n\\nHere's what Oakmark Funds said about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n\\u201cAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) (China) was the top detractor for the quarter. Sentiment in Chinese equities has degraded after the initial excitement from China\\u2019s reopening earlier in the year. Incremental macroeconomic data coming out of China indicates that the Covid-19 re-opening bounce is fading, and the economy is struggling to sustain healthy growth. Political tensions between the U.S. and China are also further weighing on investor sentiment. As the largest e-commerce platform in China, Alibaba\\u2019s share price has been caught up in this storm. The company has also continued to face intense competition from the likes of short video players and traditional e-commerce companies. Indeed, Alibaba has lost market share, which we expect will continue. But despite these negative factors, it remains an extremely important platform in China and continues to generate significant free cash flow. In the most recent completed fiscal year, the company generated $25B of free cash flow, which is 12% of the current market capitalization. Today, its core commerce business trades at approximately 5x EBITA, a valuation we deem much too cheap, even with the headwinds noted above. But valuation alone is often not enough to unlock value. Alibaba\\u2019s management team is proactively working for minority shareholders. The company has been aggressive with share repurchases and with the recent formation of a capital management committee. Our conversations with the company indicate there is a high probability that more shareholder returns will be coming. In addition, the company recently announced a major restructuring that will effectively break up the company and separately list various businesses within Alibaba. Today, the market is assigning little to no value to these businesses and having a market quote may force investors to give Alibaba value for these assets. Whether or not the restructuring works, we appreciate management\\u2019s efforts to help unlock value in what is clearly an undervalued stock.\\u201d\\n\\n7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\\n\\nAs of July 17, Erik Woodring, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, maintains an Overweight rating on shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

The losses were primarily influenced by the difficult market circumstances for high-risk assets, particularly impacting hedge funds with a long-biased approach and/or higher volatility. This marked the weakest performance for the hedge fund industry since 2018 when it also posted a 2.4% loss. Looking at the five-year performance, hedge funds have achieved a compounded annual return of +4.2%, demonstrating a more favorable performance compared to bonds, which experienced a decline of 2.0%.

Hedge funds managed by The Citco Group Limited experienced a weighted-average return of -7.02% for the entire year. Smaller funds generally outperformed larger ones, as indicated by the median return of -2.86%. HFR also highlighted that macro strategies, including fundamental commodity, discretionary, and quantitative trend-following CTA sub-strategies, were the leading hedge fund strategies globally.\\n\\nDespite the dull performance of hedge funds, Citadel, led by Ken Griffin, achieved an exceptional feat by generating an unprecedented $16 billion in profits for its clients in 2022. This performance not only surpassed other players in the industry but also stands as one of the most prominent financial successes in history. Chairman Rick Sopher of LCH Investments commented:\\n\\n\\u201cThe largest gains were once again made by the large multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, DE Shaw and Millennium. The strong gains they have generated in recent years reflect their increasing dominance in strategies which do not depend on rising asset prices, and their substantial size.\\u201d\\n\\nIndividual investors often look up to elite hedge funds and try to imitate their performance.

(NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\\n\\n\\u201cThe pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.\\u201d\\n\\n24.

The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 95\\n\\nOn June 27, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock saw a slight increase in pre-market trading after Bank of America expressed confidence in the company's strategic direction. Despite concerns regarding the box office, streaming business, and other challenges, analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich maintained a Buy rating and set a price target of $135 on the shares. The analyst acknowledged that some recent content, including the Pixar film Elemental, did not meet audience expectations, but attributed this to production circumstances during the pandemic and past leadership.\\n\\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. According to Insider Monkey\\u2019s first quarter database, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was part of 95 hedge fund portfolios, with Nelson Peltz\\u2019s Trian Partners holding the largest stake, consisting of 5.9 million shares worth $592.4 million.\\n\\nVGI Partners made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its 2022 annual investor letter:\\n\\n\\u201cThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a diversified media conglomerate operating media networks, theme parks, film and TV studios and direct-to-consumer streaming services. It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, ABC and Marvel\\u2019s Avengers. Disney\\u2019s share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022, presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily, the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent. Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalize over the next several years. To put this in perspective, Disney+ (DTC sub-segment) currently generates operating losses of over US$3.3bn (a negative 14% operating margin) compared to operating margins at its nearest streaming competitor, Netflix, of +15.5%\\u2026\\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 96\\n\\nServiceNow, Inc.

Subscription revenues grew 24% year-on-year (27% constant currency) to $2.0 billion and operating income grew 26% year-on-year to $552 million. The company\\u2019s core operating metrics were equally strong with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year and renewal rates holding firm at 98%. ServiceNow\\u2019s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value. Overall, we continue to believe that ServiceNow is one of the highest quality software businesses around as the combination of consistent growth at scale, robust free cash flow generation and a large addressable market make it an attractive opportunity.\\u201d\\n\\n21.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n\\u201cFor our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%. Over the last several years, P2P payments have made tremendous strides in adoption and usage. Whenever something becomes a verb, like just Venmo me $10, you know that it has been widely embraced by society. The concept of allowing individuals to pay each other, via our smartphones, has clearly taken off. However, the biggest flaw or issue (that we\\u2019ve identified) is interoperability. Digital wallets allow users to pick their favorite card to make payments with. P2P acts as a bit of a \\u201cwalled garden\\u201d and its funding source is still siloed. This is a critical aspect for future P2P growth, as Venmo users can\\u2019t pay Cash App users who can\\u2019t pay Zelle users. Visa is launching Visa+ next year and it has already signed up PayPal and Venmo as its initial customers. The global card networks seem like the perfect piece to solve this interoperability puzzle. Of course, this will only work if banks allow an independent network to serve as the gateway between disparate user bases\\u2026\\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 108\\n\\nNetflix, Inc.

The analyst noted that Netflix will potentially gain 2.2 million subscribers in the second-quarter, up from 1.55 million, given a \\\"more modest churn\\\" from the paid sharing announcements in the US and Canada, in addition to \\\"solid\\\" app download projections.

(NYSE:JPM) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n\\u201cIt will be interesting to see what kind of policy decisions are made around regulation for institutions that are between $100 billion of assets and $700 billion of assets. As JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\\u2019s purchase of First Republic shows, scale is a competitive advantage. It now has 13% of total US deposits and it manages 21% of America\\u2019s credit card spending. With additional regulatory burdens coming, banks are facing a profitability headwind and 100 to 300 basis points of possible ROE erosion. The banking sector is facing a slow-moving crisis, but we aren\\u2019t sure it is enough to sink the overall health of the US consumer or economy. Credit will contract and lending standards will continue to rise. However, we do not see this problem escalating to the size and scale of previous banking crises. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase clearly sees the risks these FINTECH companies present. In his annual letter to shareholders, he stated that all incumbent banks should be \\u201cscared shitless\\u201d of these FINTECH rivals. Not only is his bank being attacked from multiple angles, but Apple just launched a cash management program with Goldman Sachs. On the first day of Apple\\u2019s savings program, it raised $400 million and eclipsed $1 billion in its first four days. Dimon specifically labeled Apple a bank the other day in an interview when he said, \\u201cIt may not have insured deposits, but it\\u2019s a bank.

We initiated the position in November 2021 and, despite crystalizing a gain on the investment, we are admittedly a little frustrated with how this has played out.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n\\u201cDespite this, the S&P 500 is up 7% this year and the Nasdaq is up +11%. Technology rebounded from a challenging 2022 and many large tech companies are performing quite well this year. Through mid-May 2023, year-to-date performance of some of the most popular and largest tech names is impressive. For tech companies with market capitalizations over $1 trillion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is up +35%, Microsoft +33%, Amazon +39%, and Google is +40%. In terms of contribution to the S&P 500\\u2019s year-to-date return, Apple and Microsoft represent roughly half of its 2023 performance. Apple, and Microsoft now account for 13.9% of the entire S&P 500 or 80% more concentrated than 2008. For additional perspective, Apple\\u2019s market cap is at $2.8 trillion and that is larger than the market cap of the entire Russell 2000. To conclude, it\\u2019s distinctly getting more concentrated at the top. For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible.

When we travel, loading the airline ticket into our Apple Pay wallet is much more convenient than printing out a paper boarding pass. Others are using digital wallets to track their expenses, budget properly, and even help them easily pay their bills.

Nvidia is a good example of a select growth stock bought opportunistically where our long-term thesis has bloomed. We initiated the position in the fourth quarter of 2018 knowing that inference and training in the data center was an interesting although still early-stage growth driver. We knew that GPUs could be used to solve complex computing problems, but we didn\\u2019t know how quickly the training and learning efforts by Nvidia\\u2019s mega cap customers would hit an inflection point. Volatility in the gaming business created the entry point into the stock and we have built the position accordingly over time. Since the end of 2021, the stock\\u2019s portfolio weight grew from 4.5% to a high of 7.2% earlier in the second quarter before we trimmed it to manage our overall position sizing. We will continue to monitor and adjust Nvidia\\u2019s position sizing to manage risk. Despite the sharp run up, we believe the company\\u2019s long-term runway remains compelling due to its advantaged positioning in a very large addressable market for GPUs. The current valuation looks expensive, yet Nvidia has real earnings and cash flow and the longer-term multiple looks more reasonable because of GPU pricing power.\\u201d\\n\\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 136\\n\\nSalesforce, Inc.

Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million). UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\\n\\n\\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (U.S.) was the top contributor to the Fund\\u2019s performance for the quarter. Alphabet\\u2019s first-quarter search revenue growth accelerated slightly sequentially, which was notable given that advertising spending has decreased across the board. Management cited the company\\u2019s travel and retail segments for their strong performance in contrast to the declines experienced in the finance and in the media and entertainment businesses. Advertising spending has also stabilized at YouTube, and the focus on \\u201cshorts\\u201d has driven strong viewership growth. In the near term, YouTube\\u2019s investment in shorts may not generate significant revenue, but we believe its profitability will accelerate over time. Alphabet\\u2019s cloud business reached GAAP profitability this quarter, moving from a -12% margin this quarter last year to a 3% margin this quarter. On the AI front, Alphabet upgraded Bard to run on its more powerful PaLM language model, and Bard can now assist with coding and software development. CEO Sundar Pichai compared AI\\u2019s evolution to the transition from desktop to mobile computing a decade ago and said there is \\u201ca lot more to come\\u201d in terms of its consumer AI applications. CFO Ruth Porat revised 2023 capital expenditures guidance due to higher spending on data center construction and servers that will support AI developments in consumer products, advertiser tools and the cloud business.

It isn't the first time.\\n\\nThe Seahawks have been unconventional for years and it always works out. They pushed it to the limit last season. They traded Russell Wilson, who made nine Pro Bowls in 10 Seahawks seasons, to the Denver Broncos. Teams do not trade franchise quarterbacks in their prime, but the Seahawks did. They didn't do much to replace Wilson either. The football world chuckled that their QB battle would be between Geno Smith and Drew Lock.\\n\\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been successful for a long time and we\\u2019re proud of that,\\u201d Carroll said in March 2022, according to the Seattle Times. \\u201cWe know what we\\u2019re doing.\\u201d\\n\\nThat's hard to deny. The Seahawks looked very smart by the end of the season, making the doubters look dumb. Wilson fell apart in Denver, though poor coaching didn't help that. Smith won the job in preseason and had a remarkable year. It was the kind of career revival you don't see often. The Seahawks had all of those draft picks from the Wilson trade and ended up with the better quarterback, at least for last season.\\n\\nThe Seahawks spent all offseason getting ridiculed, then made the playoffs. It was inexplicable that a team could trade a nine-time Pro Bowl quarterback, replace him with a 32-year-old washout who hadn't started regularly since 2014, and get better. But the Seahawks did it.\\n\\nCarroll, and general manager John Schneider, proved everyone wrong again.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\u201cPeople don\\u2019t get it,\\u201d Carroll said on KIRO-AM during last season, via The Athletic. \\u201cI love to show them. I love to prove it to them.\\u201d\\n\\nIt's not like the Seahawks are back to their 2012-14 heights yet. There's work to be done. Seattle did go just 9-8 and caught a break to make the playoffs when the Detroit Lions beat the Green Bay Packers in the final game of the regular season. The defense gave up too many big plays. Fair or not, Smith will need to prove last season wasn't a fluke. The Seahawks were blasted three times last season by NFC West rival San Francisco, including in a wild-card playoff game.\\n\\nBut let's assume Carroll has a good plan.\\n\\nSeattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll's faith in quarterback Geno Smith was rewarded last season. (Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images)\\n\\nSeattle's surprising season was led by Smith's career year and a draft class that will bolster the Seahawks going forward. They hit on many picks, and it didn't hurt to have all those Broncos picks. Then this year's draft haul got the fourth-best average grade among analysts, via Football Outsiders. If that draft hits like experts think it did, Seattle will be in good shape for a while.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe Seahawks are set up to be pretty good for the next few years, though it's worth wondering how much longer Carroll will be around. He's 71 years old and very few coaches have lasted that long. But he also knows that taking another group to a Super Bowl, after moving on from a franchise quarterback, would solidify his Hall of Fame resume.\\n\\nCarroll's ability shouldn't be questioned after what he pulled off last season after trading Wilson. He knows what he's doing.\\n\\nOffseason grade\\n\\nThe Seahawks got better this offseason. Maybe much better. They signed defensive lineman Dre'Mont Jones to a three-year deal worth more than $51 million. Safety Julian Love and defensive lineman Jarran Reed were added on smaller deals. Then came a fun reunion, with linebacker Bobby Wagner rejoining the team after one season on the Los Angeles Rams. Wagner had the top Pro Football Focus grade among all linebackers last season. Those were much-needed additions to the defense. There were no crucial losses either. Then the draft class, bolstered by picks from the Broncos, looked very good. Cornerback Devon Witherspoon was added with the fifth overall pick (thanks, Denver), and with the 20th pick Seattle took Jaxon Smith-Njigba, the top receiver in the class. In the second round the Seahawks added edge rusher Derick Hall and running back Zach Charbonnet. Seattle did all that and still was able to re-sign quarterback Geno Smith.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGrade: A\\n\\nQuarterback report\\n\\nGeno Smith was fantastic in a Week 1 win over the Broncos, completing 23-of-28 passes for 195 yards and two touchdowns. After years of languishing as a backup, it was his time in the sun.\\n\\n\\\"They wrote me off. I ain't write back though,\\\" Smith said in a memorable quote to ESPN.\\n\\nAnd it was supposed to fall apart after that. It didn't. Smith, who failed quickly as a second-round pick of the New York Jets, maintained a high level all season. He led the NFL in completion percentage. He threw for 4,282 yards, 30 touchdowns and had a 100.9 passer rating. That rating was better than Joe Burrow and Josh Allen, among others. He signed a three-year, $75 million deal (with $30 million more possible in incentives) in the offseason to stay in Seattle. It was one of the best stories in the NFL last season, and there's no great reason to believe Smith can't repeat it.\\n\\nBetMGM odds breakdown\\n\\nI'll take the Seahawks at +195 at BetMGM to win the NFC West (those odds have come down significantly over the offseason). They made the playoffs last season and then got better this offseason. There is the concern about the way the 49ers dominated them last season, but San Francisco's quarterback questions and the odds have me taking the Seahawks. I'll also take the over on 8.5 wins and for Seattle to make the playoffs at -120. This Seahawks team is poised for a nice season.\\n\\nYahoo's fantasy take\\n\\nFrom Yahoo's Scott Pianowski: \\\"Tyler Lockett is a little pricier in Yahoo leagues than he is in national ADP, but that doesn\\u2019t faze me. He fits one of my favorite fantasy themes, the boring value veteran who is priced for profit.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Lockett\\u2019s end-of-year ranks in standard leagues have been remarkably consistent over the last five seasons: WR11 WR15, WR11, WR11, WR13. And yet you can still land him as the WR20 in early Yahoo drafts. I get that he\\u2019s entering his age-31 season, and the Seahawks have other buzzy receivers on the roster \\u2014 alpha DK Metcalf, and rookie hotshot Jaxon Smith-Njigba. But Seattle\\u2019s target tree is fairly narrow \\u2014 the tight ends and running backs don\\u2019t catch a lot of passes \\u2014 and QB Geno Smith earned circle of trust privileges last year. This offense can support multiple wide receivers. I am confident Lockett will be a proactive part of my 2023 fantasy portfolio.\\\"\\n\\nStat to remember\\n\\nSeattle's pass defense was average last season. It was 13th in passing yards allowed, 14th in passing TDs allowed and 13th in passer rating allowed. The pass D was 17th in Football Outsiders' DVOA. That's an area in which the Seahawks could make a jump. Adding cornerback Devon Witherspoon, the fifth overall pick, to go with 2022 rookie surprise Tariq Woolen could give the Seahawks an elite cornerback duo. At safety, Quandre Diggs is very good and the team added Julian Love in free agency. The difference between the secondary being good and great could be Jamal Adams. Adams suffered a season-ending quad injury in Week 1 last season. If the three-time Pro Bowler can rebound, he's a playmaker and disruptor at strong safety. He'd add to the depth and versatility of the secondary.\\n\\n\\\"It's an area that I'm really fired up about,\\\" coach Pete Carroll said about his secondary, via the team's site.\\n\\nBurning question\\n\\nHow will the Seahawks' skill-position players fit together?\\n\\nThere were some chuckles when the Seahawks used a second-round pick on running back Zach Charbonnet. The Seahawks had Kenneth Walker III coming off a strong rookie season. But of course the Seahawks used a high pick on another back. Again, they're unconventional. Now how will Walker and Charbonnet fit together? Walker had a lot of negative runs but was also a big-play threat every time he touched the ball. He finished with 1,050 yards last season. Charbonnet will probably be a more consistent runner and he's better in the passing game. Walker was very good last season and should start off with a bigger share of the snaps, but if the Seahawks are willing to trade big plays for reliability then Charbonnet could change that split during the season.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe receiver room is crowded too. DK Metcalf will be the No. 1 receiver but there is some overlap between the skill sets of Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Smith-Njigba is a very good prospect, but Lockett has been a productive player for years. Lockett won't be phased out of the Seahawks offense. It's hard to figure out how Metcalf, Lockett and Smith-Njigba all get enough targets to reach 1,000 yards, especially on a team that still likes to run the ball.\\n\\nBest-case scenario\\n\\nWe're starting to get to the point in the countdown in which, if you squint hard enough, you can see a Super Bowl upside with these teams. Seattle's offense should be excellent if rookies Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Zach Charbonnet make an impact right away. The defense added several starters in the draft and free agency. If the offense reaches its full potential \\u2014 and that relies heavily on two second-year tackles improving upon promising rookie seasons \\u2014 and the defense improves greatly with some personnel improvements, why can't the Seahawks compete for an NFC title? They still have to figure out the 49ers, but they won't be intimidated by the rest of the conference if they do so. If this draft class hits like last year's did, the Seahawks could be really good.\\n\\nNightmare scenario\\n\\nGeno Smith wouldn't be the first quarterback to catch lightning in a bottle, then crash hard the following year. Before last season Smith had 34 career touchdowns, 37 interceptions and was six years down the backup QB path of his career. Maybe he's a Rich Gannon, who was very good for multiple seasons late in his career with the Raiders, but it wouldn't shock anyone if he faded back to mediocrity. If that happens the Seahawks could struggle and also look at a fun, young roster and realize that they still have a huge hole at the most important position.\\n\\nThe crystal ball says ...\\n\\nThe Seahawks will be fun. The offense should be explosive. The defense is going to be better. It's a bit of a leap to believe Seattle can take the NFC West from the 49ers, but the NFL is full of surprises every season. Maybe I'm being too optimistic on the Seahawks being much better this season, but I can see them winning the division and maybe a playoff game or two. It's never a bad idea to bet on Pete Carroll's Seahawks exceeding expectations.\\n\\nPrevious previews\\n\\n32. Arizona Cardinals\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n31. Houston Texans\\n\\n30.

Despite losing Wilson, the Seahawks marched back to the playoffs behind the arm of the NFL\\u2019s Comeback Player of the Year.\\n\\nThe Seahawks put their full faith in him this offseason as well, signing him to a new deal and opting not to draft a quarterback early in the 2023 NFL draft. The question now remains: is Smith just a fun story or is he more than just a flash in the pan?\\n\\n10. Deshaun Watson, Cleveland Browns\\n\\nSticking to strictly what has happened on the field for Deshaun Watson, a six-game sample size in an offensive system he has never played in before is not enough to remove a once top-five quarterback (who is still just 27 years old!) from the top-10. It is unreasonable to expect a play-caller to flip his entire offense on his head 12 weeks into the season, but now Stefanski and Watson have a full offseason.\\n\\nWhile he is still listed as a top-10 quarterback here, there are no excuses for Stefanski and Watson to come out firing in 2023.\\n\\n9. Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles\\n\\nI\\u2019ll probably catch heat for having Hurts so low. Good for him for leading his team to a Super Bowl and great for him for getting paid. But there is no doubt the architecture of Shane Steichen\\u2019s offense played a massive role in Hurts\\u2019 success. Can he thrive outside of such a schemed system? If he was not in Philadelphia would he see the same type of success?\\n\\n8. Dak Prescott, Dallas Cowboys\\n\\nUnderrated year after year, Dak Prescott remains one of the smartest quarterbacks in the league who has no problem seeing and spraying the full field. Prescott\\u2019s issues over the last two seasons, however, has been staying on the field. There are reasons to question the direction the Cowboys are going under Mike McCarthy and Brian Schottenheimer, and this could limit the production of Prescott, but he is the best quarterback in the NFC right now.\\n\\n7. Aaron Rodgers, New York Jets\\n\\nHe\\u2019s a walking meme off the field right now, but Rodgers and 4,000 yards passing have been a safe bet to make for the most part over the last decade. Now suiting up for the New York Jets with the skill players to continue to light up the stat sheet, it is on Rodgers to prove he is still an elite quarterback after a down year (which was still quite good).\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Fangraphs.com\", \"author\": \"Dan Szymborski\", \"title\": \"The 2024 ZiPS Projection Gainers: Hitters\", \"description\": \"Dan and ZiPS look at the hitters with the largest positive changes in their 2024 projections this year.\", \"url\": \"https://blogs.fangraphs.com/the-2024-zips-projection-gainers-hitters/\", \"text\": \"The full midseason run of the ZiPS projections have been completed, and while the standings updates are always a lot of fun, they tend to move in a similar direction to our FanGraphs standings, so they\\u2019re usually not the most shocking. What I find the most interesting are the player projections, and not even the numbers for the rest of the season \\u2014 the in-season model is simpler, but improvements in the full model are naturally going to be incremental \\u2014 but the ones that look toward 2024 and beyond.\\n\\nFor today, we\\u2019ll start with the hitters with the largest increases in projected 2024 WAR since my original projections and dig a little into what changed for each player. Sometimes it\\u2019s performance, sometimes it\\u2019s health, sometimes it\\u2019s a change in position. Let\\u2019s jump straight into the names, since I assume everyone reading this knows that ZiPS isn\\u2019t a cheeseburger or a hoodie.\\n\\n1. Matt McLain, Cincinnati Reds\\n\\n2024 WAR: 1.8 preseason, 3.7 midseason (+1.94)\\n\\n2024 wOBA: .323 preseason, .350 midseason (+.027)\\n\\nMcLain was one of the biggest positive outlier picks in the ZiPS Top 100 Prospects, ranking 31st, easily the highest of any source I\\u2019ve found. It\\u2019s not like he didn\\u2019t have credentials, as a two-time first-rounder coming off an .800 OPS in his first full professional season. McLain quickly made ZiPS look good by cranking up the turbo early in 2023, hitting 12 homers in six weeks for Triple-A Louisville and earning a quick promotion. Hitting .299/.364/.505 with no burning questions about his viability at shortstop, he\\u2019s looking nearly as promising early on as another young middle infielder that ZiPS went out on a limb for a decade ago: the 26th-ranked Mookie Betts. (Though don\\u2019t call him the next Mookie quite yet!)\\n\\n2. Elly De La Cruz, Cincinnati Reds\\n\\n2024 WAR: 1.0 preseason, 2.8 midseason (+1.79)\\n\\n2024 wOBA: .310 preseason, .340 midseason (+.030)\\n\\nMcLain may have the edge in the Rookie of the Year voting, but De La Cruz has caught the imagination of the public in a way that his less-flashy teammate hasn\\u2019t. He\\u2019s certainly raised Ell at the plate, slugging nearly .500 in the majors, and his wonderful baserunning aggression shows a real feel for the game and a situational awareness that is rare among even baseball\\u2019s speediest. But he\\u2019s still not quite as polished as McLain, and there are still some skills to be honed: he can be a little too aggressive at the plate at times, his contact rates could use a bit of a bump, and there are still questions as to what position he\\u2019ll end up at long-term. Regardless, De La Cruz is one of the most fun players to watch right now; the Reds knew what they were doing when they gave him Eric Davis\\u2019 number 44.\\n\\n3. Ronald Acu\\u00f1a Jr., Atlanta Braves\\n\\n2024 WAR: 4.5 preseason, 6.0 midseason (+1.50)\\n\\n2024 wOBA: .373 preseason, .393 midseason (+.019)\\n\\nWould Acu\\u00f1a Jr.\\u2019s torn ACL change his trajectory in a negative way? That was the big question for him coming into the 2023 season after a return campaign that most players would love but that was decidedly inferior to his best performances. Now we can say: no. Acu\\u00f1a has been on a tear this year, and if the season ended today, he\\u2019d almost certainly be the NL MVP winner. A 40\\u201340 season is in play, and while he\\u2019s probably off the homer pace this year too much, I don\\u2019t think a 50\\u201350 run is completely implausible sometime over the next couple years.\\n\\n4. Zach Neto, Los Angeles Angels\\n\\n2024 WAR: 0.1 preseason, 1.6 midseason (+1.45)\\n\\n2024 wOBA: .294 preseason, .327 midseason (+.033)\\n\\nZiPS was skeptical about Neto entering the season, but not because of anything necessarily being wrong with him; it stemmed from the simple fact that he had just over a month of professional baseball under his belt. While he was solid in Double-A, which he practically went to straight out of college, it just wasn\\u2019t a lot to go on. It took all of a week of him torturing Triple-A pitchers before the Angels tried to catch lightning in a bottle, and while his performance hasn\\u2019t been phenom-level, he\\u2019s more than held his own against MLB pitching. ZiPS has seen enough that it\\u2019s comfortable thinking of him as a league-average talent in the majors; if this continues, that projection will likely rise quite a bit more before the 2024 season.\\n\\n5. Wander Franco, Tampa Bay Rays\\n\\n2024 WAR: 3.4 preseason, 4.8 midseason (+1.39)\\n\\n2024 wOBA: .342 preseason, .338 midseason (-.004)\\n\\nI\\u2019d hardly call ZiPS a Franco skeptic given that it\\u2019s regularly projected him in the top 10 for rest-of-career WAR. The problem has been health, with a professional high in games played coming into the season of just 110. Playing time and health are useful predictors for future playing time and health, and with Franco healthy this year, ZiPS is a lot more confident that it can project him for a full season. Amusingly, his projected wOBA has actually dropped slightly \\u2014 his zStats are a little more negative than his xStats \\u2014 but by an insignificant margin that\\u2019s notable only because of that negative sign in front of it.\\n\\n6. Masyn Winn, St. Louis Cardinals\\n\\n2024 WAR: 0.2 preseason, 1.5 midseason (+1.35)\\n\\n2024 wOBA: .271 preseason, .282 midseason (+.011)\\n\\nComing into the season, ZiPS saw Winn like Jordan Walker: more as a long-term play than a player who would pay immediate dividends. The defensive projection at the time was rather meh given Winn\\u2019s reputation, but this year, ZiPS has him as +8 runs in a half-season at Triple-A, so there\\u2019s an instant boost there in the projections. The fact that he\\u2019s been able to keep doing what he did offensively at Triple-A this year, at an extremely young age, provides a significant wOBA boost in the projections as well. He just missed the ZiPS Top 100 this year, but he\\u2019ll make it next year unless the Cardinals call him up quickly (or trade him to a team that does).\\n\\n7. Josh Jung, Texas Rangers\\n\\n2024 WAR: 1.3 preseason, 2.6 midseason (+1.34)\\n\\n2024 wOBA: .324 preseason, .337 midseason (+.013)\\n\\nAs with Franco, Jung being healthy \\u2014 in this case after missing half a season with a torn labrum \\u2014 results in a significant increase in the projection. In some ways, this is more a restoration of his pre-2022 projection: .263/.322/.444 for 2.2 WAR in 110 projected games at the time. ZiPS is now fully buying the increased power, and Jung finishing the season with 150 games played would push his 2024 projected WAR over three wins.\\n\\n8. Jake Scheiner, Seattle Mariners\\n\\n2024 WAR: -0.3 preseason, 1.1 midseason (+1.31)\\n\\n2024 wOBA: .290 preseason, .304 midseason (+.014)\\n\\nScheiner is the only player on this list that probably qualifies as a Ken Phelps All-Star, the old Bill James term for veteran players in the high minors that were overlooked. There were a lot more of them in the 1980s, when James coined the phrase; teams are a lot better now at giving talent every opportunity to succeed, and Japan and Korea are more viable places for players who fall through the cracks.\\n\\nScheiner isn\\u2019t literally going to be Ken Phelps, but after belatedly getting promoted to Triple-A Tacoma, he\\u2019s finally enjoying his first really fascinating offensive season in the minors. Sure, it\\u2019s the Pacific Coast League, but Tacoma\\u2019s Cheney Stadium has long been one of the biggest pitchers\\u2019 parks in a notoriously offense-heavy environment. ZiPS doesn\\u2019t think Scheiner is actually good yet, but he\\u2019s done enough that he has his uses as a role player in the majors; if I\\u2019m a team trading with the Mariners this summer, I wouldn\\u2019t mind him as an interesting throw-in.\\n\\n9. Corbin Carroll, Arizona Diamondbacks\\n\\n2024 WAR: 3.9 preseason, 5.1 midseason (+1.28)\\n\\n2024 wOBA: .334 preseason, .360 midseason (+.026)\\n\\nZiPS was all-in on Carroll going into the season, projecting him as the NL Rookie of the Year, its top prospect over Gunnar Henderson, and with a WAR total edging out established outfielders such as Cedric Mullins and Bryan Reynolds. That Carroll has one of the most improved projections for next year despite all this love is testament to how monster a season he\\u2019s having. There are nearly two weeks of July to go, and he\\u2019s almost caught up to his yearly projection already! He\\u2019s a superstar, and the Diamondbacks were right to lock him up at the first opportunity.\\n\\n10. Colt Keith, Detroit Tigers\\n\\n2024 WAR: 0.0 preseason, 1.3 midseason (+1.26)\\n\\n2024 wOBA: .283 preseason, .315 midseason (+.032)\\n\\nI wouldn\\u2019t call ZiPS excited about Keith given its concerns about his defense (about five runs per season below-average at third), but it\\u2019s increasingly interested in his bat thanks to his .977 OPS with Double-A Erie. He\\u2019s since been promoted to the Toledo Mud Hens, and given Detroit\\u2019s offensive woes, it he continues to hit at this level, he\\u2019ll have the Old English D on his cap fairly quickly.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"ESPN\", \"author\": null, \"title\": \"Avs acquire Colton from Lightning for draft pick\", \"description\": \"The Avalanche acquired forward Ross Colton from the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for a second-round pick (37th overall) on Wednesday.\", \"url\": \"https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/37928301/avalanche-acquire-ross-colton-lightning-draft-pick\", \"text\": \"The Colorado Avalanche acquired forward Ross Colton from the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for a second-round pick in Wednesday night's draft.\\n\\nThe Lightning receive the 37th overall pick, part of the package that Colorado acquired in Tuesday's trade that sent forward Alex Newhook to the Montreal Canadiens.\\n\\nColton, 26, tallied 32 points (16 goals, 16 assists) in 81 games with Tampa Bay in 2022-23.

And he even saw some power-play time last season, adding two goals with the man-advantage, as the Devils secured a playoff berth for the first time since 2018.\\n\\nWood was born in Buffalo, New York, where his father, Randy, scored 60 goals in three seasons playing for the Sabres. He played last season on a one-year, $3.2 million contract.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Drouin will be looking for a fresh start with the Avalanche, and he'll have a familiar face nearby to do it with, reuniting with former junior hockey teammate Nathan MacKinnon.\\n\\nThe 28-year-old Drouin has not lived up to his lofty status as a No. 3 overall choice by the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2013, and he finished last season with two goals and 29 points for a Montreal Canadiens team that was playing out the string.\\n\\nSeemingly caught up in a numbers game, and tangled in between several coaching changes in Montreal, Drouin struggled to find a fit in his first six seasons with the Canadiens, who acquired him in a headline-worthy deal in 2017. The Lightning received prospect Mikhail Sergachev, who developed into a defensive anchor for Tampa Bay's title teams, in exchange for Drouin.\\n\\nThe 6-foot left wing scored 18 goals in 2018-19 for Montreal, but failed to reach double digits the next four seasons. His career high -- 21 tallies -- came with Tampa Bay in 2016-17. But goal-scoring potential is at a premium among wingers this free-agent season, and though Drouin has many critics around the league, he figured to attract interest as a second- or third-line option for teams looking for value up front.\\n\\nOne thing he won't bring with him to his new team, is winning pedigree.

Vegas advanced to that stage in the organization's inaugural 2017-18 campaign too (it lost to the Washington Capitals), further proof that while Vegas may have joined the NHL about 100 years into its existence, these Golden Knights wasted no time making their mark.\\n\\nDespite Vegas' short history, the club has undergone a number of roster and coaching changes in a short half-decade that culminated in it hoisting Lord Stanley's chalice. Only six of the Golden Knights' original \\\"Misfits\\\" -- aka the first round of players selected in the 2017 expansion draft -- remained when Vegas clinched its victory: Jonathan Marchessault, William Karlsson, Reilly Smith, Brayden McNabb, Shea Theodore and William Carrier. The club hasn't stopped evolving since its inception.\\n\\nHow did the Golden Knights do it? What had to go wrong before so Vegas could finally get it right? And with one title under its belt, will Vegas go on to repeat with another Cup victory next summer?\\n\\nWe're looking back at Vegas' run to this most recent Cup Final (and its eventual victory) to break down why the Golden Knights will -- and why they won't -- be able to do it all again in 2023-24.\\n\\nIt'll be a fascinating journey to watch. One thing's for sure, though. With Vegas, we know there won't be a dull moment ahead.\\n\\nplay 1:00 Vegas hoists the Stanley Cup for the first time The Vegas Golden Knights celebrate at the Stanley Cup presentation ceremony.\\n\\nThe Golden Knights didn't wander into last season as obvious Cup contenders.\\n\\nVegas missed the playoffs entirely in 2021-22 through repeated, self-inflicted wounds. Their big in-season trade acquisition, Jack Eichel, struggled coming off neck surgery, and by April the tenor of the team was obvious disappointment and frustration over unfulfilled expectations.\\n\\nThat led to then-head coach Peter DeBoer being fired. Bruce Cassidy -- just let go by the Boston Bruins -- stepped in behind the bench. Then word came out in August that the club's starting netminder, Robin Lehner, was likely done for the season following hip surgery.\\n\\nIt felt as though Vegas was at a turning point -- but in which direction? The Golden Knights didn't need long to answer.\\n\\nVegas opened October 2022 with an 8-2-0 record to cement itself as one of the Western Conference's top contenders. And the Golden Knights never let up from there. They finished atop the Western standings with 111 points (51-22-9) and walked right into the postseason off a near-perfect 5-0-2 roll through April.\\n\\nEichel -- fully healthy and back in form -- led the Golden Knights with 27 goals and 66 points through 67 regular-season contents. But Vegas did damage by committee: Seven skaters had 15 or more goals, six surpassed the 60-point plateau and the Golden Knights paced the NHL in blocked shots per 60 minute (17.94), illustrating a ready appetite for bodily sacrifice.\\n\\nAlthough Mark Stone had a hat trick in the Knights' Cup-winning game, Vegas' depth of scoring was a significant strength for the club. Stephen R. Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sports\\n\\nVegas was deservedly confident heading into the playoffs, and it immediately showed the resiliency required of a Cup champion. The Golden Knights lost Game 1 of their first-round playoff series against the Winnipeg Jets by a 5-1 margin, then bounced back with four straight victories to ground the Jets and advance to the second round.\\n\\nThe Edmonton Oilers awaited there, and Vegas split the first two contests. In Game 3, the Golden Knights lost starting goaltender Laurent Brossoit to a playoff-ending groin injury. Vegas turned then to backup Adin Hill, relying on the 27-year-old to backstop the team from there. Hill delivered, and Vegas sent the Oilers packing with a 4-2 series win.\\n\\nIn the Western Conference finals, Vegas faced off against DeBoer and the Dallas Stars. The first two games were overtime wins for the Golden Knights, but the Stars didn't go quietly, pushing the series to an eventual sixth game that Vegas won 6-0 to reach the Cup Final against Florida.\\n\\nThe Panthers' path to that point was more fraught than that of the Golden Knights: Florida had played 16 games by then (including nine rounds of overtime) compared to just 12 games (and five overtimes) for Vegas. The Golden Knights took an early 2-0 lead in the series, and while the Panthers responded with a Game 3 win, it was Vegas punching back with consecutive victories to win the Cup on home ice by a 9-3 result.\\n\\nVegas' season came together through a confluence of factors rooted in a hundred decisions made over the previous six seasons. Cassidy proved to be a perfect fit in the Golden Knights' organization by quickly and effectively establishing an identity for the club. The team as a whole managed to stay relatively healthy in the postseason, and its depth was off the charts (four players hit double-digit goal totals in the postseason; six had 15 or more points).\\n\\nSo what are the chances the Golden Knights can run it back with another title this season? Caesars Sportsbook has given Vegas the second-best odds (behind the Colorado Avalanche) to be the 2023-24 Stanley Cup champion. With the NHL draft and the bulk of free agency behind us, now's the time to take a snapshot of those repeat title chances.\\n\\nPoint: The Golden Knights' core remains intact\\n\\nGeneral manager Kelly McCrimmon and president of hockey operations George McPhee took great pains piecing Vegas together into the team we see now. It'll look quite similar come fall, with those key players from the regular season and postseason returning to the fold.\\n\\nEichel (six goals, 26 points in the playoffs), Mark Stone (11 goals, 24 points), Chandler Stephenson (10 goals, 20 points), Marchessault (13 goals, 25 points) and Karlsson (11 goals, 17 points) remain. So do Theodore, McNabb, Alex Pietrangelo and Alec Martinez on defense. Each has become a cornerstone of Vegas' success to date. Those players set a tone.\\n\\nHill will return too, after his star turn as Vegas' No. 1 goaltender in the playoffs. He was sensational, posting an 11-4-0 record with a .932 save percentage and 2.17 goals-against average. In the Cup Final itself, Hill was 4-1 with a .923 SV%. Vegas smartly resigned Hill via a two-year, $9.8 million contract in June; he'll enter the Golden Knights' training camp on an inside track to be their starter once again.\\n\\nVegas' chemistry was palpable all season long. It was clear how much the Golden Knights enjoyed playing together, and that intangible can't be underestimated when a grinding 82-game campaign bleeds into an increasingly stressful postseason push. No new friends needed.\\n\\nCounterpoint: Health could be an issue\\n\\nColorado learned the hard way.\\n\\nAfter the Avalanche went on their own Cup-winning run in 2021-22, they too hoped to be poised for a repeat. The injury gods had other plans.\\n\\nIn the offseason following the Cup victory, captain Gabriel Landeskog underwent knee surgery and wound up missing the entire 2022-23 season. Cale Makar, Artturi Lehkonen and Nathan MacKinnon -- all integral players on that Cup team -- were sidelined by various ailments. The Avalanche didn't have enough depth to keep up -- they'd lost Nazem Kadri and Andre Burakovsky, among others, to free agency the previous summer -- and Colorado fell short of its consecutive Cup goal.\\n\\nThe Golden Knights will aim to avoid a similar fate. But there's a red flag or two worth watching out for, particularly with impact skaters who've been through the injury roller coaster already.\\n\\nStone himself has had two back surgeries in the past nine months. Eichel has never played a full 82-game season in his eight-year career. Goaltender Logan Thompson missed most of the second half of last season with a lower-body problem. And who knows what other procedures or issues players have been dealing with that we don't know about.\\n\\nIt takes a good deal out of everyone on the path to a Cup victory. How Vegas survives the wear and tear of a long spring -- and short summer -- will have a direct effect on its prospects this year, too.\\n\\nThough Jack Eichel remained healthy through the postseason, he has yet to play a full 82-game season in his career. Lucas Peltier-USA TODAY Sports\\n\\nPoint: Vegas' ownership and management group want to win -- at any cost\\n\\nGolden Knights owner Bill Foley strives to be a man of his word.\\n\\nHe's off to a good start.\\n\\nFoley recounted for reporters last month how, when Karlsson agreed to an eight-year extension with Vegas in June 2019, he expected \\\"three Stanley Cups\\\" during the length of the contract.\\n\\n\\\"When we were on the ice [after the Cup victory] and getting our pictures taken,\\\" Foley said, \\\"I looked over at [Karlsson] and told him, 'OK, you got one.'\\\"\\n\\nVegas has four years -- on Foley's timeline anyway -- to grab two more. And there's no doubt Foley will give his executives every green light available to try and get there. McPhee and McCrimmon have a history of showing they'll take advantage of opportunity.\\n\\nMcCrimmon has said repeatedly that while Vegas' run to the Cup Final in its inaugural season wasn't a fluke, the organization had to improve season over season to be where it's at now, positioned as a perennial contender.\\n\\nTo make that a reality, the Golden Knights aren't afraid to make hard -- or unpopular -- decisions. Last month Vegas traded Smith, an original Golden Knight, to Pittsburgh to free up enough cap space to sign Ivan Barbashev to a five-year, $25 million extension. Vegas previously acquired Barbashev from St. Louis at the trade deadline, and he was a force in the postseason, putting up seven goals and 18 points (Smith, by comparison, tallied four goals and 14 points).\\n\\nMcCrimmon & Co. don't get bogged down by emotion. Smith was the first player to whom Stone handed the Cup after his initial captain's lap, but moving him freed up cap space and got Vegas a third-round draft pick in return.\\n\\nCounterpoint: Cap space could be an issue\\n\\nAt the moment, Vegas has $1,423,317 in cap space, according to Cap Friendly.\\n\\nNow, that could change if and when the team shifts players to long-term injured reserve down the road (for example, Lehner spent all of this past year on LTIR with a hip issue, and his $5 million hit might end up there again depending on his current health status).\\n\\nLike some other teams, the Golden Knights have gotten creative in the recent past in hurdling over any cap-related restraints. If there's a loophole they can use to sign or keep a player, they will explore it in earnest.\\n\\nHowever, the cap is what it is -- and it's increasing by a paltry $1 million this season (to hit $83.5 million). Should the Golden Knights not be able to capitalize on LTIR space like they have in the past, it could tie their hands when it comes to making in-season improvements. Having the team's core dialed in is the ideal scenario, but as the Avalanche discovered, there must be room to adjust on the fly as well -- or else.\\n\\nRobin Lehner hasn't played in a game since April 20, 2022. Getty Images\\n\\nReality: It's hard -- but not impossible -- to repeat\\n\\nJust 16 NHL teams have won consecutive championships. Only Tampa Bay (in 2020 and 2021) and Pittsburgh (2016 and 2017) have managed to do it in the past 25 years.\\n\\nThere's a long list of reasons for why that feat is so difficult. Fatigue plays a major role for many Cup-winning teams the following season. The league's other 31 teams have had the chance to improve themselves over the past months and weeks, too. There's a target on the back of champions. That can creep into any player's head space and take hold -- positively or negatively.\\n\\nThe mere pressure of attempting to repeat can derail that very attempt. It's a collection of issues every former victor has had to navigate, and the vast majority fall short.\\n\\nThat's not to say Vegas can't be the exception. All things being equal, the Golden Knights should have a strong, motivated team going into the season. And Vegas has enjoyed defying the odds, whether in that first-season push to the Cup Final or by their willingness to take risks that ultimately paid off.\\n\\nWhat's the final verdict, then, on Vegas' potential going 2-for-2? It's easy to be high on its chances in July. On paper, the Golden Knights are obvious contenders you'd be hard-pressed to bet against.\\n\\nBut as every card player knows too well -- tables can go from hot to cold in a blink.

It\\u2019s not my call, but obviously, it\\u2019s disappointing to see,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nMcDavid\\u2019s statement comes after Tampa Bay Lightning captain Steven Stamkos said that a majority of the players enjoyed wearing the jerseys.\\n\\n\\u201cIt was 98 percent or 99 percent of other players that wore the jersey and enjoyed wearing it and were proud wearing it \\u2014 whatever jersey it was \\u2014 whether it was the Pride, the military night, the cancer nights,\\u201d Stamkos said. \\u201cThe story shouldn\\u2019t be about the guy that didn\\u2019t wear it \\u2014 the one guy or the two guys.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI understand that\\u2019s what gets the clicks and that\\u2019s what gets the views, but the word \\u2018distraction\\u2019 gets thrown around. I don\\u2019t think it had to have been a distraction. It could have been a non-issue while focusing on the good that was coming out of those nights,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nNHL Pride Nights became a hot topic of conversation earlier this year when Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Ivan Provorov refused to participate in his team\\u2019s Pride Night due to his orthodox Christian faith, sparking outrage from leftists who proceeded to accuse him of bigotry and homophobia. However, the Philadelphia Flyers kept him in the lineup, and the team even went on to win the game against the Anaheim Ducks.\\n\\n\\u201cI respect everybody, and I respect everybody\\u2019s choices,\\u201d he said after the game. \\u201cMy choice is to stay true to myself and my religion. That\\u2019s all I\\u2019m going to say.\\u201d\\n\\nLater, the San Jose Sharks goaltender James Reimer chose not to wear a pride-themed warm-up jersey in a recent game, citing his Christian faith.\\n\\n\\u201cFor all 13 years of my NHL career, I have been a Christian \\u2014 not just in title, but in how I choose to live my life daily. I have a personal faith in Jesus Christ who died on the cross for my sins and, in response, asks me to love everyone and follow him,\\u201d he said.\\n\\n\\u201cI have no hate in my heart for anyone, and I have always strived to treat everyone that I encounter with respect and kindness. In this specific instance, I am choosing not to endorse something that is counter to my personal convictions which are based on the Bible, the highest authority in my life,\\u201d he added.\\n\\nAs Breitbart News reported last week, the NHL Board of Governors agreed with Commissioner Gary Bettman that the numerous refusals from certain teammates to wear Pride jerseys were a distraction.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s just become more of a distraction from really the essence of what the purpose of these nights are,\\u201d Bettman said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re keeping the focus on the game. And on these specialty nights, we\\u2019re going to be focused on the cause.\\u201d\\n\\nTeams will still celebrate some form of Pride night as well as other themed nights. Teams will also still design rainbow Pride jerseys for sale to raise money.\\n\\nYou Can Play, which has worked with sports leagues on LGBTQ outreach, admitted feeling \\u201cconcerned and disappointed\\u201d by the decision.\\n\\n\\u201cToday\\u2019s decision means that the over 95% of players who chose to wear a Pride jersey to support the community will now not get an opportunity to do so,\\u201d the organization said. \\u201cThe work to make locker rooms, board rooms and arenas safer, more diverse, and more inclusive needs to be ongoing and purposeful, and we will continue to work with our partners at the NHL, including individual teams, players, agents and the NHLPA to ensure this critical work continues.\\u201d\\n\\nPaul Roland Bois joined Breitbart News in 2021.

In April of Mitchell\\u2019s freshman year, three of his friends from home, all members of the Humboldt Broncos junior hockey team, were among 16 on the team bus to die following a horrific highway accident in Saskatchewan.\\n\\nOnly 19 at the time, Mitchell lost his closest pal, right wing Logan Hunter, along with left wing Conner Lukan and goalie Parker Tobin.\\n\\n\\u201cAll of us from Alberta . . . and all grew up kind of playing together,\\u201d Mitchell recalled recently. \\u201cJust a terrible event.\\u201d\\n\\nIn order to help Mitchell deal with his grief, Montgomery and his wife, Emily, welcomed him into their home. It served to underscore Mitchell\\u2019s belief that Montgomery cared as much about his players as people as he did their being part of the team.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\u201cRight after the crash happened, he invited me over to his house to stay there for a few days, just to get me out of the dorms and be around family,\\u201d Mitchell said. \\u201cI\\u2019ll never forget what that scene was like, and what he did for me in a very difficult time in my life. Off the ice . . . his support of me has been immeasurable.\\u201d\\n\\nMontgomery, the NHL\\u2019s coach of the year for 2022-23, was aware that the front office had Mitchell on their radar in the days leading up to the Hall trade.\\n\\n\\u201cI gave [general manager Don Sweeney] my thoughts,\\u201d said Montgomery. \\u201cI told him, \\u2018Yeah, I\\u2019d like to work with [Mitchell] again.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n\\nMontgomery\\u2019s thumbnail profile of Mitchell: \\u201cA high-character person, high hockey sense, high compete, and a real good skater . . . he\\u2019s going to fit in well with the Bruins culture. A smart, skilled defenseman who moves the puck really well. It might take him a while. I don\\u2019t know how long before he gets to Boston, but he\\u2019s going to be a good one for us.\\u201d\\n\\nDrafted 57th overall in 2017, Mitchell played three seasons with the Pioneers before turning pro in the spring of 2020. He spent most of his first pro season on the varsity blue line, played sparingly his second season, then was back in Chicago full time last season, though was hindered by a wrist injury for the first two months. Coached by Luke Richardson, Mitchell spent most of his time at five-on-five and helped on the power play.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhen training camp opens in Brighton on Sept. 20, Mitchell will be vying for time on the No. 3 defense pairing, which currently projects to have Derek Forbort on the left and veteran free agent pickup Kevin Shattenkirk on the right. Others in the mix include Jakub Zboril, Alec Regula (obtained in the same trade as Mitchell) and possibly ex-Harvard standout Reilly Walsh (acquired from New Jersey). No shortage of candidates.\\n\\nMitchell, 5 foot 11 inches and 193 pounds, figures his skating and puck-moving skills are his calling card. He trains summers in Denver, joined there by Bruin Brandon Carlo and other NHLers, including Denver alums Troy Terry, Scott Mayfield, and Will Butcher. He plans to pack up at the start of September for the move to Boston.\\n\\n\\u201cEveryone tells me I\\u2019m going to love it,\\u201d Mitchell said, his prior visits here only brief. \\u201cI\\u2019m excited to get going.\\u201d\\n\\nWAITING TO BE HEARD\\n\\nSwayman, Frederic slated for arbitration\\n\\nJeremy Swayman and the Bruins look headed for arbitration. Barry Chin/Globe Staff\\n\\nUnless there\\u2019s a negotiated meeting of the minds in the next few days, Jeremy Swayman and the Bruins will enter the salary arbitration meat grinder July 29, followed by Trent Frederic\\u2019s hearing Aug. 1.\\n\\nGM Don Sweeney, with some $5.4 million remaining in cap space, will have to rearrange the roster slightly if both players go through the process and are awarded paydays in excess of that number. Given the historical landscape across the league, odds favor a negotiated settlement in the hours leading up to both hearings.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the Jets and Gabriel Vilardi, one of the key assets acquired in the Pierre-Luc Dubois trade with the Kings, avoided their hearing and settled on a two-year deal at $3.44 million annually, a four-fold bump for Vilardi, 23, who wrangled a meager $825,000 out of the Kings for last season after terming out of his entry-level contract.\\n\\nThe Golden Knights and arbitration-bound Brett Howden also settled Wednesday, negotiating a two-year pact that carries a $1.9 million cap hit. Vegas still has some slimming down to do, Howden\\u2019s deal leaving the team $4.15 million over the cap, even after moving Reilly Smith\\u2019s $5 million off the books last month for a Penguins third-round draft pick in 2024.\\n\\nMaple Leafs goalie Ilya Samsonov, with slightly more experience than Swayman (131 games vs. 88), entered arbitration Friday in search of $4.9 million, slightly more than double the $2.4 million the Leafs offered.\\n\\nA comparable spread for Swayman would be, say, $2 million-$4 million, the middle ground of which would be ideal from the Bruins\\u2019 perspective. It would set them up for the coming season with Swayman and partner Linus Ullmark, the returning Vezina winner, making a combined $8 million \\u2014 slightly less than 10 percent of the cap ceiling ($83.5 million) to cover the most important position.\\n\\nFrederic, with 198 games and 54 points, has termed out of his second contract after making $1.15 million last season. There is no all-things-being-equal equation in all of this, but something approaching Howden\\u2019s $1.9 million would seem a decent payday for Frederic, who was chosen two picks after Howden in the first round of the 2016 draft.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHowden, a Tampa Bay draft pick, has delivered .294 points per game at the NHL level, while Frederic has popped for .273.\\n\\nETC.\\n\\nCanadiens\\u2019 pick not a welcome surprise\\n\\nThe Canadiens selection of David Reinbacher wasn't a popular one with the fans. Bruce Bennett/Getty\\n\\nThey\\u2019re restless in Montreal. That\\u2019s not news, not after what is now a 30-year Cup drought for the Canadiens. Remember, Les Glorieux won it five times in their first 30 years, and rattled off a record five straight (1956-60) in what Habs fans considered normal times.\\n\\nThe reaction of the fan base was exceptionally nasty after last month\\u2019s decision by Jeff Gorton, Kent Hughes, et al, to use the fifth pick in the draft on David Reinbacher, a 6-foot-2-inch Austrian-born defenseman out of Switzerland\\u2019s top pro league. Let it not be overlooked that the kid literally has CH in his name.\\n\\nThe reaction: David who?!\\n\\nActually, it was more emotional than that, but we\\u2019re going by old-school Sunday newspaper rules. Habs fans had their minds set on the far more hyped Matvei Michkov, the Russian right winger who some believe could be the next Kirill Kaprizov (a fifth-round choice in 2015 by the Wild).\\n\\nMichkov, who might not be able to break his contract in Russia for at least two more years, went No. 7 to the Flyers.\\n\\nReinbacher, with the size (6-2/185) and game that encouraged the Bruins to select Charlie McAvoy at No. 14 in 2016, got lambasted by Habs fans on social media, in part because he\\u2019s unknown, in part because he\\u2019s not Michkov, in part because of the aforementioned 30-year drought.\\n\\nEvery draft, unless it\\u2019s Connor McDavid at No. 1 to Edmonton in 2015 or even Connor Bedard at No. 1 to Chicago this year, places fans in a position of faith \\u2014 the trust that a club\\u2019s infrastructure of talent assessment knows what it\\u2019s doing.\\n\\nFaith and trust are low in Montreal, albeit only a year removed from the Canadiens delighting most everyone up there by using the No. 1 pick to select Juraj Slafkovsk\\u00fd, the highly touted Slovak left wing. As a rookie, Slafkovsk\\u00fd proved that like most 18-year-olds, he\\u2019ll need time for his game to grow into its promise. He finished a modest 4-6\\u201310 in 39 games, his season coming to an end in mid-January because of a lower-body injury.\\n\\nNick Bobrov, the former Bruins scout who is now co-director of amateur scouting for the Canadiens, reminded one and all in Nashville that it\\u2019s \\u201cnot a trivial matter\\u201d that the Canadiens are trying to create and build a team culture \\u2014 one they feel Reinbacher fits.\\n\\n\\u201cWe all watch the playoffs,\\u201d Bobrov added, \\u201cand for two months of the year we get reminded of what works and what wins [and] maybe we tend to forget that for 10 months.\\u201d\\n\\nUnlike McAvoy, Reinbacher\\u2019s draft profile was low, to the point of being barely existent last summer. But it began to lift during his performance in the World Junior Championships last summer in Edmonton and throughout his second season playing for Kloten in the Swiss League. All things considered, the Canadiens felt Reinbacher was the best defenseman available.\\n\\nTry not to \\u201cget caught up in shiny objects, I guess,\\u201d Bobrov recently told The Athletic, explaining the Canadiens\\u2019 decision-making process.\\n\\nPrior to heading home for the summer, Reinbacher signed his entry-level contract, worth $6.35 million if he\\u2019s on Montreal\\u2019s roster for three full seasons. Like Leo Carlsson, the Swedish center who recently signed after being selected No. 2 by Anaheim, Reinbacher could play in North America for the coming season or remain in Europe.\\n\\nFree agency not a big boon\\n\\nTyler Bertuzzi didn't find the free agent market he expected. Michael Dwyer/Associated Press\\n\\nForwards Tomas Nosek and Tyler Bertuzzi played much different roles in the Bruins\\u2019 offense, and now both have moved on to new clubs for prices that have left some Black-and-Gold fans scratching their heads.\\n\\nNo need to scratch: In both cases, market forces in free agency played out much differently than either player expected.\\n\\nPrior to prices sagging, especially at the top end of the market where Bertuzzi rightfully was shopping, Don Sweeney was in a position of having to secure bona fide NHL talent for the Bruins amid the annual mad merry-go-round July 1.\\n\\nWe can argue over what the likes of oldsters James van Riemsdyk, Milan Lucic, and Kevin Shattenkirk will offer. But while Bertuzzi and Nosek were shopping with deep pockets wide open, Sweeney opted to fill roster spots with guys willing to take huge late-career financial haircuts. Otherwise, he risked having to fill the lineup with kids who could have proven not quite ready for prime time.\\n\\nImagine the head scratching among the fan base if the record at the Christmas break read something like 11-19-2? Bad in normal times, but what about after a record-setting 65-12-5 campaign?\\n\\nNosek, who played here the last two seasons for a $1.75 million cap hit, on Wednesday finally grabbed what he could, a one-year, $1 million deal with the Devils. In a more typical market (perhaps to return next season?), the trusty Nosek, even as a fourth-liner, reasonably could have expected a modest bump of $500K, or perhaps a total of $5 million over two years.\\n\\nA frustrated Bertuzzi, wise enough to spot where the market was headed, opted for a one-year deal with the Leafs July 2. Price: $5.5M, or less than a 20 percent hike over the $4.75 million cap hit he came to Boston with from Detroit \\u2014 a deal he negotiated as a restricted free agent. Bertuzzi, remember, tied Brad Marchand (10) as points leader for the Bruins\\u2019 all-too-brief playoff run in April.\\n\\nNo big secret to winning\\n\\nWhat was the secret sauce that led the Golden Knights to the franchise\\u2019s first Stanley Cup title?\\n\\n\\u201cAh, boy, tough question,\\u2019 said their coach, Bruce Cassisdy, the former Bruins bench boss, back on Cape Cod for the summer. \\u201cBecause I thought we had good Bruins teams \\u2014 and I\\u2019m sure they thought they had the best chance to win this year. I think it\\u2019s just elevating your game at the right time.\\u201d\\n\\nFor the Golden Knights, added Cassidy, timely goals across the lineup, along with timely saves, made the difference.\\n\\n\\u201cWe were able to make the difference \\u2014 making plays when we had to,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSome games I think we were just flat-out better than the other team, and other games we lost that we didn\\u2019t deserve to win. But in important games, we just made the play. And it wasn\\u2019t one guy \\u2014 it was [Jonathan] Marchessault, Jack Eichel, [Ivan] Barbashev, [Chandler] Stephenson, [Mark] Stone, [Brett Howden], [Michael] Amadio scores in double OT. So I think you need stories like that, where everyone\\u2019s pitching in.\\u201d\\n\\nBy and large, the roster grew healthier as the postseason extended, contrary to standard playoff attrition. One exception was in net, where Adin Hill (11-4) picked up for an injured Laurent Brossoit (5-2). The Knights bucked conventional wisdom, essentially winning the Cup on the shoulders of two goalies who entered the postseason as career backups with no playoff experience.\\n\\n\\u201cThat conversation\\u2019s going to start changing here soon,\\u201d predicted Cassidy. \\u201cColorado won with [Darcy] Kuemper and used their other guy [Pavel Francouz] along the way, too, so maybe it\\u2019s not like you need your Patrick Roy and Marty Brodeur from years ago, where they\\u2019re going to carry the team. Yes, you need good goaltending, but I think general managers are looking at that and maybe you won\\u2019t see the big deals for the goalies like maybe you did years ago.\\u201d\\n\\nLoose pucks\\n\\nFor the 11th year running, the Bruins will dispatch their rookies to Buffalo for the Prospects Challenge, this year with Montreal, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, and New Jersey in the September mixer. The WannaB\\u2019s open against the Penguins on Sept. 15, face the Canadiens on Sept. 16, then close it out Sept. 18 against the Devils. Varsity camp then opens two days later in Brighton . . . The 2003 draft that delivered Patrice Bergeron at No., 45 to the Bruins, also brought them Alaska-born Nate Thompson at No. 183. Thompson, who played last season for AHL Ontario, called it a career Thursday after 844 NHL games, four of those with the Bruins. His sweater collection also includes the Islanders, Lightning, Ducks, Senators, Kings, Canadiens, Flyers, and Jets . . . Ross Colton, ex- of the University of Vermont and the Lightning, signed a four-year extension with the Avalanche with a $4 million cap hit \\u2014 big leap over the $1.125 million he made with Tampa Bay. Technically, that put the Avalanche well over the cap, but with Gabriel Landeskog ($7 million cap hit) expected hors de combat for the season, Colorado should fit comfortably under the $83.5 million threshold . . .

Still, there were plenty of players that could help NHL franchises improve heading towards the 2023-24 campaign.\\n\\nSome of the biggest names included Tyler Bertuzzi, Ryan O'Reilly, Matt Duchene and Dmitri Orlov. With most of the top free agents having signed deals with their new teams, let's take a look at some of the biggest winners and losers of NHL free agency.\\n\\nIt's hard to argue that there's a team more improved than the Carolina Hurricanes. Coming off a spirited run to the Eastern Conference Final despite being undermanned, Hurricanes general manager Don Waddell had the burner cranked all the way up on the stove.\\n\\nCarolina improved their blue line in a big way as they signed Orlov, who was one of the top free agents on the market, to a two-year, $16 million deal after he turned in a career year in which he registered 36 points (7 goals, 29 assists) splitting time between the Boston Bruins and Washington Capitals. Orlov gives the Hurricanes a top-pairing type of a defenseman that could skate with offensive-minded Brent Burns next season.\\n\\nThe Hurricanes also signed former Toronto Maple Leafs winger Michael Bunting to a three-year, $13.5 million contract. Bunting has scored 46 goals over the past two seasons and gives Carolina a huge boost to their top-six forwards. In addition, the Hurricanes decided to run it back in net, as they signed veteran goaltenders Frederik Andersen and Antti Raanta to short-term deals. It may have come as a little bit of surprise with young netminder Pyotr Kochetkov waiting in the wings, but Andersen and Raanta have a veteran presence that a team chasing a Stanley Cup can utilize.\\n\\nLoser: Boston Bruins\\n\\nThe Boston Bruins are coming off the single greatest regular season in NHL history with 135 points and 65 wins to their credit. Still, the Bruins ended up being eliminated by the Florida Panthers in the opening round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs after squandering a 3-1 lead.\\n\\nIn the early stages of free agency, the Bruins signed veterans James van Riemsdyk, Milan Lucic and Kevin Shattenkirk, as well as former Seattle Kraken forward Morgan Geekie. These moves are fine for a contending team that already has a stacked roster in place, but the Bruins failed to bring back Tyler Bertuzzi or Orlov, who they acquired at the 2023 trade deadline.\\n\\nThe Bruins do have depth on the blue line, so not retaining Orlov at an $8 million annual price tag is understandable to an extent. However, letting Bertuzzi walk in free agency is a gamble. His versatility on the wing had been a terrific fit in Boston, so it was a little surprising to see them make little effort to retain his services.\\n\\nWinner: Toronto Maple Leafs\\n\\nFree agency didn't get off to the most stellar start for the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday. Just minutes into free agency, they lost veteran forward Ryan O'Reilly to the Nashville Predators. The Hurricanes also signed Bunting away from the Maple Leafs, so things were looking bleak.\\n\\nBut on Sunday, the Maple Leafs' fortunes changed in a big way. The team landed Bertuzzi on a one-year, $5.5 million deal -- one of the biggest prizes in free agency. The Maple Leafs also signed forward Max Domi to a one-year, $3 million contract. After losing Bunting and O'Reilly, Toronto acted swiftly in order to replace them, and did so with two of the top forwards remaining on the market.\\n\\nThe Maple Leafs then added defenseman John Klingberg on a one-year, $4.15 million contract. Klingberg isn't exactly a defensive stalwart, but his offensive prowess could be a welcome addition to Toronto's blue line.\\n\\nAfter appearing in the Stanley Cup Final in three consecutive seasons, that streak came to an end for the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Lightning fell at the hands of the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round of the postseason.\\n\\nMuch like the 2022 offseason, the Lightning were forced to make some tough financial decisions. Tampa Bay ended up trading forward Ross Colton to the Colorado Avalanche for draft pick compensation, as well as seeing forward Alex Killorn sign with the Anaheim Ducks. With very little financial space to spare, the Lightning signed forwards Conor Sheary and Luke Glendening to cap-friendly deals.\\n\\nFor the second consecutive offseason, the Lightning lost a key forward after they weren't able to re-sign Ondrej Palat in 2022. Dynasties eventually get older and just aren't able to retain everybody that made those championships possible. That is likely whar we're witnessing with the Lightning.\\n\\nWinner: Colorado Avalanche\\n\\nThe Colorado Avalanche were hampered by injuries throughout the 2022-23 season. Being a healthier team next season, combined with some solid signing in free agency, will help the Avalanche achieve that feat.\\n\\nGeneral manager Joe Sakic inked former New Jersey Devils winger Miles Wood to a six-year deal at just $2.5 million AAV to give the Avalanche some scoring depth. Colorado wasn't done, as the team signed Jonathan Drouin to a one-year, $825,000 deal in the hopes of reviving his career.\\n\\nThe Avalanche also signed defenseman Bowen Byram, who was a restricted free agent, to a two-year, $3.85 million contract extension. Byram produced a career year in which he registered 24 points (10 goals, 14 assists) in just 42 games. Prior to free agency beginning, Sakic also brought veteran center Ryan Johansen to Colorado for the rights to Alex Galchenyuk, and the Nashville Predators retained 50 percent of Johansen's salary in that deal.\\n\\nThe Avalanche have plenty of star power in the form of Natahn MacKinnon, Cale Makar and Mikko Rantanen, but bringing in depth pieces like Wood, Drouin, and Johansen were sound moves that championship squads make.\\n\\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins had an impressive start to the offseason when they brought in Kyle Dubas as the team's new president. However, he made one very questionable move as free agency got underway over the weekend.\\n\\nEntering free agency, it appeared as though the Penguins were looking to make a change in net. Goaltender Tristan Jarry looked to be on his way out, but Pittsburgh ended up re-signing the veteran goalie to a five-year, $26.857 million contract. Jarry's new deal will carry a $5.375 million annual cap hit, despite him being injured often and having a 3.00 career goals-against-average in the postseason.\\n\\nThe Penguins also added former Devils defenseman Ryan Graves to a six-year, $27 million contract to help stabilize the blue line. It's a decent move, but that Jarry deal may end up being a huge eyesore. It would've made more sense for the Penguins to kick the tires on a potential trade for Winnipeg Jets netminder Connor Hellebuyck or Anaheim Ducks goalie John Gibson rather than settling on a known commodity.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"CBS Sports\", \"author\": \"Austin Nivison\", \"title\": \"NHL Draft 2023: Looking back at the star-studded 2003 draft class, 20 years later\", \"description\": \"The 2003 NHL Draft in Nashville produced more than two dozen All-Stars\", \"url\": \"https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/nhl-draft-2023-looking-back-at-the-star-studded-2003-draft-class-20-years-later/\", \"text\": \"The 2023 NHL Draft in Nashville marks the 20th anniversary of the greatest draft of all-time, which was held in the very same city. The 2003 draft produced countless legends and a handful of future Hall of Famers.\\n\\nThe 2003 draft class started out well, with Marc-Andre Fleury and Eric Staal as the top two picks, but future NHL All-Stars were taken as late as the second-to-last pick. In total, a whopping 27 future All-Stars heard their names called 20 years ago in Nashville.\\n\\nKeep in mind that number doesn't even include players like Nathan Horton, Braydon Coburn, Eric Fehr, Mark Stuart, Patrick Eaves, Kevin Klein and Matt Carle. All of them had long and successful careers, but were never named to an All-Star Game.\\n\\nNot only did the 2003 draft class boast starpower, but it also boasted longevity, with 11 of them playing in the 2022-23 season. NHL-caliber talent littered this draft class, and it may be a long time before we see another one like it.\\n\\nLet's take a look back at the 27 All-Stars that the 2003 NHL Draft produced and see how their careers played out.\\n\\nMarc-Andre Fleury | G\\n\\nPick: No. 1 overall\\n\\nTeam: Pittsburgh Penguins\\n\\nAll-Star: 2011, 2015, 2018-2019\\n\\nThis was the last time a goalie was the No. 1 overall pick, and it worked out pretty well for the Penguins. It took a few years for Fleury to get his footing in the NHL, but he broke out in 2007-08, when he posted a .921 save percentage and 2.33 GAA in 35 games. That was the start of a long run of success for Fleury.\\n\\nIn the 2008-09 season, Fleury helped lead the Penguins to their first Stanley Cup since 1992, and he won two more rings in Pittsburgh before the Vegas Golden Knights selected him in the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft. The following season, Fleury was terrific for Vegas as he powered them to the Stanley Cup Final in their inaugural season. Three years later, he won the 2021 Vezina Trophy with a 1.98 GAA and a .928 save percentage.\\n\\nSince then, Fleury made a brief stop in Chicago, and he has one more year left on his current contract with the Minnesota Wild. That will give him the chance to build upon his impressive career numbers that include 544 wins, 73 shutouts, and a .913 save percentage.\\n\\nEric Staal | C\\n\\nPick: No. 2 overall\\n\\nTeam: Carolina Hurricanes\\n\\nAll-Star: 2007-2009, 2011, 2018, 2020\\n\\nAs a rookie in 2003-04, Staal tallied a modest 11 goals and 20 assists. That's a solid - but not spectacular - rookie campaign. Staal took his game to an elite level in his second year with the Hurricanes.\\n\\nThat season, he scored 45 goals en route to totaling 100 points, winning the Stanley Cup, and finishing fourth in Hart Trophy voting. Staal was a star for Carolina in that playoff run, and his 28 points led all players in the postseason.\\n\\nStaal spent the first 12 seasons of his career with the Hurricanes, and he notched 775 points in 909 games with the franchise. Since the Hurricanes traded him to the Rangers midway through the 2015-16 season, Staal has played for five different teams, spending four years with the Minnesota Wild from 2016 to 2020. Staal just recently completed the third Stanley Cup Final of his career with the Florida Panthers.\\n\\nThomas Vanek | LW\\n\\nPick: No. 5 overall\\n\\nTeam: Buffalo Sabres\\n\\nAll-Star: 2009\\n\\nScoring goals is pretty important in hockey, and Thomas Vanek was pretty good at that. Vanek scored at least 20 goals in each of his first 10 NHL seasons, and he was a lethal power play weapon for most of his 14-year career.\\n\\nVanek scored 25 goals in his rookie season with the Sabres, and he increased that total to 43 goals in the 2006-07 campaign. From the start of the 2005-06 season through the 2013-14 season, Vanek scored a total of 277 goals. That ranked eighth in that time frame and put Vanek ahead of players like Marian Hossa, Martin St. Louis, Vincent Lecavalier, and Daniel Sedin.\\n\\nVanek was traded twice during that 2013-14 season, and he spent the rest of his career as a hired gun, going to any team that needed some depth scoring. Vanek spent his final NHL season with the Detroit Red Wings in 2018-19, and he ended his career with 373 goals in 1,029 games.\\n\\nMilan Michalek | LW\\n\\nPick: No. 6 overall\\n\\nTeam: San Jose Sharks\\n\\nAll-Star: 2012\\n\\nMichalek scored in his first NHL game with the San Jose Sharks, but he tore his ACL early in his second career game. That forced Michalek to miss the rest of the 2003-04 season, but he rebounded with 17 goals and 18 assists in the first season after the 2004-05 lockout.\\n\\nIn each of his next four seasons, including his first after being traded to the Ottawa Senators in 2009-10, Michalek eclipsed the 20-goal mark. After being limited to 66 games and 18 goals in 2010-11, Michalek exploded for 35 goals and 60 points in 2011-12, the best season of his career. He was named to the All-Star Game, but Michalek wouldn't reach that level again.\\n\\nIn 2016, Michalek was dealt to the Toronto Maple Leafs, and he played a total of 18 games for the franchise before ending his NHL career in 2017.\\n\\nRyan Suter | D\\n\\nPick: No. 7 overall\\n\\nTeam: Nashville Predators\\n\\nAll-Star: 2012, 2015, 2017\\n\\nSuter didn't play his first NHL game until the 2005-06 season, but has spent nearly two decades as a staple on blue lines ever since. The following season, Suter broke out for eight goals and 16 assists as he became one of the best defensive players for Nashville.\\n\\nThat is how things would remain through the 2011-12 season. Suter picked up some Norris Trophy votes on an annual basis while playing at an elite level. In 2010-11, Suter played an integral role in getting the Predators past the first round of the playoffs for the first time, and he did the same thing the following season when they defeated the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2012, Suter signed a massive 13-year, $98 million contract with the Minnesota Wild. He played the next nine seasons as a top-pairing defenseman with the Wild before the team bought him out following the 2020-21 campaign. For the past two seasons, Suter has played for the Dallas Stars, and he still has two years remaining on his contract.\\n\\nIn 1,362 career games, Suter has tallied 103 goals, 561 assists, and 664 points. At this point, his case for the Hall of Fame has been all but solidified.\\n\\nDion Phaneuf | D\\n\\nPick: No. 9 overall\\n\\nTeam: Calgary Flames\\n\\nAll-Star: 2007-2008, 2012\\n\\nThe 6-foot-4 Phaneuf was a highly-touted defensive prospect who had the size and scoring touch to play in the NHL. Early in his career with the Calgary Flames, things went according to plan for Phaneuf.\\n\\nAs a rookie in 2005-06, Phaneuf scored 20 goals and totaled 49 points. He earned first-team All-Rookie honors and finished third in Calder Trophy voting. Two seasons later, Phaneuf put up 60 points and a whopping 182 penalty minutes in 82 games, and he was the Norris Trophy runner-up to Nicklas Lidstrom in 2008.\\n\\nThe Flames traded Phaneuf to the Maple Leafs in January of 2010 as part of a blockbuster deal. Phaneuf played parts of seven seasons in Toronto, but the team only reached the postseason once in that time.\\n\\nThe Leafs traded Phaneuf the Ottawa Senators in 2016, and he was part of the team that went to the Eastern Conference Final in 2017. After spending two years with the Los Angeles Kings from 2017 to 2019, Phaneuf officially announced his retirement in 2021. He tallied 137 goals and 357 assists in 1,048 career games.\\n\\nJeff Carter | C\\n\\nPick: No. 11 overall\\n\\nTeam: Philadelphia Flyers\\n\\nAll-Star: 2009, 2017\\n\\nWith Carter, we kick off a run of players with multiple Stanley Cup victories to their name. In 2005-06, Carter kicked off what would become a spectacular career with 23 goals and 42 points in 81 games. In his six seasons with the Flyers, Carter scored 181 goals, which ranked 17th in that time.\\n\\nIn 2010, Carter was injured for a portion of the Flyers' Stanley Cup Final run, but he still scored five goals in 12 games.\\n\\nThe Flyers traded Carter to the Columbus Blue Jackets in June of 2011, but he didn't stay there for long. The Jackets sent him to the Los Angeles Kings before the 2012 trade deadline, and he instantly became a key piece of their Stanley Cup team. Carter was tied for the league lead in playoff goals, along with teammates Dustin Brown and Anze Kopitar, as L.A. won its first Cup in franchise history.\\n\\nTwo years later, Carter helped lead the Kings to another Stanley Cup with 10 goals and 25 points in 26 playoff games. Carter went on to spend a decade with the Kings, and he scored 194 goals in 580 games.\\n\\nCarter's tenure with the Kings ended when he was traded to the Penguins in 2021, and he has one year left on his contract there.\\n\\nDustin Brown | RW\\n\\nPick: No. 13 overall\\n\\nTeam: Los Angeles Kings\\n\\nAll-Star: 2009\\n\\nCarter's teammate on those Cup-winning teams, Dustin Brown, was selected just two picks after him in the 2003 draft. Brown, a star for the OHL's Guelph Storm in junior hockey, didn't take long to adapt to the professional level.\\n\\nIn 2005-06, his first full NHL season, Brown found the back of the net 14 times as he established himself within the Kings' lineup. In 2008, Brown was named the 13th captain in Kings history, and he was named an NHL All-Star later that season.\\n\\nBrown never put up eye-popping numbers, but he was a strong two-way forward for much of his career. In 2012 and 2014, Brown led the Kings to a pair of Stanley Cup championships. In the first of those runs, Brown put up 20 points in 20 games.\\n\\nIn the 2016 offseason, Brown was stripped of his captaincy and replaced by Anze Kopitar, but he remained with the Kings for the entirety of his career. Brown retired from the NHL following the 2021-22 season, after 325 goals and 712 points in 1,296 games. He became the third Kings player, along with Wayne Gretzky and Luc Robitaille to get a statue built in his honor.\\n\\nBrent Seabrook | D\\n\\nPick: No. 14 overall\\n\\nTeam: Chicago Blackhawks\\n\\nAll-Star: 2015\\n\\nThree-time Stanley Cup winner Brent Seabrook was drafted immediately behind two-time winner Dustin Brown in the middle of the first round. Talk about a deep draft, and we aren't even close to done.\\n\\nAlong with fellow defenseman Duncan Keith, Seabrook was one of the first real building blocks of the Blackhawks' dynasty that ran from 2010 to 2015. Seabrook fully entrenched himself as an everyday NHL defenseman in 2006-07, and he was an absolute workhorse for the Blackhawks for the next dozen seasons. From 2006-07 to 2018-19, Seabrook played in 1,013 games, which was second only to Patrick Marleau.\\n\\nIn each of Chicago's three Stanley Cup runs, Seabrook averaged at least 23:05 of ice-time per game. In Game 7 of the Hawks' second-round series against the Detroit Red Wings in 2013, Seabrook scored the overtime winner to send them to the Western Conference Final.\\n\\nInjuries marred the last couple seasons of Seabrook's career, and his contract was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2021. Once that deal expires after the 2023-24 campaign, Seabrook will officially retire.\\n\\nZach Parise | LW\\n\\nPick: No. 17 overall\\n\\nTeam: New Jersey Devils\\n\\nAll-Star: 2009\\n\\nIt took a whole three picks to find another All-Star. Coming out of the University of North Dakota, Parise quickly evolved into an elite offensive weapon for the New Jersey Devils. In 2006-07, just his second NHL season, Parise scored 31 goals.\\n\\nThat kicked off a run of four straight seasons in which Parise piled up 146 goals, which ranked sixth in the NHL over that span. A torn meniscus at the start of the 2010-11 season ended that streak by limiting Parise to 13 games played, but he rebounded in a big way the following season. Parise scored 31 goals in the regular season before leading the Devils to the 2012 Stanley Cup Final.\\n\\nThat was Parise's last season with the Devils because he joined Ryan Suter in signing a 13-year deal worth $98 million with the Minnesota Wild in the summer of 2012. Parise's time in Minnesota was hampered by injuries at times, but he still managed to score 199 goals in nine seasons.\\n\\nAfter the Wild bought out Parise's contract in 2021, he found a home with the New York Islanders, where he has extended his career. Parise scored 21 goals with the Isles in 2022-23 and is set to become a free agent on July 1.\\n\\nRyan Getzlaf | C\\n\\nPick: No. 19 overall\\n\\nTeam: Mighty Ducks of Anaheim\\n\\nAll-Star: 2008-2009, 2015\\n\\nThroughout his junior hockey career with the Calgary Hitmen, Getzlaf was an ill-tempered two-way center, and he brought that game to the NHL after getting drafted by the Ducks. Getzlaf spent the entirety of his career bullying opponents and getting under their skin after the whistle.\\n\\nIn just his second NHL season, Getzlaf played a significant role in the Ducks winning their first Stanley Cup in team history. He totaled 58 points in the regular season, and Getzlaf put up seven goals and 10 assists in 21 playoff games.\\n\\nGetzlaf never won another Cup in his career, all of which was spent in Anaheim, but he got agonizingly close. The Ducks lost in Game 7 of the second round twice, and they lost in the Western Conference Final twice more. In his 125 career playoff games, Getzlaf notched 37 goals and 83 assists for 120 points.\\n\\nFollowing the 2021-22 season, Getzlaf retired as the Ducks' all-time leader in games played (1,157), assists (737), and points (1,019).\\n\\nBrent Burns | RW\\n\\nPick: No. 20 overall\\n\\nTeam: Minnesota Wild\\n\\nAll-Star: 2011, 2015-2019\\n\\nBurns made his name as a defenseman for the San Jose Sharks, but he was drafted as a winger, and he spent some time switching between forward and defense in the early portion of his career with the Wild. Burns eventually stuck on the blue line, and that played out quite nicely for him.\\n\\nThroughout his seven seasons in Minnesota, Burns developed into a strong offensive defenseman, but his career took the next step after he was traded to the Sharks during the 2011 NHL Draft. For much of his tenure with San Jose, it seemed like Burns just continued to improve every season. That culminated in the 2016-17 season when he won the Norris Trophy and finished fourth in Hart Trophy voting after tallying 29 goals and 72 points in 82 games.\\n\\nWith the Sharks rebuilding, they traded Burns to the Carolina Hurricanes last summer, and he had a resurgent season with his new team. Despite turning 38 late in the season, Burns still managed to produce 61 points in top-pairing minutes. Expect him to be a big part of Carolina's defense again next season.\\n\\nRyan Kesler | C\\n\\nPick: No. 23 overall\\n\\nTeam: Vancouver Canucks\\n\\nAll-Star: 2011, 2017\\n\\nKesler, who spent time with the under-18 U.S. national team and Ohio State University before getting drafted, was a bit of a late bloomer. He didn't really break out at the NHL level until the 2007-08 season, but once he did, Kesler became a key player on great teams for the Vancouver Canucks and Anaheim Ducks.\\n\\nIn that 2007-08 campaign, Kesler notched 21 goals in 80 games and became a steady two-way presence in the Vancouver lineup. In 2011, Kesler won the Selke Trophy as the NHL's best defensive forward while helping the Canucks win the President's Trophy and reach the Stanley Cup Final, where they lost to the Boston Bruins in seven games.\\n\\nKesler was traded to the Ducks in 2014 and was immediately named an alternate captain. In his first three seasons with Anaheim, Kesler scored 63 goals and totaled 153 points while finishing top-three in Selke voting twice. In that span, the team went to the Western Conference Final twice, but it lost both times.\\n\\nAfter the 2016-17 season, a hip injury derailed Kesler's career, and he played his last NHL game in 2019. He retired with 573 points in 1,001 games played.\\n\\nMike Richards | C\\n\\nPick: No. 24 overall\\n\\nTeam: Philadelphia Flyers\\n\\nAll-Star: 2008\\n\\nThe Flyers were able to select Jeff Carter and Mike Richards in the same draft, just 13 picks apart, and both players are two-time Stanley Cup winners. Unfortunately for Philadelphia, they won those Cups with the Los Angeles Kings.\\n\\nRichards scored 21 goals combined in his first two seasons with the Flyers, and he broke out for 28 goals and 75 points in the 2007-08 season. In September of 2008, Richards was named the 17th captain in Flyers history. In the 2010 playoffs, Richards captained Philadelphia to the Stanley Cup Final and recorded 23 points in 23 games.\\n\\nIn 2011, the Flyers traded Richards to the Kings, where he would eventually be reunited with Carter. In his first year with Los Angeles, Richards totaled 44 points before adding 15 more in the team's run to a Stanley Cup. Two years later, Richards produced 10 points in the Kings' second Stanley Cup run.\\n\\nRichards' time with the Kings came to an end following an off-ice incident in 2015, but he signed a one-year contract with the Washington Capitals in January of 2016. He played 39 games in Washington before ending his career.\\n\\nBrian Boyle | C\\n\\nPick: No. 26 overall\\n\\nTeam: Los Angeles Kings\\n\\nAll-Star: 2018\\n\\nFew players in this draft class are as well-traveled as Brian Boyle. A solid bottom-six forward, Boyle bounced around as an NHL journeyman throughout his career and created value for himself by playing a strong two-way game.\\n\\nBoyle spent just two seasons with the Los Angeles Kings before getting traded to the New York Rangers in 2010. In his second season with the Rangers, Boyle recorded a career-high 21 goals and played a key role for the team until he signed with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2014.\\n\\nThat kicked off a North American tour for Boyle that resulted in him playing for seven teams in the final seven seasons of his career. In the 2017-18 season, Boyle went to his first and only All-Star Game with New Jersey after beating cancer and returning to score 13 goals in 69 games.\\n\\nBoyle retired in March of 2023, and even though he never won a Stanley Cup, he had his share of deep playoff runs. In fact, Boyle made back-to-back Cup Final appearances in 2014 and 2015.\\n\\nCorey Perry | RW\\n\\nPick: No. 28 overall\\n\\nTeam: Mighty Ducks of Anaheim\\n\\nAll-Star: 2008, 2011-2012, 2016\\n\\nThe Ducks selected Ryan Getzlaf and Corey Perry just nine picks from one another. The 2003 draft was a pretty good day at the office for GM Bryan Murray.\\n\\nPerry scored 30 goals in his first two NHL seasons, and he tallied 15 points in the Ducks' 2007 Stanley Cup run. He really broke out in the 2007-08 campaign, when he piled up 29 goals and 54 points in 70 games played. Three years later, Perry won the Hart Trophy after an exceptional season that included 50 goals and 98 points.\\n\\nPerry wound up spending 14 seasons in Anaheim, where he ranks second all-time in goals (372), third in points (776), and second in games played (988). In the summer of 2019, Perry signed with the Dallas Stars and went to the Stanley Cup Final in the NHL bubble that year. The next season, with the Montreal Canadiens, Perry lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Cup Final for the second year in a row.\\n\\nTaking a join them if you can't beat them approach, Perry spent the last two years with the Bolts and lost his third consecutive Stanley Cup Final in 2022. This past season, Perry totaled 12 goals and 25 points in 81 games.\\n\\nLoui Eriksson | LW\\n\\nPick: No. 33 overall\\n\\nTeam: Dallas Stars\\n\\nAll-Star: 2011\\n\\nWe are finally out of the first round, but there is still a long way to go. For now, we'll take a look at Loui Eriksson who was a regular 20- to 30-goal scorer at his peak.\\n\\nFrom 2008-09 to 2011-12, Eriksson was an exceptional top-six forward for the Dallas Stars. In those four seasons, he scored 118 goals, which ranked 19th in that time. Eriksson also established himself as a defensively responsible forward who could be trusted in all three zones.\\n\\nOn the Fourth of July in 2013, Eriksson was traded to the Boston Bruins in a blockbuster trade that saw Tyler Seguin going the other way. Eriksson's first season in boston didn't go as planned, but he tallied 52 goals and 110 points from 2014 to 2016.\\n\\nIn the 2016 offseason, Eriksson signed a six-year contract with the Vancouver Canucks, but his tenure there never really worked out. He scored 38 goals in 252 games with the Canucks and was traded to the Arizona Coyotes in 2021. Eriksson went to play in his home country of Sweden in 2022.\\n\\nPatrice Bergeron | C\\n\\nPick: No. 45 overall\\n\\nTeam: Boston Bruins\\n\\nAll-Star: 2015-2016, 2022\\n\\nOne of the biggest steals in draft history -- and there were several of this in this class -- came when the Boston Bruins called Patrice Bergeron's name in the second round. They wound up getting a franchise player and perhaps the best two-way forward ever to play the game.\\n\\nBergeron made the Bruins' roster as a rookie, and he finished eighth in voting for the 2004 Calder Trophy after notching 16 goals and 23 assists that season. Bergeron found the back of the net 31 times in the 2005-06 season, and he was off and running from there.\\n\\nOver the last 19 seasons, Bergeron has earned a reputation as one of the smartest players and most relentless defenders in the NHL. In his 1,294 career games, Bergeron has totaled 427 goals, 613 assists, and six Selke Trophy wins, including after the 2022-23 season.\\n\\nBergeron's combination of leadership, skill, and tenacity has led the Bruins to a Stanley Cup in 2011, and Boston has been back to the Stanley Cup Final twice since then. Bergeron has played a whopping 170 playoff games, and he has 128 points in that time.\\n\\nShea Weber | D\\n\\nPick: No. 49 overall\\n\\nTeam: Nashville Predators\\n\\nAll-Star: 2009, 2011-2012, 2015-2017, 2020\\n\\nThe Predators didn't land just one franchise defenseman in the 2003 draft. They landed two. After getting Ryan Suter at No. 7 overall, the Preds also got Shea Weber in the middle of the second round.\\n\\nWeber made his NHL debut in the 2005-06 season, but he carved out a regular role for himself in 2006-07. That year, Weber scored 17 goals in 79 games, and he looked like a budding star. Weber spent 11 seasons with the Predators, became the franchise's sixth captain in 2010, and was a perennial Norris Trophy candidate. While he was with Nashville, Weber became a major power play weapon, and he has scored almost as many goals on the power play (106) as he has at even strength (113) throughout his career.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2016, Weber was part of the stunning trade that saw him go to Montreal with P.K. Subban coming to Nashville. Weber continued to play at a high level in his first four seasons with the Habs, and he helped the team reach the Stanley Cup Final in 2020. Unfortunately, injuries derailed his career in 2020-21, and he has not played in the last two seasons. His contract currently sits with the Arizona Coyotes.\\n\\nCorey Crawford | G\\n\\nPick: No. 52 overall\\n\\nTeam: Chicago Blackhawks\\n\\nAll-Star: 2015, 2017\\n\\nCrawford spent the first five seasons of his professional career developing with the AHL's Norfolk Admirals and Rockford IceHogs. By the time Crawford took over the crease in Chicago, he was more than ready for the NHL level.\\n\\nIn 2010-11, Crawford started 55 games and posted a 2.30 GAA with a .917 save percentage. Just a couple of years later, Crawford started all 23 games in the 2013 postseason as he backstopped the Blackhawks to the Stanley Cup. His GAA was a minuscule 1.84, and his save percentage was a terrific .932.\\n\\nTwo years after that, Crawford did it again as he posted a pair of shutouts in 19 playoff starts. For the second time in three years, Crawford played a huge role in helping Chicago lift the Stanley Cup.\\n\\nCrawford held strong for a few more seasons in Chicago, but his performance dipped in 2018-19, and he played his final game for the Blackhawks in 2020. That summer, Crawford signed with the New Jersey Devils but retired before ever playing a game for them.\\n\\nDavid Backes | RW\\n\\nPick: No. 62 overall\\n\\nTeam: St. Louis Blues\\n\\nAll-Star: 2011\\n\\nDavid Backes was the third future captain to be taken in the second round of the 2003 draft, joining Weber and Bergeron. He scored 10 goals as a rookie in the 2006-07 season and quickly became an integral part of the Blues organization.\\n\\nBackes recorded a 31-goal season in 2008-09, and he became the 21st captain in St. Louis history prior to the 2010-11 season, which became his second 31-goal campaign. Backes wound up spending a decade with the Blues, and he ranks in the top-10 of numerous categories in the franchise record books.\\n\\nIn 2016, Backes signed with the Boston Bruins and spent parts of four seasons there. In 2019, Backes reached the Stanley Cup Final with the Bruins, and he totaled five points in 15 playoff games. Backes was traded to the Anaheim Ducks in 2020, and he signed a one-day contract to retire with the Blues in 2021. Backes finished his career with 248 goals and 561 points in 965 games.\\n\\nJimmy Howard | G\\n\\nPick: No. 64 overall\\n\\nTeam: Detroit Red Wings\\n\\nAll-Star: 2012, 2019\\n\\nHoward didn't play his rookie season until 2009-10, but he burst onto the scene with a 2.26 GAA and .924 save percentage. Howard finished second in Calder Trophy voting and eighth in Vezina Trophy voting.\\n\\nHoward took over the starter's crease in Detroit for the next decade, and he compiled 246 wins, 24 shutouts, a 2.62 GAA, and .912 save percentage in 543 games played. Howard backstopped the Red Wings in seven different postseasons, but he never reached the Western Conference Final.\\n\\nThe Red Wings didn't re-sign Howard after the 2019-20 season, and Howard announced his retirement in January of 2021.\\n\\nJoe Pavelski | C\\n\\nPick: No. 205 overall\\n\\nTeam: San Jose Sharks\\n\\nAll-Star: 2016-2017, 2019, 2022\\n\\nThere may be no better steal in NHL Draft history than Joe Pavelski going to the Sharks in the seventh round. Pavelski just completed his 17th NHL season, and he posted 77 points while playing on the best line in the league.\\n\\nPavelski played his rookie season in 2006-07, and he notched 28 points in 46 games. After that season, his role with the Sharks would only continue to grow until he rose to the status of a franchise player. Pavelski played 963 games in San Jose and led the team to the Stanley Cup Final in 2016. In the franchise record books, Pavelski still ranks second in goals (355), fourth in assists (406), and third in points (761).\\n\\nFollowing the 2018-19 season, Pavelski signed with the Dallas Stars as a free agent, and he has somehow taken his game to the next level. In his four seasons with the Stars, Pavelski has 240 points in 287 games. This past postseason, Pavelski totaled nine goals and 14 points in 14 games. He re-signed with the Stars on a one-year, $3.5 million contract for the 2023-24 season.\\n\\nTobias Enstrom | D\\n\\nPick: No. 239 overall\\n\\nTeam: Atlanta Thrashers\\n\\nAll-Star: 2011\\n\\nWe have now entered the eighth round of the 2003 draft, which is a round that no longer exists and we're on to a pick from a team that anymore either. Atlanta didn't uncover any All-Stars in the first seven rounds, but they found one here.\\n\\nEnstrom made the Thrashers' roster in 2007-08, and he put up 38 points in 82 games on the blue line. Those numbers earned him first-team All-Rookie honors, and Enstrom finished sixth in Calder Trophy voting. In 2010-11, Enstrom was selected to the All-Star game while he was in the midst of a career year, but he wasn't able to play in the game due to injury.\\n\\nEnstrom spent his entire 11-year NHL career with the Thrashers/Winnipeg Jets franchise, and he left the NHL following the 2017-18 season, when he went back to play in Sweden.\\n\\nDustin Byfuglien | D\\n\\nPick: No. 245 overall\\n\\nTeam: Chicago Blackhawks\\n\\nAll-Star: 2011, 2015-2016\\n\\nJust six picks after Enstrom, the Blackhawks selected Dustin Byfuglien, who would become a key member of the 2010 Stanley Cup team. Drafted as a defenseman, Byfuglien would do much of his damage in Chicago while on the wing.\\n\\nByfuglien spent his first five NHL seasons with the Blackhawks, and his tenure there culminated with that special 2009-10 season. He scored 34 points in 82 games, and he added 16 points in 22 playoff games. After that season, Chicago traded Byfuglien to the Trashers, were he returned to the blue line and became a force on defense.\\n\\nIn his nine seasons with Atlanta and Winnipeg, Byfuglien tallied 416 points in 609 games, and he helped the Jets reach the Western Conference Final in 2018. Byfuglien's time with the Jets ended on a sour note, and he hasn't played since April of 2019.\\n\\nJaroslav Halak | G\\n\\nPick: No. 271 overall\\n\\nTeam: Montreal Canadiens\\n\\nAll-Star: 2015\\n\\nAs if the eighth round wasn't late enough, Halak heard his name called by the Montreal Canadiens in the ninth round of the draft. That's a decent value for a goalie who just completed his 17th NHL season.\\n\\nHalak has bounced around quite a bit throughout his NHL career, playing mostly in a backup role, but he has taken on a starter's workload here and there. On two separate occasions, Halak has been part of a goaltending tandem that won the Jennings Trophy for the fewest goals allowed.\\n\\nIn the 2014-15 season, while Halak was with the New York Islanders, he earned an All-Star appearance by posting a GAA of 2.43 and a save percentage of .914. Since then, Halak has primarily been a veteran backup for various teams, most recently the New York Rangers in 2022-23.\\n\\nBrian Elliott | G\\n\\nPick: No. 291 overall\\n\\nTeam: Ottawa Senators\\n\\nAll-Star: 2012, 2015\\n\\nElliott was selected with the second-to-last pick in the 2003 draft. All he has done since then is play 16 seasons in the NHL.\\n\\nMuch like Halak, Elliott spent time alternating between backup and starter. The best seasons of his career came when he was a member of the St. Louis Blues. In the 2011-12 campaign, Halak finished the year with a GAA of 1.56 and a save percentage of .940. Both of those numbers led the league. Just a few years later, in 2014-15, Elliott posted a 2.26 GAA and a .917 save percentage.\\n\\nFor the past two seasons, Elliott has backed up Andrei Vasilevskiy as a member of the Tampa Bay Lightning. In 2021-22, Elliott reached the Stanley Cup Final for the first time in his career.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Minneapolis Star Tribune\", \"author\": \"Sarah McLellan\", \"title\": \"Minnesota Wild acquire veteran forward Pat Maroon in trade with Tampa Bay\", \"description\": \"The three-time Stanley Cup champion led the NHL with 150 penalty minutes last season.\", \"url\": \"https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-wild-tampa-bay-lightning-pat-maroon-trade-max-cajkovic/600287036/\", \"text\": \"The Wild didn't add the veteran forward they coveted on Saturday during the first day of NHL free agency, but they did acquire that player in a trade before the weekend was over.\\n\\nThree-time Stanley Cup champion Pat Maroon joined the Wild on Sunday from Tampa Bay, along with minor-leaguer Max Cajkovic, in exchange for a 2024 seventh-round pick.\\n\\nSince the Lightning retained 20% of Maroon's contract, which expires after next season, the Wild are the hook for only $800,000, which is exactly how much General Manager Bill Guerin said the team had to spend after a quiet start to free agency.

It\\u2019s a little bittersweet for now, but tomorrow, everything is going to be great.\\u201d\\n\\nRetaining Killorn ultimately ended up being unrealistic given Tampa Bay\\u2019s salary cap constraints. The Lightning had just $7.325 million of cap space to work with entering the day, but used it to make the necessary moves to retool their forward lines with three value deals, signing Conor Sheary, Luke Glendening and Josh Archibald, spending a cap hit of just $3.6 million for next season\\u2019s payroll to do it.\\n\\n\\u201cAll three of these forwards are really effective checkers who will help you protect leads, can play against the other team\\u2019s best players so it\\u2019s not always on our first and second line to get those matchups,\\u201d general manager Julien BriseBois said. \\u201cAnd I think that\\u2019s going to also free up some of our higher-scoring forwards from some of those defensive responsibilities, knowing that our players that will likely be in our bottom six are able to assume that role for us.\\u201d\\n\\nThe team also signed goaltender Jonas Johansson, to be the team\\u2019s new backup to Andrei Vasilevskiy, on a two-year deal worth a $775,000 average annual value.\\n\\nSheary, who averaged 16 goals the past three seasons playing with the Capitals, was a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the Penguins in 2016 and 2017.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old, who had 15 goals and 22 assists with a plus-9 in 82 games with Washington last season, signed a three-year deal for a $2 million average annual value.

And had to make decisions as to how best to allocate our cap space, and considering what we project that Ross will be awarded had we gone to salary arbitration, it just made more sense to trade him and use that cap space somewhere else and get an asset in return to hopefully replenish the pipeline.\\u201d\\n\\nColton had 16 goals and 16 assists last season while playing primarily on the Lightning\\u2019s third line. It was a dip from his 22-goal, 17-assist first full NHL season in 2021-22 but enough to get a major salary bump. After the 2020-21 season, Colton signed a two-year, $1.125 million average annual value (AAV) contract as an arbitration-eligible restricted free agent. He was projected for a $3.351 million AAV offseason extension, according to Evolving Hockey.\\n\\nBriseBois said he knew that he wouldn\\u2019t be able to retain Colton, unrestricted free agent Alex Killorn and restricted free agent Tanner Jeannot but still hopes he can keep two of the players. He said he\\u2019s had conversations with Killorn\\u2019s representatives, and both sides are looking for a solution to make him a career-long Lightning player. Tampa Bay has made a qualifying offer to Jeannot, who was acquired at the deadline for five draft picks and defenseman Cal Foote.\\n\\n\\u201cAll of us want him to stay,\\u201d BriseBois said of Killorn. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a big part of our organization and has played a huge role in the past. ... Alex has stated publicly as well that he has a very strong preference to play for the Lightning and continue his career here and end his career with us, which is what we\\u2019re trying to accomplish here. But, obviously, we haven\\u2019t come to terms yet.\\u201d\\n\\nA fourth-round pick out of the USHL in 2016, Colton was a player development success story. After college hockey at Vermont, he played two full seasons at AHL Syracuse before joining the Lightning six weeks into the 2020-21 season, playing first on the team\\u2019s fourth line. He could play center or wing, score goals, and brought a strong possession, puck-battling and forechecking game. Armed with a rocket shot from the right circle, he emerged as a scoring threat on Tampa Bay\\u2019s second-team power-play unit, scoring four of his 16 goals last season with the man-advantage.\\n\\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\\u2019s college football teams every day.

He also scored the winner on the road in Game 2 of the second-round series against Florida in 2022.

I\\u2019m really appreciative of the way he went about his business, the way he conducted himself and worked his way into becoming an NHL player. That\\u2019s role-model stuff for our future prospects.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Lightning currently have just 17 players under one-way contracts and only about $7.325 million of cap space left, including the final year of retired defenseman Brent Seabrook\\u2019s contract, which allows them $6.875 million of cap space through long-term injured reserve.\\n\\nBriseBois said he doesn\\u2019t see further need to trade another player to become cap-compliant this season.\\n\\nBefore trading Colton, the Lightning didn\\u2019t have a pick in this year\\u2019s draft until the sixth round (179th overall). Despite being focused on their one sixth-round pick and two seventh-rounders, the Lightning\\u2019s amateur scouting department prepared a list of targets in case the team made a trade to acquire a higher pick.

That doesn\\u2019t include defenseman Darren Raddysh, who is currently on a two-way deal but will almost certainly make the opening night roster.\\n\\nGeneral manager Julien BriseBois is always looking to upgrade, but he\\u2019d have to unload a player to create cap space. That\\u2019s not entirely impossible, but at this point in the free agency season, this is the roster we should expect going into training camp in September.\\n\\nThe Lightning have had to part ways with several key pieces \\u2014 Alex Killorn, Ross Colton Pat Maroon and Corey Perry among them \\u2014 and BriseBois brought their replacements in with a focus on becoming faster and better defensively. Now that the roster for the upcoming season appears to be complete, what do we make of it?\\n\\nWhere does Conor Sheary fit in?\\n\\nAmong the Lightning\\u2019s free-agency additions, the 31-year-old Sheary figures to make the biggest impact among the newcomers. He averaged 16 goals a year in his past three seasons in Washington. The Lightning had to go bargain shopping in free agency and Sheary \\u2014 signed to a three-year, $2 million average annual value contract \\u2014 is the only newcomer making more than a $1 million annually and the only one to get a deal of more than two years.\\n\\nSheary can play across any of the top three lines; in Washington, he shared a line with Alex Ovechkin. Last season, he assisted on seven of Ovechkin\\u2019s goals. As part of Pittsburgh teams that won back-to-back Stanley Cups, Sheary played with Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. Not every player can excel skating with elite talent, and Sheary could get a look with Brayden Point and Nikita Kucherov on the Lightning\\u2019s top scoring line. Brandon Hagel showed he could mesh with Point and Kucherov, but he might be better used alongside Anthony Cirelli on the two-way line.\\n\\nSheary can player on either wing, and his defense and forechecking can fit all over. His flexibility to play in different spots will be beneficial to the Lightning as Jon Cooper finds the right fit, especially after losing a top-six forward in Killorn.\\n\\nHow important is a full season of Tanner Jeannot?\\n\\nThe departure of Killorn and Maroon puts a lot of pressure on Tanner Jeannot as he enters his first full season in a Tampa Bay uniform. The Lightning would love to see him regain the 24-goal form of his rookie season two years ago. That would help them replace Killorn\\u2019s offensive output, and they\\u2019ll also need him play the role of the team\\u2019s primary enforcer with Maroon gone.\\n\\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\\u2019s college football teams every day.

Explore all your options\\n\\nIt took Jeannot some time to find his footing with the Lightning, and he was just starting to look comfortable when he was injured late in the regular season. It will be important for him to get off to a quick start this season. He had 17 goals in his first 51 games during his rookie season. He is a guy who will do most of his damage offensively in front of the net, and the big difference in his scoring dropoff was his shooting percentage falling from 19.4 to 5.6.\\n\\nNo matter where he plays in the middle six, he should get plenty of opportunities to score. He could even see power-play time with the Lightning needing to replace Killorn\\u2019s presence in front, but he\\u2019ll have to convert more to make the difference the Lightning want.\\n\\nIf he does slot into a third-line role, he will pair with Nick Paul, who was on pace for a 31-goal season before he ended with just one goal and a 2.2 shooting percentage in his last 38 regular-season games. They both can\\u2019t be that streaky.\\n\\nHow will the blue line look?\\n\\nWhether the Lightning\\u2019s defenseman corps is better next season remains to be seen, but there\\u2019s definitely more options than this time last year. That means there will be more competition for third pairing minutes.\\n\\nThe departure of Ian Cole, who was a stabilizing veteran but led the team in penalties, left the Lightning with just three left-shot defensemen. The signing of Calvin de Haan gives them a fourth and he will compete with Haydn Fleury for third pairing minutes.\\n\\nKeep in mind that last year\\u2019s opening night roster didn\\u2019t include right-shot defensemen Zach Bogosian, who was injured, or Nick Perbix or Darren Raddysh, who opened the season at AHL Syracuse. All three will be in the fold going into this season along with top right-shot defenseman Erik Cernak.\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see what happens with right-shot defenseman Philippe Myers, the forgotten front piece of the Ryan McDonagh trade. BriseBois spoke glowingly of him at the end of last season, and he carries a $1.4 million cap hit. He was an emergency option for the Lightning late in the playoffs, but spent the entire season in Syracuse after he was demoted in early December.\\n\\nMikhail Sergachev took a huge step forward in his offensive game with career highs in assists (54) and points (64) while assuming a new role on the first power-play unit, but he knows he still has work to do as he enters the first year of an eight-year, $68 million extension.\\n\\nDo the Lightning have better depth at forward?\\n\\nWith the signings of Sheary, Luke Glendening and Josh Archibald, the Lightning have 12 forwards on one-way NHL contracts, but added Logan Brown and Mitchell Chaffee on two-way contracts. BriseBois said both will have the opportunity to \\u201csteal a job\\u201d in training camp. The Lightning still don\\u2019t know where Alex Barre-Boulet fits after another season of putting up numbers in the AHL with a career-high 84 points. As of now, he\\u2019s the team\\u2019s 12th forward on an NHL deal and would have to clear waivers again if he doesn\\u2019t make the opening roster.\\n\\nBrown and Chafee will also compete for a forward spot along with Cole Koepke and Gabriel Fortier, both of whom saw time in Tampa last season, and prospects Gage Goncalves, Lucas Edmonds and international signee Waltteri Merela will be knocking on the door.\\n\\nBrown is intriguing. At 6-foot-6, 218 pounds, he has size you can\\u2019t teach. He has first-round pedigree and 99 games of NHL experience, and while his scoring numbers haven\\u2019t duplicated his juniors and AHL success, he can earn a bottom-six job by playing a heavy game.\\n\\nHow much will goaltender Jonas Johansson play?\\n\\nThe biggest revelation that emerged from the Lightning\\u2019s playoff postmortem was Andrei Vasilevskiy\\u2019s admission that he felt out of whack from the midseason mark. In signing Johansson to be Vasilevskiy\\u2019s backup, the Lightning were delighted to pick up a young goaltender they feel has untapped potential for the league minimum of $775,000.\\n\\nJohansson is 27 and has great size (6-5, 220 pounds), and the club hopes he might be able help Vasilevskiy carry the load with more consistency than departed 38-year-old Brian Elliott, who certainly played better than his numbers showed early, but saw his game really fade down the stretch.\\n\\nJohansson has never really gotten a chance at the NHL level, playing no more than 15 games in any of his four seasons. But he put up good numbers in his last stop in Colorado (10-3-2, .901 save percentage, 2.78 goals against average over parts of two seasons) and had a .920 save percentage and 2.33 GAA last season in the AHL.\\n\\nIf he can provide anything comparable to those numbers while giving Vasilevskiy \\u2014 who has averaged 73 games (including the playoffs) the past four years \\u2014 some added rest, this might be the team\\u2019s best bargain signing. He will get the opportunity to show his value.\\n\\n\\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022\\n\\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\\n\\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

Anaheim finished last season 37 points short of a playoff berth.\\n\\nIf Killorn declines in the years to come he may not be an impact player by the time the Ducks are ready to win. Anaheim is willing to take that chance partly due to the fact the team has $27,873 million in cap space even after inking Killorn.\\n\\nIt's possible that this deal will not be an efficient use of funds for the team, but Anaheim has such an abundance of funds that efficiency isn't top of mind. Bringing Killorn in now might be early in the context of the Ducks' competitive window, but he's a luxury they can afford.\\n\\nThe winger's experience in 11 years with the Tampa Bay Lightning could also prove valuable as he has the credibility to set an example for some of Anaheim's younger players.

Toronto is going all-in in pursuit of an elusive Stanley Cup and if the team falters out of the gate, Boucher could be viewed cynically as a potential stop-gap option in the event Keefe is dismissed.\\n\\nVan Ryn played 353 games in the NHL, finishing his career with the Maple Leafs during the 2009-10 season.

Van Ryn also excelled during his single season with the AHL\\u2019s Tucson Roadrunners, which resulted in an exit in the division finals.\\n\\nFollowing his stint with the Roadrunners, Van Ryn won a Stanley Cup with the St. Louis Blues as an assistant coach in 2018-19.

Coming off his first professional season at AHL Syracuse, the defenseman feels like he\\u2019s stronger and smarter. For many, the AHL is a crash course in physicality and speed of the game, and it can take time to perfect both.\\n\\nThompson was pleased with how he tested in the weight room during the Lightning\\u2019s development camp earlier this month, showing improvement everywhere, notably with his skating. But for Thompson, one of the best lessons he learned from his introduction to pro hockey was watching one of his older teammates graduate to an NHL contributor.\\n\\nDarren Raddysh is six years older than the 21-year-old Thompson. The Lightning were his third organization, so he\\u2019s seen a lot more. But Thompson said that playing alongside Raddysh, a fellow right-shot defenseman, helped him understand what it takes to be successful in the AHL and earn a promotion to the NHL. Raddysh opened last season in Syracuse, was called up by the Lightning in March, then ended the season averaging 25 minutes a game in the playoffs.\\n\\n\\u201cI think we\\u2019re similar sizes, and I think just how he positions himself in the defensive zone,\\u201d Thompson, the Lightning\\u2019s third-round pick in 2020, said of Raddysh. \\u201cWe both aren\\u2019t going to run guys over, let\\u2019s say, but I think he\\u2019s really good with his stick. He\\u2019s really good at his body positioning. And then once he gets the puck, he has really good patience. ... And he\\u2019s talked to me a lot. He still talks to me every day. We\\u2019re pretty good buddies. And I thank him for that.\\u201d\\n\\nExamples all over\\n\\nSeeing is believing with greener players. It\\u2019s no coincidence that when the Lightning hold their development camp every summer, stars like Nikita Kucherov and Andrei Vasilevskiy also train at the same time. Brayden Point is there leaning up against the glass watching skill drills. Being around champion players serves as an added layer of motivation.\\n\\nWhile the development camp includes weight room testing, skills and skating drills, and 3-on-3 competitions, the film study work that prospects do is equally important. They watch how players like Point improved his skating to become an elite goal scorer, and they analyze their own film year over year to see their progress.\\n\\n\\u201cI had a few discussions with the younger guys and you can definitely see, you know, they\\u2019re looking up to guys, all these guys have been through the system,\\u201d said Lightning player development director J.P.

Kucherov is practicing with other guys. Vasy is here. So it feels like it\\u2019s a family feeling.\\u201d\\n\\nThe camp week begins with skating coach Barb Underhill recording players\\u2019 strides with an iPad. The tablets are all over the ice at the TGH IcePlex early on in camp, positioned by the bench to record goaltenders and even at center ice for a broader view of drills. Ultimately, the goal is to use video to point out strengths and weaknesses, then show players their progress by putting clips side by side.\\n\\n\\u201cSometimes they\\u2019re not just even clips of top players in the NHL, it\\u2019s about them,\\u201d said new AHL Syracuse Crunch coach Joel Bouchard. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about seeing something that you might think you know, but then you see it from a different angle and then you just need that to click sometimes. ... It doesn\\u2019t lie.\\n\\nAn open conversation\\n\\nBouchard, a well-regarded player development coach in the junior and AHL ranks, said the video starts a conversation with each player. Camp was capped by players having exit interviews with coaches and staff.\\n\\n\\u201cI think 2023 is an open conversation,\\u201d Bouchard said. \\u201cSometimes it\\u2019s where the player takes you. ... It\\u2019s about working together, putting the standard to a certain level and then when you can validate and show something that\\u2019s tangible, then it makes it easier for everybody to see where we are trying to be. ...\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a generation that wants to be part of the process, and we have to include them. We have to respect how they see it from their perspective, and then come to an understanding.\\u201d\\n\\nPlayers attending the camp come in at varying places in their careers, from 18-year-old draftees to players in junior ranks and college hockey to pros in the ECHL and AHL.\\n\\nForward Dylan Duke, the Lightning\\u2019s fourth-round pick in 2021, was attending his third development camp. The Lightning think highly of him, and as he enters his third college season at Michigan, they have seen him make strides every year. He was one of the top players in camp this month and he credited the Lightning for helping him make major strides with his skating.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely important to be able to see visuals of myself and then also learn from seeing videos of other guys,\\u201d Duke said. \\u201cI\\u2019m a visual learner, so to see that stuff, to kind of be able to see from past couple years my stride progress, I think it\\u2019s definitely getting better but something that I\\u2019ve got to keep working on. I think I\\u2019m a lot more powerful, my mechanics are better but nothing\\u2019s perfect, so I\\u2019m just gonna keep working at it every day every summer. Just trying to be the best I can be.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Lightning have a strong player development reputation, and if they want to see how quickly they can progress, they only need to look to last summer\\u2019s roster, which included Nick Perbix. Despite not making the opening night roster, Perbix played 69 games for the Lightning and ended the season with Victor Hedman in the team\\u2019s top defenseman pairing.\\n\\n\\u201cI think players are smart in 2023,\\u201d Bouchard said. \\u201cThey realize what they need to work on.

Kane\\u2019s former Blackhawks teammate Jonathan Toews is available, though he has combined for just 27 goals and 68 points over the past two years since missing the entire 2020-21 season due to chronic immune response syndrome.\\n\\nTampa Bay forward Alex Killorn, who put up career-best numbers with 27 goals, 37 assists and 64 points, will attract attention, though he\\u2019s 34, and the Lightning are still hoping to re-sign him. Dmitry Orlov is regarded as the free agent class\\u2019s top defenseman, while Frederik Andersen, Tristan Jerry and Antti Raanta are among the goalies expected to be available.\\n\\nThe flat cap has led to more teams going the trade route to acquire talent because the player\\u2019s salary is already established, as opposed to the uncertainty that comes with having to negotiate a contract in free agency, and the potential of other teams entering the mix and upping the price.\\n\\n\\u201cUltimately, I think people are looking at the free agency market and it\\u2019s kind of thin this year.

Of the 166 NHL unrestricted free agent contracts signed Saturday, 68 were one- or two-year deals. The Boston Bruins, New York Rangers and Edmonton Oilers were also among the teams to hand out contracts with bonus incentives.\\n\\nNew York signed veteran winger Blake Wheeler, fresh off his buyout in Winnipeg, to an $800,000 contract with $300,000 more in bonuses and two-time Stanley Cup-winning goaltender Jonathan Quick, fresh off backing up for Vegas on its title run, to an $825,000 contract with $100,000 more in bonuses.\\n\\nThat was certainly a plan going into the offseason for Rangers GM Chris Drury, who knew he'd be losing wingers Patrick Kane and Vladimir Tarasenko in free agency because of his team's cap picture.\\n\\n\\u201cYou create your lists and get guys in order and start doing your homework,\\u201d Drury said Saturday. \\u201cI think everyone in this business \\u2014 agents and players alike \\u2014 are aware of the limited cap space we do have and did have.\\u201d\\n\\nThat's a big club that includes everyone from the 2020 and '21 champion Tampa Bay Lightning to the Boston Bruins, coming off setting NHL records for wins and points in a regular season and losing in the first round of the playoffs.\\n\\n\\u201cThe flat cap is difficult for all 32 GMs,\\u201d Lightning GM Julien BriseBois said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not tougher for me than it is for them.\\u201d\\n\\nBriseBois was sad to see big winger Alex Killorn leave for a lucrative deal in Anaheim and Ian Cole sign in Vancouver, but he added versatile winger Conor Sheary for three years, defensive center Luke Glendening for two and depth forward Josh Archibald and defenseman Calvin de Haan for next season.\\n\\nThe Lightning also traded three-time Cup winner Patrick Maroon and fellow forward Max Cajkovic to Minnesota for a 2024 seventh-round pick. Tampa Bay retained 20% of Maroon's $1 million salary, which clears enough space to sign a player at the league minimum of $775,000 \\u2014 perhaps with bonuses.\\n\\nThe Bruins similarly said goodbye to winger Tyler Bertuzzi and Garnet Hathaway and defenseman Dmitry Orlov: their three trade deadline acquisitions who helped them break the records. Boston, among several bargain contracts, brought back 2011 Cup winner Milan Lucic \\u2014 on a bonus-heavy deal paying him $1 million with $500,000 in incentives.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nBertuzzi joined the one-year-contract trend, signing for $5.5 million with Toronto for next season.\\n\\nWith seasoned GM Ken Holland heading into likely his final season on the job and aiming to win right now, Edmonton was even more creative in signing winger Connor Brown, who's coming off tearing the ACL in his right knee.

He didn't know when he'd get drafted, which city he'd move to, or just how hard his world was going to \\\"get turned upside down.\\\"\\n\\nNow, as the Washington Capitals prepare to bring aboard Ryan Leonard into the organizational ranks after drafting him 8th overall, the 31-year-old seasoned veteran Connolly has some words of advice for the young gun, sprouting from his own personal experience. Though Leonard will fulfill his collegiate obligation at Boston College for one year before entering the Caps' organization, Connolly's words could serve as a guiding light for the 18-year-old.\\n\\n\\\"The work is actually just beginning,\\\" Connolly told NBC Sports Washington last week. \\\"There's gonna be lots of ups and downs, and I think it's just a matter of how you handle those. I think you just gotta prepare in the offseason, during the season as best you can and just believe in your abilities at all times. Just do your best every day and let everything else kind of take care of itself.\\\"\\n\\nBrett Connolly is back!!\\n\\n\\n\\nI interviewed the former @Capitals fan favorite and Stanley Cup Champion for @NBCSCapitals to discuss many things, including his NHL Draft memories.\\n\\n\\n\\nHis advice for Ryan Leonard et al. is \\ud83c\\udfaf pic.twitter.com/4b3MQybBCA \\u2014 Bijan Todd (@bijan_todd) July 14, 2023\\n\\nConnolly didn't have to wait too long to hear his name was called on draft night, as he was selected sixth overall by the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Canadian winger was described by hockey scouts as someone who has \\\"Got it all. He can make things happen all by himself. ... He looks like he's going to be a natural leader.\\\"\\n\\nFor all the pre-draft hype he got as a teenager, Connolly would take a little while to get his legs under him in the NHL, as most draft picks do. He would return to the Prince Georges Cougars of the Western Hockey League for another year after hearing his name on draft night, then appear in 68 games for Tampa Bay the following year, where he'd amass 15 points.\\n\\nConnolly would play just 16 games over the next two years in the NHL, spending most of his time at AHL Syracuse. In 2014-15, he established himself in an NHL lineup. Five years after being drafted by Tampa Bay, Connolly was traded to Boston where he would spend just over a season. Then, his career took off when he got the call from Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan to join the Capitals in 2016.\\n\\nConnolly spent three years in Washington where he would put up career-bests in games played (217), goals (52), and assists (44). He kept his own advice close to heart while progressing through the pros, which he now imparts onto Ryan Leonard, in addition to the five other young guns Washington drafted this year.\\n\\n\\\"There's gonna be challenges throughout your career, but I think if you do the right things and you give it everything you have in the offseason, during the season, play for your teammates, and be a good teammate, your career will go what it was meant to go I think,\\\" Connolly said.\\n\\nIn retrospect, that's exactly what happened for Connolly. Just shy of the two-year anniversary of his joining the Capitals, the No. 10 winger supplied the primary assist on the Stanley Cup-winning goal in Game 5 vs. the Vegas Golden Knights in 2018. He appeared in every playoff game for Washington during that memorable run.\\n\\nConnolly enjoyed productive seasons in Florida and Chicago after departing Washington one year after hoisting the Cup. He played in Switzerland this past season for HC Lugano in his first taste of European hockey, something he calls a \\\"completely different game\\\" from that in the NHL thanks to the bigger ice sheet.\\n\\nHis hockey career still going strong, Connolly continues to take the lessons learned on and since draft night to keep his game tight. For the six Capitals' draftees this summer, that journey is just now beginning. Connolly can serve as an example of how he can put himself in the best possible position going forward.\\n\\n\\\"Just a long road ahead of them, a great road, but I think there's gonna be more positives than negatives hopefully for the majority of [this year's draft picks] as they navigate through their career,\\\" Connolly said. \\\"Where you're picked, it doesn't really matter. You gotta kinda carve your own path and do your own right things. It's a long, fun road and it goes fast...it's a fun ride, for sure.\\\"\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Yahoo Entertainment\", \"author\": \"The Canadian Press\", \"title\": \"Canucks bolster blueline with Carson Soucy signing from Kraken\", \"description\": \"VANCOUVER \\u2014 The Vancouver Canucks are beefing up their blue line as part of NHL free agency on Saturday.

However, the contract was tolled from last season to the upcoming season, meaning that it is now due to expire next July.\\n\\nNHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly has stated that, \\\"If Ivan Fedotov plays in the KHL, it will be contrary to his contractual obligations to the Philadelphia Flyers.\\\" This saga is especially pertinent after the Flyers drafted highly-touted Russian prospect Matvei Michkov in the 2023 draft. Michkov is expected to come over to North America when his contract with SKA Saint Petersburg ends in 2026.\\n\\nLast July, Fedotov was reportedly detained in Russia for allegedly evading military service by signing a NHL contract.\\n\\nKings extend Anze Kopitar\\n\\nThe Los Angeles Kings signed captain Anze Kopitar to a two-year, $14-million contract extension on Thursday. The deal takes Kopitar through the 2025-26 season.\\n\\nKopitar recently completed his 17th NHL season, all of which have come as a member of the Kings. He led the team in scoring with 74 points (28 goals, 46 assists) and suited up for all 82 games.\\n\\nThe native of Slovenia was instrumental in helping the Kings win Stanley Cup championships in 2012 and 2014 and is all over the franchise's all-time leaderboards in just about every category.

If you\\u2019re missing the playoffs and still on this list, it\\u2019s not a good sign, and it\\u2019s likely time to examine a complete rebuild. Sadly for fans in Canadian markets, five of the seven Canadian NHL teams fall in this bottom tier, many without playoff success to show for it. Conversely, teams including the Vegas Golden Knights, Tampa Bay Lightning, and Colorado Avalanche all have Cups in recent years, utilizing picks and prospects to get them over the top.\\n\\nComing soon, we\\u2019ll count down the NHL\\u2019s best prospect pools, but for now, here\\u2019s a look at the team\\u2019s with the worst prospect pools in the NHL.\\n\\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nTop three prospects: Xavier Bourgault, Matvei Petrov, Raphael Lavoie\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Beau Akey (56th overall)\\n\\nSorry Oilers fans, but with the graduation of Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway to the NHL, the prospect cupboard is bare. Ken Holland has a way of doing that, but he also inherited a bad prospect situation and then compounded it. Matvei Petrov could turn into a steal for the Oilers if he can duplicate his success from the OHL level in the AHL next year. The stock of two other Oilers prospects \\u2014 Carter Savoie and Raphael Lavoie \\u2014 needs to be determined this year. It\\u2019s a group that is thin from top to bottom, and not picking until 56th overall this year didn\\u2019t help.\\n\\nTop three prospects: Owen Pickering, Brayden Yager, Joel Blomqvist\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Brayden Yager (14th overall)\\n\\nAfter years of not having a first round pick, the Pittsburgh Penguins have now used two in a row. Last year, they selected big blueliner Owen Pickering, followed this year by Brayden Yager, a highly skilled centre. They\\u2019re the picks the Penguins have been waiting for, as the team begins trying to amass youth again. Joel Blomqvist is coming to the AHL this season after a down year, but he\\u2019s the lone goaltender in the Pens system on a current NHL trajectory.\\n\\n30. Tampa Bay Lightning\\n\\nTop three prospects: Isaac Howard, Jack Thompson, Gage Goncalves\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Ethan Gauthier (37th overall)\\n\\nIsaac Howard didn\\u2019t have a great first NCAA season with Minnesota-Duluth, and Tampa will be hoping beyond hopes that his elite release starts finding the back of the net. He\\u2019s the top prospect in the organization, particularly as the Lightning have not picked high often in recent years. Jack Thompson had a steady first season in the AHL with Syracuse and will likely get a look with the Lightning soon. It feels like Gage Goncalves is set to become the next overripe prospect into Tampa. He has two full seasons in the AHL under his belt without a call up, but don\\u2019t count on that again next season. Other names to watch in Tampa Bay\\u2019s system include Hugo Alnefelt, Dylan Duke, and Niko Huuhtanen.\\n\\n29. Vegas Golden Knights\\n\\nTop three prospects: Brendan Brisson, Matyas Sapovaliv, Lukas Cormier\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: David Edstrom (32nd overall)\\n\\nWhat the Vegas Golden Knights have is a Stanley Cup. What they don\\u2019t have is a prospect pool. They traded away almost every piece and pick acquired in their first two seasons of existence for a chance to win the Stanley Cup, and it paid off in 2023. Now, Vegas needs to see how long their current roster can hold, because internal reinforcements are few and far between. Brendan Brisson was a surprise first round pick when the Golden Knights took him in 2020, but he\\u2019s on track to make his NHL debut next season taking some spot duty. Matyas Sapovaliv is another player who continues to move in the right developmental direction. On the back end, Lukas Cormier had a strong rookie pro season in AHL Henderson. Vegas got solid upside at this year\\u2019s draft in David Edstrom and Mathieu Cataford to give a boost to their pool. Watching how Carl Lindbom fares in the SHL this season after a strong campaign last year will be exciting for the future of Vegas\\u2019 crease.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTop three prospects: William Dufour, Samuel Bolduc, Matthew Maggio\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Danny Nelson (49th overall)\\n\\nWilliam Dufour looks like a fifth round steal for the Islanders. He made his NHL debut last season thanks to a spectacular transition from junior to the AHL. Matthew Maggio looks to follow in his footsteps as another fifth round hit for the Isles. After bouncing from league to league, Ruslan Iskhakov looked like he could be nearing NHL ready up front as well. On the blueline, Samuel Bolduc had an extended NHL look last season and should be ready for a full campaign this year, while Calle Odelius was underwhelming in Sweden, but still holds potential.\\n\\nTop three prospects: Fabian Lysel, Brett Harrison, Matthew Poitras\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Christopher Pelosi (92nd overall)\\n\\nWithout Fabian Lysel, this would be a dire situation for the Bruins on the prospect front. Their draft this year was abysmal, which will certainly impact their pool further in the coming seasons. When Lysel and Jakub Lauko step to the NHL, the lone forwards trending toward the NHL in the future will be Brett Harrison and Matthew Poitras. Mason Lohrei turned pro following his NCAA career at Ohio State to end last season and should factor into the Bruins\\u2019 blue line plans at some point. Dans Locmelis is a wild card to watch as he moves from Europe to the NCAA this year.\\n\\n26. Florida Panthers\\n\\nTop three prospects: Mackie Samoskevich, Michael Benning, Grigori Denisenko\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Gracyn Sawchyn (63rd overall)\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a shallow pool in Florida, but a few recent NCAA players look like they could become steals. Mackie Samoskevich lived up to his first round selection at Michigan and turned pro at the end of the season. He\\u2019ll get a full AHL campaign in if he doesn\\u2019t make the Panthers out of camp. Perhaps the most intriguing player in Florida\\u2019s system was free agent signee Ryan Mcallister, who had 139 points in Junior A two seasons ago, piled in 49 points in 39 games as an NCAA rookie, then scored five points in five games in the AHL to finish off the year. He\\u2019s on a meteoric path. At the other end of the spectrum is Grigori Denisenko, who looks like he\\u2019s running out of chances and could become trade bait looking for a fresh start elsewhere if he doesn\\u2019t click this season in Florida. On the blue line, Michael Benning is the top prospect in the system, but if he doesn\\u2019t sign in Florida following his senior season in Denver, it would be a huge loss to the Panthers.\\n\\n25. Colorado Avalanche\\n\\nTop three prospects: Jean-Luc Foudy, Oskar Olausson, Sean Behrens\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Calum Ritchie (27th overall)\\n\\nWith the Colorado Avalanche not picking until late in the opening round of the NHL Draft, they hit a home run getting Calum Ritchie, rounded the bases, and hit another picking Mikhail Gulyayev. It was an infusion to an otherwise waning prospect pool that should give hope to Avalanche fans. Jean-Luc Foudy or Oskar Olausson could find a permanent roster spot out of camp, while Sean Behrens continues his development in the NCAA, and is a strong candidate to turn pro at the end of his season and get a handful of opportunities in Colorado. In net, Justus Annunen continues to progress and looks like he\\u2019ll be earning more NHL starts in the very near future.\\n\\nTop three prospects: Brennan Othmann, Will Cuylle, Zac Jones\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Gabe Perreault (23rd overall)\\n\\nIn terms of high-end skill up front, there\\u2019s a lot to like about New York\\u2019s prospect pool. Will Cuylle had an excellent start to his pro career with Hartford this year, earning himself a four game call up, and Brennan Othmann could do the same next year. Bryce McConnell-Barker will be back in the OHL, but took a step forward this year. How the Rangers manage Adam Sykora this season could play a major role in his future, as the Slovak came over for the AHL playoffs. And then there\\u2019s the sublimely skilled Gabriel Perreault, who can flat out score. Where the Rangers fall flat is on the blue line, where Zac Jones should stick full time on New York\\u2019s bottom pair this season, but beyond him, there is almost no one on the horizon. Thankfully for Rangers\\u2019 fans, their blue line is already young and skilled. Dylan Garand remains the team\\u2019s best netminding prospect, but only had a so-so AHL rookie campaign.\\n\\nTop three prospects: Jonathan Lekkerim\\u00e4ki, Arturs Silovs, Tom Willander\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Tom Willander (11th overall)\\n\\nAfter a horrific season for Jonathan Lekkerim\\u00e4ki, he broke out scoring a point per game in the playoffs in Allsvenskan. He\\u2019ll step up to the SHL next year, and could be a prospect needing more time than anticipated. Vancouver also acquired Aatu R\\u00e4ty and Linus Karlsson, hoping a change of scenery will help them find their stride at the NHL level. Heading into this year\\u2019s NHL Draft, the Canucks had almost no blue line prospects looking like NHL candidates. They addressed that in part by selecting Tom Willander and Hunter Brzustewicz, but remain shallow at the position outside of 2022 pick Elias Pettersson. Arturs Silovs\\u2019 World Championship MVP performance has fans hoping he\\u2019s a long term goaltending solution.\\n\\nFive Canadians teams rank in the bottom half in our ranking of the NHL's prospect pools. (Getty Images)\\n\\nTop three prospects: Connor Zary, Jakob Pelletier, Matt Coronato\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Samuel Honzek (16th overall)\\n\\nIt would be hard to point to a team who has drafted and developed worse than the Calgary Flames over the last half decade. They\\u2019ve just refused to give strong prospects a shot at the NHL, and eventually, it seems to have stunted development and confidence in many. By all rights, for a team in Calgary\\u2019s position, Connor Zary and Jakob Pelletier should be done their development path and given every opportunity in scoring roles at the NHL level. Matt Coronato may start in the AHL, but he looks close as well after a spectacular NCAA career with Harvard and a strong World Championship with Team USA. Honzek\\u2019s selection adds to this crop of forwards. Jeremie Poirier had a spectacular rookie campaign in the AHL producing well beyond expectations from the blue line. He\\u2019ll get looks this year for the Flames if he doesn\\u2019t make the team out of camp with the towering Yan Kuznetsov close behind at the AHL ranks, and Etienne Morin showing promise in the QMJHL. Dustin Wolf is the top goaltending prospect in the system and should be given more starts in the NHL this year.\\n\\n21. Ottawa Senators\\n\\nTop three prospects: Ridly Greig, Zack Ostapchuk, Tyler Boucher\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Hoyt Stanley (108th overall)\\n\\nOttawa has an abundance of youth in the NHL, so there\\u2019s no reason to panic that they\\u2019re sitting this low, and they still have a handful of meaningful prospects on the way. This should be the season we see 2020 first round pick Ridly Greig begin his full-time NHL career after he got into 20 games last season as a rookie. Other players who could be in contention for a spot up front include Zack Ostapchuk, Tyler Boucher, and Roby Jarventie, with Boucher being of special interest as the 10th overall pick in 2021. It\\u2019s time for Jacob Bernard-Docker and Lassi Thompson to claim full time spots, but they\\u2019ll be battling with another rookie, Tyler Kleven, who made his NHL debut at the end of last season after ending his NCAA career. Tomas Hamara remains a top prospect despite a step backward last season in the OHL. Their top goaltending prospect is Leevi Merilainen.\\n\\n20. Toronto Maple Leafs\\n\\nTop three prospects: Matthew Knies, Topi Niemela, Nick Robertson\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Easton Cowan (28th overall)\\n\\nKnies will be counted on to step in right away. He showed he was ready in the playoffs, although Toronto may be wise to also give him some top line starts in the AHL if their depth pushes him into a fourth line role. This season will be the year we know if Rodion Amirov\\u2019s recovery from cancer will include a future with the Maple Leafs as he\\u2019s set to suit up for his first full campaign in the KHL. Up front, it seems to be yet another make-or-break year for Nick Robertson as well, who has slid from blue-chipper to expendable. Up front, the development of Fraser Minten, Ty Voit, Nicholas Moldenhauer and Roni Hirvonen continues to trend in the right direction, while Easton Cowan, who was a shocking first round selection, will be under a microscope. On the blue line, Topi Niemela is the organization\\u2019s top prospect and will play his first full season in North America, while William Villeneuve was a pleasant surprise for the Toronto Marlies last year. The Leafs remain without a true goalie of the future in the system unless Dennis Hildeby can claim that moniker this year.\\n\\n19. Washington Capitals\\n\\nTop three prospects: Ivan Miroshnichenko, Hendrix Lapierre, Ryan Leonard\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Ryan Leonard (8th overall)\\n\\nAs Washington\\u2019s contending era ends, youth will be infused to the roster. Hendrix Lapierre had a good first full pro season, and could crack the roster next year. A wild card from the time he was picked, Ivan Miroshnichenko continues to look like his comeback story could be a success. It\\u2019s a good one-two punch, backed by the selection of Ryan Leonard and Andrew Cristall up front this season. On the back end, Ryan Chesley and Vincent Iorio are the two players to watch.\\n\\n18. Dallas Stars\\n\\nTop three prospects: Logan Stankoven, Mavrik Bourque, Lian Bichsel\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Tristan Bertucci (61st overall)\\n\\nWhether it was at the World Juniors or with the Kamloops Blazers in the WHL, Logan Stankoven was just too good for the competition. Dallas may let him learn the defensive side a bit more in the AHL, but much like Wyatt Johnson, it\\u2019s likely Stankoven can step in and contribute immediately. In his first season of professional hockey playing with Texas in the AHL, Mavrik Bourque showed he can do it at a higher level. He was good in the QMJHL, but he put together a 20-goal season as a pro rookie, and that bodes well for the future. Francesco Arcuri and Antonio Stranges round out the excitement up front. While he\\u2019s far less exciting, Lian Bichsel is not less effective. The six-foot-five blueliner will make his North American debut next season. This year\\u2019s draft hurt Dallas\\u2019 prospect pool.\\n\\n17. Los Angeles Kings\\n\\nTop three prospects: Brandt Clarke, Francesco Pinelli, Kenny Connors\\n\\nTop pick in 2023: Jakub Dvorak (54th overall)\\n\\nLA\\u2019s best young players, whether it be Quinton Byfield or Artur Kaliyev, are ready to step in. But they also bid farewell to other young players like Gabriel Vilardi and Rasmus Kupari this year. If Alex Turcotte doesn\\u2019t find his groove in the NHL, he could be the next out, but the problem is, he\\u2019s played his value down so low, that he may be an unqualified free agent at the end of the year. One thing is certain, after his nine game audition last year, Brandt Clarke will be a pro this year. He\\u2019s one of the best young offensive defenders out there. Francesco Pinelli made strides this year, and the Kings found a decent pair of prospects despite not having a first round pick this year in Jakub Dvorak and Koehn Ziemmer.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"USA Today\", \"author\": \"USA TODAY Sports\", \"title\": \"NHL offseason tracker: News, analysis on signings, trades\", \"description\": \"The first wave of NHL free agency has passed, but there still is plenty to be decided this summer.

Six-time 30-goal scorer Vladimir Tarasenko remains unsigned as are three-time Stanley Cup winners Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews. The Boston Bruins still need to learn whether Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci will return to the team or retire. Will Erik Karlsson be traded this summer? Toronto's Auston Matthews and William Nylander are among those eligible for extensions, and there are salary arbitration cases to settle.\\n\\nFollow along as USA TODAY Sports provides news and analysis on offseason transactions:\\n\\nJuly 24: Tony DeAngelo signs with Carolina Hurricanes\\n\\nDefenseman Tony DeAngelo, the lone NHL player to be bought out twice during the salary cap era, is back with the Carolina Hurricanes. He was signed to a one-year, $1.675 million contract. He's also getting nearly $1.7 million each of the next two seasons in his most recent buyout. DeAngelo, 27, played the 2021-22 season with the Hurricanes, recording 51 points after he had been bought out by the New York Rangers. Carolina traded his rights to the Philadelphia Flyers after that season and he was signed to a two-year, $10 million contract, but he was benched the final five games and bought out. He joins a deep Hurricanes blueline featuring Brent Burns, Dmitry Orlov, Jaccob Slavin, Brett Pesce and Brady Skjei. \\\"Tony is an elite offensive defenseman who had a great season with us in 2021-22,\\\" Hurricanes general manager Don Waddell said. \\u201cWe wanted to re-sign him last summer, and now we\\u2019re thrilled to bring him back to Raleigh.\\\"\\n\\nAlso: The Dallas Stars signed general manager Jim Nill to a two-year contract extension through 2025-26. He recently won GM of the year after making moves that helped the Stars reach the Western Conference final.\\n\\nJuly 23: Philipp Kurashev, Ilya Samsonov get arbitration awards\\n\\nChicago Blackhawks forward Philipp Kurashev was awarded a two-year, $4.5 million contract by an arbitrator and Toronto Maple Leafs goalie Ilya Samsonov got a reported one year at $3.55 million. Both awards were in the middle of what the two sides requested (see below) with Kurashev coming in closer to his request. The Maple Leafs are over the salary cap and will need to make moves to be compliant by the time the season starts.\\n\\nJuly 21: Kraken, Vince Dunn agree to four-year contract\\n\\nThe defenseman will average $7.35 million in the four-year deal and avoided the need for an arbitration hearing. This is the best result for both sides. In arbitration, Dunn would have received only a one-year award and then become an unrestricted free agent next summer. Instead, he gets a big raise from last year's $4 million salary and Seattle locks in its most valuable player from last season long-term. Dunn set personal bests with 14 goals, 50 assists and 64 points while playing nearly 24 minutes a game. His improvement was one of the reasons the Kraken made the playoffs in the franchise's second season.\\n\\nJuly 21: Maple Leafs, Ilya Samsonov go ahead with arbitration hearing\\n\\nFor the second consecutive day, an NHL team and player couldn't reach an early settlement and went ahead with a salary arbitration hearing. This time, it was Toronto Maple Leafs goalie Ilya Samsonov, following Chicago Blackhawks forward Philipp Kurashev the day before. Sportsnet reported that the team offered $2.4 million, while Samsonov sought $4.9 million. An arbitrator usually awards a number somewhere in the middle. Samsonov joined the Maple Leafs on a one-year, $1.8 million prove-it contract after not getting a qualifying offer from the Washington Capitals. He set career highs with 27 wins, a 2.33 goals-against average and .919 save percentage. After an initial rough outing in the playoffs, he won four of five to get the Maple Leafs to the second round for the first time since 2004. Samsonov suffered a Game 3 injury in a second-round loss to the Florida Panthers. He will get a one-year award and be an unrestricted free agent once that contract expires.\\n\\nJuly 20: Blackhawks, Philipp Kurashev go ahead with arbitration hearing\\n\\nNearly all NHL salary arbitration cases are settled early, but the Chicago Blackhawks and center Philipp Kurashev went ahead with their case on the opening day of hearings. According to The Athletic, Kurashev is seeking a one-year deal at $2.65 million and the Blackhawks are seeking a two-year deal with a $1.4 million cap hit. The arbitrator must rule within 48 hours and can choose either number or something between. Kurashev had a career-best nine goals, 16 assists and 25 points last season but also had a career-worst -32 rating on the 30th-place Blackhawks. The next scheduled hearing is with Toronto Maple Leafs goalie Ilya Samsonov on Friday.\\n\\nJuly 19: Kraken give extension to coach Dave Hakstol\\n\\nThe Vegas Golden Knights raised the bar on an expansion team's first-year expectations, so the Seattle Kraken's 60 points in their inaugural season seemed like a disappointment. But general manager Ron Francis and coach Dave Hakstol helped the team reach 100 points last season, a record 40-point improvement for a second-year team. Not only that, Seattle upset the defending champion Colorado Avalanche in the first round. The Kraken gave Hakstol, a coach of the year finalist, a two-year contract extension through the 2025-26 season.\\n\\n\\u201cDave and his staff have done a great job of creating a close-knit, team-first mindset in our locker room and their work ethic helps set the tone for our team,\\\" Francis said.\\n\\nAlso: The Winnipeg Jets agreed to a two-year, $6.875 million contract with forward Gabriel Vilardi, avoiding arbitration. He had been acquired from the Los Angeles Kings in the Pierre-Luc Dubois trade. ... The Golden Knights and forward Brett Howden also avoided arbitration, agreeing to a two-year, $3.8 million. Vegas also announced the signing of forward Pavel Dorofeyev to a one-year, $825,000 contract. ... The New Jersey Devils signed free agent forward Tomas Nosek to a one-year, $1 million contract. He played the last two seasons with the Boston Bruins, totaling 10 goals and 35 points.\\n\\nJuly 17: No. 1 overall pick Connor Bedard signs first contract\\n\\nNo. 1 overall pick Connor Bedard made it official, signing his entry-level contract on his 18th birthday with his family in attendance. There is a rookie salary cap, so the three-year deal is for $950,000 in salary and signing bonus per season, plus the potential to earn another $3.5 million a year in performance bonuses. The center, considered a generational talent, had 143 points in 57 games with the Regina Pats. The Blackhawks won the draft lottery, moving up two spots to first overall. They have recently added veterans Taylor Hall, Corey Perry and Nick Foligno.\\n\\nAlso: The Colorado Avalanche and forward Ross Colton agreed to a reported four-year, $16 million contract, avoiding arbitration. Colton, acquired from the Tampa Bay Lightning last month, got a bump from last season's $1.25 million salary. ... The Winnipeg Jets and forward Morgan Barron agreed to a two-year, $2.7 million contract, avoiding arbitration. Barron, who had been acquired from the New York Rangers in the Andrew Copp deal, had a career-best eight goals and 13 assists last season. ... Other signings: Arizona's Matias Maccelli (three years) and the New York Islanders' Oliver Wahlstrom (one year).\\n\\nJuly 16: Signings avert need for arbitration hearings\\n\\nSt. Louis Blues forward Alexey Toropchenko (two years, $2.5 million) and Minnesota Wild forward Brandon Duhaime (one year, $1.1 million) reached contract agreements four days before their scheduled salary arbitration hearings. \\\"I've only heard nightmares about arbitration, so I was really hoping it wasn't going to go there,\\\" Duhaime told reporters. \\\"I'm glad we got something done.\\\" Duhaime scored nine goals in 51 games and had a series of injuries, including crashing head first into the boards after he was cross-checked. Toropchenko had 10 goals and 19 points in 69 games in his first full season.\\n\\nJuly 15: Lightning re-sign forward Tanner Jeannot\\n\\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning were always going to get Tanner Jeannot re-signed because he was a restricted free agent and he had filed for salary arbitration. But the two sides agreed to a two-year deal with a $2.665 million cap hit on Saturday, negating the need for his scheduled July 24 hearing. He made $850,000 last season. He arrived last season from the Nashville Predators in exchange for defenseman Cal Foote and five draft picks, including a 2025 first-rounder. Jeannot is known for his rugged play and also had 24 goals in his first full season, but he scored six last season.\\n\\nJuly 14: Flyers waive Tony DeAngelo for buyout purposes\\n\\nThe Philadelphia Flyers placed defenseman Tony DeAngelo on unconditional waivers and if he passes through, he will have his contract bought out Saturday for the second time in two years. According to capfriendly.com, DeAngelo will become the first NHL player to be bought out more than once in the salary cap era. His first buyout was in 2021 by the New York Rangers, who had told him to stay home after a reported altercation with a teammate. He signed a one-year deal with the Carolina Hurricanes in 2021-22 and Flyers then-general manager Chuck Fletcher gave up three draft picks for his rights and signed him to a two-year, $10 million deal. The Flyers are buying out the contract's second year for about $3.3 million, spread over two years. Philadelphia was eligible for the league's second buyout window because Noah Cates (since signed) had filed for salary arbitration. DeAngelo hit double digits in goals last season for the third time in his career but also was suspended two games for spearing and was a healthy scratch for the final five games. He'll be a free agent after the buyout.\\n\\nAlso: The Coyotes made it official and terminated Alex Galchenyuk's contract. Galchenyuk had been arrested on July 9 and the team cited \\\"a material breach of the terms of his Standard Player's Contract.\\\" The Coyotes later announced they had signed forward Zach Sanford to a one-year, two-way deal. He played for the Nashville Predators and their American Hockey League affiliate last season.\\n\\nARREST REPORT: Police say Alex Galchenyuk made threats\\n\\nAPOLOGY: Galchenyuk apologizes for 'horrific' behavior\\n\\nJuly 13: Coyotes to terminate Alex Galchenyuk's contract\\n\\nThe Arizona Coyotes announced they were placing forward Alex Galchenyuk on unconditional waivers for the purpose of terminating his contract. He had been signed on July 1 to a one-year deal for what would have been his third stint with the team (previously 2018-19 and 2021-22). But police in Scottsdale, Arizona, said Galchenyuk had been arrested on July 9 on charges including private property hit and run, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. A department spokesperson said the hit and run involved property damage only and there were no injuries. The NHL Players' Association said it is \\\"reviewing this matter.\\\" Galchenyuk, 29, a former No. 3 overall pick who has 354 points in 654 career games, will become an unrestricted agent after his contract is terminated.\\n\\nAlso: The Dallas Stars re-signed forward Ty Dellandrea to a one-year, $900,000 contract. He had scored two goals in Game 5 of the Western Conference final against the Vegas Golden Knights.\\n\\nJuly 12: Blues bring back forward Oskar Sundqvist\\n\\nForward Oksar Sundqvist is back with the St. Louis Blues, signing a one-year, $775,000 contract. Sundqvist, 29, had been with St. Louis from 2017-22, when he was part of the package the Blues sent to the Red Wings to acquire defenseman Nick Leddy. Sundqvist spent last season with Detroit and Minnesota, totaling 10 goals and 28 points. He has won Stanley Cup titles with the Blues in 2019 and the Penguins in 2016.\\n\\nAlso: Goalie Thomas Greiss told NHL.com that he is retiring from the league after 14 seasons. ... The Arizona Coyotes signed defenseman Travis Dermott to a one-year deal. ... The Boston Bruins signed forward Jesper Boqvist to a one-year contract. He had 21 points in 70 games last season with the New Jersey Devils.\\n\\nJuly 11: Rangers re-sign defenseman K'Andre Miller\\n\\nThe New York Rangers got 23-year-old defenseman K'Andre Miller under contract for two years at a reported $3.872 million cap hit. Miller broke through with 43 points in his third season while playing nearly 22 minutes a game, second on the team behind Adam Fox. The deal leaves the Rangers with only one player left to re-sign, 2020 No. 1 overall pick Alexis Lafreniere. According to capfriendly.com, the team has a little more than $2.3 million in cap space available.\\n\\nAlso: Montreal Canadiens forward Alex Newhook, who was acquired from the Colorado Avalanche before the draft, signed a four-year contract with a $2.9 million cap hit. ... The Carolina Hurricanes signed gritty forward Brendan Lemieux to a one-year, $800,000 contract.\\n\\nJuly 10: Sharks sign forward Filip Zadina\\n\\nForward Filip Zadina, who agreed to have his contract terminated by the Red Wings, signed a one-year, $1.1 million contract with the San Jose Sharks. He would have been paid $1.83 million this upcoming season with Detroit but got out of the contract in hopes of getting more playing time. The 23-year-old, who was drafted sixth overall in 2018, played in only 30 games last season. His career best is 24 points in 2021-22.\\n\\nJuly 10: Salary arbitration hearing dates are scheduled\\n\\nSalary arbitration hearings are scheduled between July 20 and Aug. 4, though for the most part, the two sides usually reach an agreement before their hearings. The Philadelphia Flyers and center Noah Coats agreed to a two-year, $5.25 million contract on Monday, and the Boston Bruins and defenseman Ian Mitchell agreed to a one-year, $775,000 deal. Seattle Kraken defensemen Will Borgen and Cale Fleury reached deals earlier.\\n\\nJuly 20: Philipp Kurashev (Blackhawks), Brandon Duhaime (Wild), Alexey Toropchenko (Blues)\\n\\nJuly 21: Ilya Samsonov (Maple Leafs)\\n\\nJuly 24: Brett Howden (Golden Knights), Vince Dunn (Kraken), Tanner Jeannot (Lightning)\\n\\nJuly 27: Ross Colton (Avalanche)\\n\\nJuly 28: Gabriel Vilardi (Jets)\\n\\nJuly 30: Jeremy Swayman (Bruins), Jack McBain (Coyotes)\\n\\nAug. 1: Trent Frederic (Bruins)\\n\\nAug. 2: Morgan Barron (Jets), Troy Terry (Ducks)\\n\\nAug. 4: Ryan McLeod (Oilers), Brandon Scanlin (Rangers), Filip Gustavsson (Wild), Drew O'Connor (Penguins)\\n\\nJuly 9: Red Wings acquire Alex DeBrincat in trade with Senators\\n\\nThe Detroit Red Wings signed forward Alex DeBrincat to a four-year, $31.5 million extension after sending forward Dominik Kubalik, minor league defenseman Donovan Sebrango, a 2024 conditional first-round selection and a 2024 fourth-round pick to the Ottawa Senators in the trade. The one thing missing in the Red Wings' free agent acquisitions was a big-time scorer and DeBrincat, a Michigan native, has two 40-goal seasons, though he dropped to 27 in his lone season in Ottawa. The Senators had to trade DeBrincat because he wasn't going to re-sign with the team. Kubalik has averaged 20.5 goals in his career and Sebrango, an Ottawa native, split time last season between the ECHL and American Hockey League. The Red Wings can choose whether to send their first-round pick or the Top 10-protected Bruins first-rounder, which they acquired in the Bertuzzi trade.\\n\\nAlso: The Seattle Kraken and defenseman Cale Fleury agreed on a two-year, $1.6 million contract, avoiding arbitration.\\n\\nJuly 7: Filip Zadina, Red Wings agree to terminate contract\\n\\nThe Red Wings forward passed through waivers for the purpose of terminating his contract. The termination will free Detroit from the $1.825 million annual salary cap hit that would have run through 2024-25 \\u2013 but the actual salary left was $4.56 million, and that is what Zadina is willing to sacrifice for the opportunity to set his own course with a new team. Zadina, 23, has been unable to reach the hype that made him the No. 6 pick in the 2018 NHL draft, recording just 28 goals and 40 assists in 190 career games. He lacked the speed and agility to succeed in the top six, and lacked the grit and physicality to be an effective presence in the bottom six. - Helene St. James, Detroit Free Press\\n\\nAlso: The Kraken and defenseman Will Borgen agreed to a two-year, $5.4 million contract, avoiding arbitration. Borgen, who made $900,000 last season, set career bests with 20 points, 203 hits and 89 blocked shots. Seattle also signed penalty-killing forward Pierre-Eduoard Bellemare, formerly of the Lightning, for one year at $775,000. ... The Pittsburgh Penguins, who are trying to rebuild their bottom six and organizational depth, signed forwards Vinnie Hinostroza ($775,000) and Andreas Johnsson ($800,000) to one-year contracts. Hinostroza split time between the Buffalo Sabres and American Hockey League last season but has had two seasons with double digits in goals. Johnsson split time between the Devils, Sharks and AHL. He previously played for Penguins executive Kyle Dubas in Toronto.\\n\\nJuly 6: Kings extend captain Anze Kopitar\\n\\nAnze Kopitar is getting a two-year, $14 million extension from Los Angeles, starting in 2024-25. He had a $10 million cap in his contract that expires next summer. The extension was going to get done at some point, so it's good to get it out of the way before next season starts. As Kings GM Bob Blake said in a statement, Kopitar is the \\\"heart and soul\\\" of the team. He has led the Kings in scoring 15 times, including the last five seasons. He just won the Lady Byng Trophy (sportsmanship) for the second time and has won the Selke Trophy (defensive forward) and the Mark Messier Leadership Award. The two-time Stanley Cup winner has been with the Kings his entire career (17 seasons) and has been captain since 2016. He'll be 38 when the extension expires.\\n\\nAlso: The Ottawa Senators signed rugged forward Zack MacEwen to a three-year deal with a $775,000 cap hit. He has 28 regular-season fights but also had three game-winners among his four goals last season.\\n\\nJuly 5: 22 players file for salary arbitration\\n\\nThe list: Morgan Barron (Winnipeg Jets), Will Borgen (Seattle Kraken), Noah Cates (Philadelphia Flyers), Ross Colton (Colorado Avalanche), Brandon Duhaime (Minnesota Wild), Vince Dunn (Kraken), Cale Fleury (Kraken), Trent Frederic (Bruins), Filip Gustavsson (Minnesota Wild), Brett Howden (Vegas Golden Knights), Tanner Jeannot (Tampa Bay Lightning), Philipp Kurashev (Chicago Blackhawks), Jack McBain (Arizona Coyotes), Ryan McLeod (Edmonton Oilers), Ian Mitchell (Bruins), Drew O\\u2019Connor(Pittsburgh Penguins), Ilya Samsonov (Maple Leafs), Brandon Scanlin (New York Rangers), Jeremy Swayman (Bruins), Troy Terry (Anaheim Ducks), Alexei Toropchenko (St. Louis Blues), Gabriel Vilardi (Jets)\\n\\nThe most interesting cases: Dunn had a breakthrough 64-point season, and Terry has topped 60 points the past two seasons. Samsonov put up career numbers on a one-year, prove-it contract. Swayman shared the Williams Jennings Award with Vezina Trophy winner Linus Ullmark. Gustavsson had better numbers than Marc-Andre Fleury last season. The Lightning traded five draft picks and defenseman Cal Foote to acquire Jeannot last season.\\n\\nSalary arbitration hearings will be held from July 20 to Aug. 4, though teams and players usually settle beforehand.\\n\\nAlso: Tarasenko has changed agents to Creative Artists Agency, according to multiple reports. ... The New York Islanders signed forward Julien Gauthier for two years. He had played part of the past three seasons with the rival Rangers and finished last season with the Senators.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Yahoo Entertainment\", \"author\": \"The Canadian Press\", \"title\": \"Calgary Flames to retire goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff's number\", \"description\": \"CALGARY \\u2014 One of the best goaltenders in Calgary Flames' history will have his number retired by the club.

O'Reilly seems like solid value, while Schenn's three-year contract is lengthy for a player who turns 34 later this year and possesses limited speed. Getting off of half of Johansen's deal was probably the best Nashville could do. Buying out Duchene seems odd when he might've had more value than Johansen and a similar deal may have been available.\\n\\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nNone of the big moves are awful in a vacuum, but the end result is the Predators got far slower and less dangerous offensively, even with the addition of middle-six winger Gustav Nyquist.\\n\\nFilip Forsberg (9) and Roman Josi (59) will have to do some heavy lifting for the Predators next season. (Photo by Danny Murphy/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\\n\\nThe rationale for the moves also strains credulity, particularly with Schenn. Explaining his signing of the defenseman, Trotz told the following story from the 2019-20 playoff series between the New York Islanders and the Tampa Bay Lightning, when he was New York's coach:\\n\\n\\\"I thought we were starting to take the series over in the bubble. We were the physical team. We were the team that had that identity where we were getting under Tampa's skin. We were pushing some of the key guys maybe out of the series and getting momentum, and Luke was a guy that recognized that and, to me, changed the whole series. He came over and established a presence. He has a great way to identify those moments.\\\"\\n\\nThe problem with that story is the Islanders were never taking over the series, which they started 0-2 and never led. New York got as close as 2-1, but lost Game 4 by a commanding 4-1 margin.\\n\\nSchenn had literally the least per-game ice time of any player that appeared for the Lightning (10:53) in the six-game series. It would be unfair to say he had no effect, but the claim that he changed the series feels like a stretch.\\n\\nAs is the implication that a driving force behind his signing was a six-game stretch he played three years ago when he was 30.\\n\\nOn the subject of age, Trotz indicated that Johansen and Duchene didn't fit the team's window but that O'Reilly and Schenn did, which is confusing considering the new guys are older.\\n\\nNot all of Trotz's comments can be taken as precise indications of his entire thought process, but it seems clear the Predators are going all-in on intangibles and it's unclear where that's going to leave them \\u2014 particularly offensively.\\n\\nO'Reilly projects to be the Predators' top-line centre and he's coming off an age-32 season that saw him produce 0.57 points per game. Not one player on the current roster produced 20 goals last season. Filip Forsberg is likely in for a bounce-back campaign \\u2014 and there are some younger players who could step up like Luke Evangelista and Cody Glass \\u2014 but this was the 27th-ranked offence in the NHL in 2022-23. Without Duchene and Johansen, it got less explosive.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nNone of this would be much of an issue if the Predators were in the midst of a genuine rebuild, but that's not where they're at. Juuse Saros could fetch a massive haul on the trade market, but there have been no rumblings of the star goaltender going anywhere in the last two years of his contract.\\n\\nRoman Josi remains one of the NHL's top defenseman, but he's 33. With a no-movement clause in hand he doesn't seem to be going anywhere, which means there's pressure to win while he's around. The team traded for 34-year-old defensive stalwart Ryan McDonaugh just over a year ago. This isn't a teardown job.\\n\\nBased on how the Predators are behaving, they ought to be judged on their ability to win now. Unless Saros plays out of his mind, it's hard to see that happening in 2023-24. O'Reilly and Schenn aren't bad players, but it's tough to envision them moving the needle in a profound way \\u2014 and they seem to have been targeted for reasons only tangentially connected to on-ice success.\\n\\nAfter all, having that pair of \\\"serial winners\\\" around didn't catapult the Toronto Maple Leafs to a championship in 2022-23, even if they'd both hoisted the Cup before.\\n\\nRight now it seems like the plan in Nashville is to cultivate a constructive atmosphere to bring young players along over time while doing some winning along the way. The Predators may achieve the first goal in part due to their new signings, but the second one could be out of their reach.\\n\\nWith at least $8.805 million in dead money on their cap in each of the next three years \\u2014 largely due to the Johansen and Duchene moves \\u2014 it's not going to be easy for Trotz to maximize the Josi-Saros window, no matter how many \\\"winners\\\" he gets.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"NBCSports.com\", \"author\": \"NBC Sports\", \"title\": \"Short contracts and bonus money prove to be popular in NHL free agency this year\", \"description\": \"Max Pacioretty was in a unique, if not uncomfortable spot going into NHL free agency coming off tearing his right Achilles tendon twice in the past year.\", \"url\": \"https://www.nbcsports.com/nhl/news/short-contracts-and-bonus-money-prove-to-be-popular-in-nhl-free-agency-this-year\", \"text\": \"Max Pacioretty was in a unique, if not uncomfortable spot going into NHL free agency coming off tearing his right Achilles tendon twice in the past year.\\n\\nTurns out it was just the right time to hit the market.\\n\\nThe post-pandemic hockey landscape meant another year with just a $1 million increase to the salary cap, but everyone in the league knows it\\u2019s set for a big leap next summer.

Since Tavares joined the team in 2018-19, the Maple Leafs' power play ranks fourth in the NHL, scoring on 24.0% of its opportunities.\\n\\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nIn the last two seasons they've been even better, finishing first or second in the NHL in power-play efficiency during both campaigns and posting the two highest PP% marks in franchise history.\\n\\nThe Maple Leafs have all of the ingredients for a top-notch power play, but the unit may have a different flavour in 2023-24. (Andr\\u00e9 Ringuette/NHLI via Getty Images)\\n\\nThat record doesn't suggest the Maple Leafs need to overhaul what they do with the man advantage, but it looks like a mini shakeup is coming their way \\u2014 for better or worse.\\n\\nThe new sheriff in town\\n\\nWhile the Maple Leafs retained bench boss Sheldon Keefe, the assistant coach most responsible for the team's elite power play over the last two years \\u2014 Spencer Carbery \\u2014 has moved on to Washington. While Carbery had excellent ingredients to work with, Toronto's best special teams unit was spectacular under his watch.\\n\\nOn Thursday, the Maple Leafs announced Carbery's replacement, Guy Boucher.\\n\\nThe 51-year-old former coach of the Ottawa Senators and Tampa Bay Lightning held down an NHL coaching role for six seasons. Here's how his teams fared on the power play in those years, with their 5-on-5 goal ranking to give a sense of the offensive talent on the squads in question:\\n\\nVia NHL.com\\n\\nThere are plenty of variables at play here, including the assistants under Boucher during his two head-coaching stints. That said, there isn't much evidence to suggest the newest member of Toronto's staff can elevate the success of power-play units above their expected output.\\n\\nBecause the Maple Leafs were so successful under Carbery, hiring an upgrade always seemed more or less out of the question. Boucher's track record doesn't suggest he's the guy to find another level for this already-elite unit.\\n\\nFrom a stylistic standpoint, one thing that stands out about the power plays that Boucher presided over in the past is that they tended to have a scoring focal point.\\n\\nDuring his three years in Tampa Bay, Steven Stamkos scored almost twice as many power-play goals (39) as the team's second-best power-play scorer, Vincent Lecavalier (22). The same was true in Ottawa with Mike Hoffman (21) easily topping Matt Duchene (13) as the top threat.\\n\\nUnder Carbery's guidance over the last two years, Matthews (29) and Tavares (28) have shared the scoring load with Nylander not too far behind (22). With Boucher in the mix it's possible the Maple Leafs try to funnel a higher percentage of the looks to Matthews.\\n\\nAlthough Rielly is a competent power-play quarterback \\u2014 and the Maple Leafs know that he works well alongside their top four forwards \\u2014 there's an argument to be made for installing Klingberg as the sole defenceman on their first unit.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nMuch of what makes Rielly effective as an offensive player is his ability to join the rush, a willingness to carry the puck to dangerous areas, and an accurate wrist shot. Those are good qualities, but they aren't always applicable as a power-play point man, which often leaves Rielly as a pure facilitator.\\n\\nKlingberg offers a bit more of a threat from the point as he carries a heavier shot than Rielly. His career shooting percentage (6.6%) is significantly better than Rielly's (4.7%), and he's scored eight more goals than the longtime Maple Leaf in 98 fewer games.\\n\\nThe veteran Swede is also more potent from long range as he has almost four times as many slap-shot goals in his career (15) than Rielly (4), who almost never lights the lamp on plays like this:\\n\\nJohn Klingberg winds up and cranks the slap shot past Allen, restoring Anaheim's lead in the third!#FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/TYpx7QpK4F \\u2014 Hockey Daily 365 l NHL Highlights (@HockeyDaily365) December 16, 2022\\n\\nThat's not the type of shot the Maple Leafs power play should be built around, but it's something that teams have to account for when Klingberg is on the ice. Because Tavares is one of the best puck deflectors in the NHL, having a defenceman who is more of a threat to shoot from the point could have its advantages.\\n\\nComparing Klingberg and Rielly, it's clear the former has been more dynamic on a per-60 basis over the course of his career.\\n\\nVia NHL.com\\n\\nDespite those numbers, there's still a strong case to be made for Rielly. It's possible the Maple Leafs are best served by a defenceman who plays a supporting role on the power play and lets the forwards dominate the puck.\\n\\nKlingberg would bring a different element, but it remains to be seen if it's an element this group needs.\\n\\nThe new forwards\\n\\nWhile the forwards on the team's top unit may seem locked in, the team's willingness to experiment with Ryan O'Reilly on PP1 last season showed that mixing things up isn't out of the question.\\n\\nTyler Bertuzzi was a power-play force in his playoff cameo with the Boston Bruins and Max Domi got 36.7% of his points with the man advantage in a featured offensive role with the Chicago Blackhawks last season.\\n\\nIt will be tough for either forward to break through unless the team needs a shakeup because what each does best could be considered redundant with a higher-profile Maple Leaf. Bertuzzi is an excellent netfront presence, but it'd be hard to argue that he's better than Tavares. Domi is an underrated setup man, but he's no Marner.\\n\\nBertuzzi is more likely to break through if the Maple Leafs deploy Tavares in more of a bumper role with Matthews and Marner on the sides and a defenceman at the point. That could give the new Maple Leaf a chance to do his thing in front of the net and bump Nylander down to PP2. In a world where Nylander gets traded, that's also the most logical configuration.\\n\\nEven if the Maple Leafs go with a Core Four plus Rielly/Klingberg as the first unit, Bertuzzi and Domi figure to anchor the second group. Last season the players outside of Matthews, Marner, Nylander and Tavares who got the most power-play time were Michael Bunting, Rasmus Sandin, Calle Jarnkrok, Alexander Kerfoot and Pierre Engvall. Only Jarnkrok remains with the team.\\n\\nWhile upgrading on 2022-23's PP1 would be tough to do, PP2 is shaping up to be more potent. The Maple Leafs will be able to feature Bertuzzi, Domi, whichever defenceman isn't on the first unit and some combination of Jarnkrok, Matthew Knies and Nick Robertson.\\n\\nHowever that group shakes out, it has some potential \\u2014 thanks in large part to Bertuzzi and Domi.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Tennessean\", \"author\": \"The Tennessean\", \"title\": \"Explaining Nashville Predators' free-agent signings \\u2013 and what Barry Trotz said about them\", \"description\": \"What Nashville Predators GM Barry Trotz had to say about Ryan O'Reilly, Luke Schenn and Gustav Nyquist, a breakdown of the deals and their roles\", \"url\": \"https://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/nhl/predators/2023/07/01/barry-trotz-nashville-predators-nhl-free-agent-signings-ryan-oreilly-luke-schenn-gustav-nyquist/70376119007/\", \"text\": \"Your subscription supports:\\n\\nImpactful insider coverage of Nashville politics that keeps the government in check.\\n\\nJournalism that makes our home better by celebrating the good, solving the bad, and investigating the ugly.\\n\\nMusic city coverage and what it means for Nashvillians (transplants and unicorns alike).

On a rebuilding team, he has potential to be a veteran presence higher in the lineup, capable of producing at a steady clip.\\n\\nHis playoff record might devalue him slightly as a midseason trade asset, but anything he'd fetch would be a nice bonus.\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 26\\n\\nPosition: LD/RD\\n\\n2022-23 team: Chicago Blackhawks\\n\\nReasons he's still available: Jones provides almost nothing offensively, and even when he was given a career-high 113:24 of power-play ice time in 2022-23, he produced just four points with it.\\n\\nThe Blackhawks shouldn't be in the business of expelling young talent and they did not give him a qualifying offer. Getting castoffs from Chicago isn't generally a winning strategy.\\n\\nWhat role he can play: Third-pairing defenceman with some flexibility\\n\\nPart of what makes Jones interesting is that he played a variety of roles in Chicago. He wasn't well-suited to all of them, but the fact he has experience playing on both sides is handy \\u2014 and he logged some first-pair time as well, getting 21:06 per night in the last 27 games of the season.\\n\\nThat doesn't make him a star, but he's tended to handle himself in most scenarios. Jones has a positive relative Corsi in each of his five NHL seasons, including a strong +4.8% mark last year with Chicago. In a smaller role than played in 2022-23, he's likely to provide some quality minutes.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 27\\n\\nPosition: LW/C\\n\\n2022-23 team: Detroit Red Wings\\n\\nReasons he's still available: Suter has flashed intriguing offensive skill throughout his career, but it's telling that he's never secured a top-six role despite playing for subpar teams in Chicago and Detroit.\\n\\nAlthough he's been a centre at times, he's not much of a faceoff man in his career (46.7%) and his possession metrics have been precisely in line with his teams in the past \\u2014 indicating that he's not a noteworthy play driver.\\n\\nWhat role he can play: Provider of bottom-six juice\\n\\nWhile Suter's inability to earn more prominent roles is a red flag, he has done an admirable job under the ice-time constraints he's dealt with.\\n\\nIn each of the last three seasons, he's scored either 14 or 15 goals, which is solid output from a bottom-six player. He's a threat off the rush, which is handy when playing with linemates less likely to sustain possession and make intricate passing plays.\\n\\nPius Suter goes short side with a sweet shorty. \\ud83d\\udc19 pic.twitter.com/fxCYbzaa7n \\u2014 NHL (@NHL) November 5, 2022\\n\\nPlenty of teams could use some offence lower in their lineups, and Suter can help in that regard.\\n\\nDennis Malgin\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 26\\n\\nPosition: RW\\n\\n2022-23 teams: Toronto Maple Leafs/Colorado Avalanche\\n\\nWhat are the warts: Malgin is a player who demonstrates flashes of brilliance but struggles to find consistency. He's had a few shots to establish himself as a productive NHLer, and 2022-23 is the closest he's come.\\n\\nSome teams may see a player who's time has come and gone, and he has minimal special-teams experience at the NHL level.\\n\\nWhat role he can play: Middle-six scorer\\n\\nIt's not hard to see the potential in Malgin as an offensive spark plug. After the 2019-20 season, the winger had two stellar years in Switzlerland with 94 points in 93 games and his return to the NHL included some strong moments.\\n\\nAre you kidding me Denis Malgin? \\ud83d\\ude31 pic.twitter.com/uF2cehwH4H \\u2014 Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) February 26, 2023\\n\\nHe can carry the puck effectively and he's posted a positive relative Corsi in his last four NHL seasons, despite playing on strong teams with a healthy baseline.\\n\\nMalgin also does an excellent job of finding his own shot as his shots/60 at 5-on-5 (9.47) ranked 62nd in the NHL last year. Directly above him were Roman Josi, Martin Necas and Travis Konecny. Below were Dylan Cozens, Evgeni Malkin, and Chris Kreider.\\n\\nThere's offence in Malgin to be unlocked under the right circumstances.\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 24\\n\\nPosition: RD\\n\\n2022-23 teams: Tampa Bay Lightning/Nashville Predators\\n\\nWhat are the warts: Foote has disappointed at the NHL level since breaking through as a top prospect with the Lightning.\\n\\nNashville choosing not to give him a qualifying offer is a red flag \\u2014 as is the fact his offensive production is virtually nonexistent. For a guy his size (6-foot-5, 225 pounds), he doesn't throw the body around much, either.\\n\\nWhat role he can play: Third-pairing defenceman\\n\\nFoote might be a bust when it's all said and done, but it's too soon to know, and he's an interesting post-hype sleeper for a rebuilding club to take a shot on.\\n\\nHis size is rare, he can move, and he has a heavy shot, even if he seldom uses it.\\n\\nCal Foote doing BIG things for the @TBLightning!\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch on on FOX Sports Sun & FOX Sports Go: https://t.co/5VK16FYvqd#GoBolts pic.twitter.com/yXoig9PFD4 \\u2014 Bally Sports Sun: Lightning (@BallyLightning) January 31, 2021\\n\\nWhile he's not always throwing massive hits, he has been willing to drop the gloves in the past, which might appeal to some teams looking for toughness.\\n\\nSigning Foote would be a speculative play, but big right-shot defenders with potential are rarely available in the bargain bin.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Nbcsportsboston.com\", \"author\": \"NBC Sports Boston\", \"title\": \"5 winners, losers from Round One of 2023 NHL Draft\", \"description\": \"The Chicago Blackhawks got their man in Connor Bedard, but did the Anaheim Ducks stumble?

Fortunately for Columbus, Anaheim's decision to pass on Fantilli made the Blue Jackets' job much easier.\\n\\nFantilli, boasting a 6-foot-2, 195-pound frame, has immense physical strength that doesn't hinder his speed when skating around the ice. The Michigan product recorded 1.81 points per game as a freshman, the most by a draft-eligible player since Paul Kariya in 1992-93.\\n\\nHis output is already solid for his age, but considering his mechanics and shot angles could benefit from enhancing, Fantilli falling to the No. 3 overall pick was an unbelievably colossal win for the Blue Jackets.\\n\\nLoser: Trades\\n\\nGeneral managers on Wednesday didn't have much to do besides making selections.\\n\\nIn terms of draft-night trades, there were none.

Compher and three-time winner Patrick Kane are among the players available in the free agent market, which lost a top option Wednesday when Ivan Barbashev re-signed with Vegas.\\n\\nThe 2023 free agent class includes a handful of intriguing veteran goaltenders and not a lot of top-tier defensemen.\\n\\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nHere's a look at the top free agents by position:\\n\\nFORWARDS\\n\\nALEX KILLORN\\n\\nComing off setting career highs with 27 goals, 37 assists and 64 points, Killorn could get the highest salary of any player who reaches unrestricted free agency. He helped the Tampa Bay Lightning win the Cup back to back in 2020 and '21 and reach the final in 2022, playing a key role during each run.\\n\\nKillorn also turns 34 before opening night and plays a heavy style of game. Still, he's a proven winner, much like former teammate Ondrej Palat, who cashed in last summer with a $30 million, five-year contract.\\n\\nJ.T. COMPHER\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe Avalanche would love to bring back Compher, a versatile 28-year-old forward who can play center and wing and is coming off a career year with 52 points. They have some extra cap space to use because captain Gabriel Landeskog will likely spend the entire season on long-term injured reserve following knee cartilage replacement surgery.\\n\\nPlus, Colorado traded restricted free agent forward Alex Newhook to Montreal on Tuesday, so perhaps there is a road back for Compher. If not, he'll be well compensated on the open market.\\n\\nPATRICK KANE\\n\\nThe second-most prolific scorer among U.S.-born players is the most accomplished star available. He has won the Cup three times with Chicago.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nBut Kane is 34 and could miss several months recovering from hip resurfacing surgery, which only Washington's Nick Backstrom and one other player have come back from. Kane figures to be the perfect veteran addition for a growing team ready to take that next step.\\n\\nJONATHAN TOEWS\\n\\nA longtime teammate of Kane's in Chicago, Toews and the Blackhawks are parting ways after 15 seasons. Now 35, Toews could be a depth center helping a contending team chase a championship.\\n\\nPittsburgh could be a fit, if Toews and Sidney Crosby want to play together in the NHL after winning two Olympic gold medals together for Canada.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDEFENSEMEN\\n\\nDMITRY ORLOV\\n\\nAnother Cup winner (from the Capitals in 2018), Orlov made himself some real money with an impressive couple of months in Boston following a trade from Washington. After 19 points in 43 games with the Capitals, Orlov had 17 in 23 the remainder of the regular season with the Bruins.\\n\\nHe's soon to be 32, so he might not get the maximum eight-year deal. But it's not out of the realm of possibility to imagine $36 million for Orlov over six seasons.\\n\\nOLIVER EKMAN-LARSSON\\n\\nThe 31-year-old Swede wasn't supposed to be a free agent for four more summers. Then the Vancouver Canucks bought him out and put an intriguing player into the pool.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nEkman-Larsson has not been at his best in recent years, but the right opportunity could allow him to recapture some of his past success.\\n\\nGOALTENDERS\\n\\nFREDERIK ANDERSEN\\n\\nOn the verge of turning 33, Andersen has taken three different organizations to the playoffs over his lengthy career. He was good for Carolina this past spring, going 5-3 with a 1.83 goals-against average and .927 save percentage.\\n\\nAndersen could return to the Hurricanes, but they may be in the market for a change in net. Pyotr Kochetkov is 24 and the future. Andersen can still help a contender win.\\n\\nTRISTAN JARRY\\n\\nAn All-Star in 2022 with Pittsburgh, Jarry is just 28 and might still have the potential to be an above-average NHL starter. The Penguins are firmly in win-now mode with Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang under contract, so they might swing big for a goalie via trade.\\n\\nJarry is younger than Andersen and Antti Raanta and may be in line for a nice payday elsewhere.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Nbcsportsbayarea.com\", \"author\": \"NBC Sports BayArea\", \"title\": \"2023 NHL Draft: Five winners, losers from first round\", \"description\": \"The Chicago Blackhawks got their man in Connor Bedard, but did the Anaheim Ducks stumble?

That's not inaccurate, or even inherently disingenuous.\\n\\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nWhere it's easy for wires to cross is the way we are conditioned to take the term 'favourite' and associate it with 'best team' or 'team most likely to win' \\u2014 and that's not always the case. Sportsbooks set lines with probabilities in mind, sure, but that's not all that's going on.\\n\\nIf they made the Arizona Coyotes the favourite to win the Stanley Cup, no one would bet on them so it would be a waste of time. If they offered the Colorado Avalanche as a +300,000 underdog to win it all, they'd put themselves in the position to lose buckets of money on an outcome that could easily come to pass.\\n\\nThat said, the goal of a sportsbook is to induce as much betting as it can without over-leveraging itself on a particular outcome. It is not designed to tell the future.\\n\\nThe Maple Leafs are a good team, but they are plenty of squads with a better chance to win the Stanley Cup. (Matt Carlson/Getty Images)\\n\\nSo, when the Maple Leafs appear as a Stanley Cup favourite, it's because sportsbooks know they don't have to offer value in line with the team's chances of winning to receive plenty of bets.\\n\\nToronto has a massive fanbase, some of whom will want to bet on the team to win it all no matter what. This trend is heightened by the fact the team hasn't won a Cup since 1967. Holding a ticket on the team's drought-breaking season could be an appealing prospect for some.\\n\\nIt's also no secret that the Maple Leafs receive a disproportionate amount of media coverage.\\n\\nThe combination of the large audience for content around the team \\u2014 and the fact that Canadian sports media outlets tend to be headquartered in Toronto \\u2014 often makes the club top of mind for NHL fans, whether they like it or not. That level of visibility probably also attracts some betting action.\\n\\nNow, for the Maple Leafs to get favourite status, they still have to be plausible champions in 2023-24, and they certainly meet that threshold. Toronto tied the Vegas Golden Knights for the fourth-highest point total in the 2022-23 regular season with 111. The year before, the team ranked fourth with 115.\\n\\nToronto also finally got over the hump in the playoffs, defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round. You could make an argument that they improved the roster by adding Tyler Bertuzzi, Max Domi, and John Klingberg on prove-it one-year contracts.\\n\\nDespite that, there are a few teams that simply have to be considered more likely to win a championship than Toronto in 2023-24.\\n\\nThe Golden Knights matched Toronto's regular season and just won it all. They were surprisingly able to bring back Ivan Barbashev and Adin Hill, leaving Rielly Smith as the team's only major departure.\\n\\nThe Carolina Hurricanes won more games than the Maple Leafs during the 2022-23 season, and advanced further in the playoffs. Their free-agent shopping spree included adding the top defenceman on the market \\u2014 Dmitry Orlov \\u2014 and former Maple Leaf Michael Bunting. They look like they are nearing a deal for Vladimir Taransenko and may still be in the market to trade for Erik Karlsson.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe New Jersey Devils had a better point total than Toronto, and went just as far in the playoffs. Much of the team's young core is improving and they locked in Jesper Bratt and Timo Meier on big extensions, while acquiring Tyler Toffoli via trade. It would be hard to argue Toronto is better than New Jersey.\\n\\nColorado also deserve a mention on a list of teams that clearly have a better shot than Toronto. The team made some excellent moves prior to free agency, added some depth in the open market, and should have plenty of cap room for additional upgrades if they put Gabriel Landeskog's $7 million cap hit on LTIR.\\n\\nThose cases don't seem particularly debatable, and depending on how you evaluate clubs like the Edmonton Oilers, Dallas Stars, or Boston Bruins, projecting them to have a better chance to win than Toronto is reasonable. Impassioned arguments could conceivably be made for a few other squads, too.\\n\\nThe Maple Leafs are a really good hockey team with a real chance to win the Stanley Cup in 2023-24 \\u2014 just like they've had a legitimate shot the last few years. Even so, being the best squad in a 32-team league is a tall order, and Toronto does not meet that criteria at the moment.\\n\\nThe favourite label is a mechanism designed to divert bets in the direction that sportsbooks want it to go, at values that they are comfortable with. It does not indicate who will win. Whatever the odds have to say about the Toronto Maple Leafs, they don't look like the best the NHL has to offer.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Yahoo Entertainment\", \"author\": \"Nick Ashbourne\", \"title\": \"How close are the new-look Flames to winning?\", \"description\": \"With the departures of Matthew Tkachuk and Johnny Gaudreau, Calgary is in the midst of a new era as it looks to end its championship drought.\", \"url\": \"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/state-of-the-stanley-cup-drought-how-close-are-the-new-look-flames-to-winning-204716317.html\", \"text\": \"With the departures of Matthew Tkachuk and Johnny Gaudreau, Calgary is in the midst of a new era as it looks to end its championship drought.\\n\\nThis is Part 4 of a 10-part series examining the longest Stanley Cup droughts in the NHL, and how close teams are to breaking through for their first championship in decades \\u2014 or ever.\\n\\nPrevious articles: Senators, Sharks, Oilers\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nAfter relocating from Atlanta, the Calgary Flames hit the ground running in their new home with nine consecutive seasons making the playoffs, 12 series wins, and a Stanley Cup victory in 1988-89.\\n\\nThat level of success has been more difficult to attain in recent decades, and the Flames currently find themselves in a state of upheaval.\\n\\nFollowing the 2021-22 season, a Flames team that put up 111 points in the regular season lost Johnny Gaudreau to free agency, and honoured Matthew Tkachuk's request for a trade out of town.\\n\\nThe new-look group led by the main piece in the Tkachuk trade \\u2014 Jonathan Huberdeau \\u2014 and free-agent signing Nazem Kadri produced just 93 points and missed the postseason.

The Flames rank 12th in the NHL in points (2,792) since their last title in 1988-89, but have just six playoff series wins during that time \\u2014 one of which was a best-of-five victory during a 2019-20 season derailed by COVID-19.\\n\\nLosing in the first round has been the norm for the franchise, as they've done so 12 times since earning their last championship. It's not as if the Flames have iced regular-season juggernauts that have found ways to disappoint in the playoffs, either.\\n\\nCalgary have produced just three squads that have topped 100 points in a season since 1989. Their best regular-season team was the 2021-22 group (111 points) that got disassembled the following offseason.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThat state of continually bowing out early in the playoffs and often being expected to do so means that the Flames have fewer what-if moments than a number of clubs facing similar Cup droughts.\\n\\nThe one they do have is tough to stomach, though.\\n\\nHow does Calgary's championship prognosis look now?\\n\\nNot great.\\n\\nIf you're looking to feel optimistic about the Flames, you could say that the team posted excellent underlying numbers in 2022-23 despite missing the playoffs. Only one team had a larger share of shots on net at 5-on-5 than Calgary last season, and just two had a higher percentage of expected goals.\\n\\nFiring Darryl Sutter seems like a step in the right direction if the number of players who reportedly rescinded trade requests as a result is any indication.\\n\\nIf Jacob Markstr\\u00f6m can rebound from a difficult season between the pipes and Calgary gets more shooting luck, they're not far from being a successful team.\\n\\nAll of that said, the Flames also traded leading scorer Tyler Toffoli for a winger in Yegor Sharangovich who is coming off an uninspiring campaign and seems unlikely to replicate Toffoli's production.\\n\\nThe team also has a massive group of players who could become unrestricted free agents after 2023-24 that includes Elias Lindholm, Mikael Backlund, Noah Hanifin, Chris Tanev, and Nikita Zadorov. It would surprise no one if a number of those players were moved in the lead up to the season.\\n\\nEven if they all stay, and many depart after 2023-24, Calgary could be looking at a reset. There is a theoretical version of the Flames that could be good this year, but it's tough to see that coming about \\u2014 and even if everything breaks right, they'd project to be more solid than spectacular.\\n\\nThat means this drought doesn't look like it'll come to an end in the immediate future, and the longer-term prognosis for this franchise is tough to pin down.\\n\\nIts prospect pool isn't particularly well-regarded, but if the team does end up holding a mini veteran fire sale, it has a chance to build a bigger stash of young players and picks than it has today.\\n\\nCalgary seems to be an extremely successful rebuild away from threatening to win a Stanley Cup, but that rebuild hasn't really started yet \\u2014 and may be tough to execute around Huberdeau and Kadri.\\n\\nIf the Flames opt for more of a retool, it will be very difficult to find their out from the middle of the pack, a spot they've become all-too-familiar with over the years.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"SNY.tv\", \"author\": \"SNY\", \"title\": \"Rangers 2023 free agency preview: Breaking down the Blueshirts\\u2019 internal and external options\", \"description\": \"With free agency kicking off this weekend, let's take a look at some internal and external options for the Rangers to consider...\", \"url\": \"https://sny.tv/articles/rangers-2023-free-agency-preview-internal-external-options\", \"text\": \"Owned and operated by SportsNet New York, part of the SNY Blog Network.

The coaching carousel has spun and a number of significant trades have been made.\\n\\nThose moves stole some of the spotlight from a fairly weak free agent class, but plenty of impact players still hit the market on July 1.\\n\\nYou may notice some names absent from this list, specifically Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci. We've left that duo out as they appear likely to play for the Bruins or retire. Similarly, Jordan Staal re-signed with the Hurricanes prior to free agency opening.\\n\\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nWithout further ado, here are the 30 top NHL free agents on the market this summer, and where they landed if they've already signed.\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 32\\n\\nPosition: LD\\n\\n2022-23 team(s): Washington Capitals/Boston Bruins\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 66 GP, 7 G, 29 A, 36 P, 52.9% CF\\n\\nSummary: Orlov is not a particularly splashy name for the top of this list, but he's the kind of defenseman who could make any team better. He produces a respectable amount of offense, moves the puck effectively, throws his 5-foot-11, 214-pound frame around, posts solid possession stats and skates 22 minutes per night.\\n\\nHe's on the wrong side of 30, but he showed no signs of slowing down last year and defensemen of his size often age gracefully as their physicality doesn't fade. Top-pair defenders are hard to come by and Orlov fits that description.\\n\\nUpdate: Orlov signed a two-year, $15.5 million contract with the Hurricanes.\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 28\\n\\nPosition: LW\\n\\n2022-23 team: Detroit Red Wings/Boston Bruins\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 50 GP, 8 G, 22 A, 30 P, 52.5% CF\\n\\nSummary: Bertuzzi's regular-season numbers don't jump off the page, but he was a 30-goal scorer in 2021-22 and his 10-point tour de force in the first round of the playoffs will be in every GM's mind when they approach his agent.\\n\\nIt's hard to find a top-line calibre player under the age of 30 in free agency and Bertuzzi is capable of getting on the scoresheet and under his opponents' skin. He's no Matthew Tkachuk, but you can see shades of the Florida Panthers superstar in his ability to get physical and fill the net.\\n\\nUpdate: Bertuzzi signed a one-year, $5.5 million contract with the Maple Leafs.\\n\\n3. Ryan O'Reilly\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 32\\n\\nPosition: C\\n\\n2022-23 team(s): St. Louis Blues/Toronto Maple Leafs\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 53 GP, 16 G, 14 A, 30 P, 49.6% CF\\n\\nSummary: O'Reilly's 2022-23 did not go as planned due to injury issues, but he remains a strong two-way center capable of thriving in a second-line role. He produced 20 points in 24 games after joining Toronto last season, and added another nine points in 11 playoff games.\\n\\nIf you're interested in intangibles, O'Reilly has you covered as a former captain with extensive playoff experience. His trophy case includes a Conn Smythe Trophy, Selke Trophy and Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. He's no longer at the height of his powers, but he's not far off.\\n\\nUpdate: O'Reilly signed a four-year, $18-million contract with the Predators\\n\\nRyan O'Reilly is among the top NHL free agents available this summer.

Even so, it's tough to ignore that the star winger is just a year removed from a 92-point campaign and has a higher offensive ceiling than anyone else on this list.\\n\\nIt's tough to gauge his chances of reaching that ceiling, but it's possible that he was on cruise control with a brutal Blackhawks team before struggling to get acclimated to life with the Rangers last year. A bounce-back season isn't out of the question in the right situation.\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 29\\n\\nPosition: RD\\n\\n2022-23 team: Minnesota Wild\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 79 GP, 4 G, 10 A, 14 P, 49.0% CF\\n\\nSummary: Dumba's stock isn't as high as it was when his offensive production was more consistent, but he still checks plenty of boxes for NHL teams. He's a right-shot defenseman under the age of 30 who can skate top-pair minutes, kill penalties and even fill in on the power play as needed.\\n\\nThe Wild have used him in more of a shutdown role in recent years, but another team may see a little more offensive upside in Dumba. While his goal totals have been in decline lately, he still flashes intriguing skill at times and a change of scenery might help him after spending years at the forefront of trade rumors.\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 27\\n\\nPosition: LW\\n\\n2022-23 team(s): St. Louis Blues/Vegas Golden Knights\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 16 G, 29 A, 45 P, 45.8% CF\\n\\nSummary: Like Bertuzzi, Barbashev stands to cash in on his work in the playoffs. The winger was productive on Jack Eichel's flank for the Golden Knights, making the case that he can be deployed as a first-line winger for a contender.\\n\\nBarbashev has youth and recent production on his side, plus a little size (6-1, 195) and a willingness to throw some hits. Getting the label of \\\"winning player\\\" will help his bottom line, as will the fact he'll make a better long-term investment than most of the guys available.\\n\\nUpdate: Barbashev signed a five-year, $25-million deal to remain with the Vegas Golden Knights.\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 34\\n\\nPosition: LW\\n\\n2022-23 team: Tampa Bay Lightning\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 27 G, 37 A, 64 P, 50.7% CF\\n\\nSummary: No available player produced more points than Killorn in 2022-23, who comes with plenty of playoff pedigree after winning two Stanley Cups with the Tampa Bay Lightning.\\n\\nHis age will justifiably scare off some suitors, but he's a versatile player who plays both special teams and does just about everything well. He's also missed just four games since 2015-16, suggesting durability should be less of an issue with him than it is for most players his age.\\n\\nUpdate: Killorn signed a four-year, $25 million deal with the Ducks.\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 32\\n\\nPosition: RW\\n\\n2022-23 team(s): St. Louis Blues/New York Rangers\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 69 GP, 18 G, 32 A, 50 P, 45.7% CF\\n\\nSummary: There are age and durability concerns with Tarasenko, but he remains a talented scorer capable of conjuring moments of brilliance.\\n\\nOh my, what a goal by Tarasenko pic.twitter.com/WqXC4hKihR \\u2014 Habs Fan TV (@habsfantv_) March 3, 2023\\n\\nHe's also just one year removed from a 34-goal season and in the right situation he might be able to recapture that magic. Tarasenko probably needs a skilled pass-first linemate or two \\u2014 and some power-play time \\u2014 to reach his full potential, but he still looks like a capable trigger man.\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 28\\n\\nPosition: C/LW\\n\\n2022-23 team: Chicago Blackhawks/Dallas Stars\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 20 G, 36 A, 56 P, 45.0% CF\\n\\nSummary: Domi got a chance to thrive in a massive role with the lowly Blackhawks for most of 2022-23 before becoming a critical mid-season addition for the Stars.\\n\\nHe has plenty of role versatility, provides an offensive spark and possesses the kind of sandpaper to him that many GMs value. The way he's bounced around the NHL in recent years might be a red flag for some, but top-six quality players under 30 aren't easy to come by in free agency.\\n\\nUpdate: Domi signed a one-year, $3 million deal with the Maple Leafs.\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 28\\n\\nPosition: C\\n\\n2022-23 team: Colorado Avalanche\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 17 G, 35 A, 52 P, 51.3% CF\\n\\nSummary: Compher took on a huge role with the Avalanche in 2022-23, playing both special teams and skating 20:32 per night \\u2014 the 14th-highest total among all forwards.\\n\\nThat doesn't make him a superstar, but a do-it-all second-line center who is a couple years from his 30th birthday is a valuable asset. The biggest concern with Compher is that he'd never produced 33 points in a season prior to 2022-23.\\n\\nTeams might be wary about paying for the player he was last season when he's spent most of his career producing at a middle-six level.\\n\\nUpdate: Compher signed a five-year, $25.5 million deal with the Red Wings\\n\\nMichael Bunting has scored 46 goals over the past two seasons. (Mark Blinch/Getty Images)\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 28\\n\\nPosition: LW\\n\\n2022-23 team: Toronto Maple Leafs\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 23 G, 26 A, 49 P, 51.9% CF\\n\\nSummary: Bunting is a tough player to put a price tag on. The winger is coming off two consecutive 23-goal seasons, but he's done a lot of his damage skating alongside Auston Matthews on Toronto's top line.\\n\\nIt's unclear what he can do in a smaller role or if he would be worth his price tag if he's not skating with top dogs. Despite the questions around him, he's relatively young and knows how to score. That combo is worth plenty to NHL teams.\\n\\nUpdate: Bunting signed a three-year, $13.5 million deal with the Hurricanes.\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 28\\n\\nPosition: G\\n\\n2022-23 team: Pittsburgh Penguins\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 47 GP, 2.90 GAA, .909 SV%, +7.4 GSAA\\n\\nSummary: Jarry is the best option for teams looking for a long-term solution in net. Over the last four years the 28-year-old has produced a .915 save percentage and +40.6 GSAA in a beefy 177-game sample.\\n\\nIn that time, his save percentage has never dropped below .909 in a single season. His playoff numbers aren't impressive, but he's played just eight postseason games. Jarry isn't an elite goaltender, but he's a steady option whoever acquires him can feel good about.\\n\\nUpdate: Jarry re-signs with Penguins on five-year, $26.875 million deal\\n\\n13. Adin Hill\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 27\\n\\nPosition: G\\n\\n2022-23 team: Vegas Golden Knights\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 27 GP, 2.45 GAA, .915 SV%, +8.0 GSAA\\n\\nSummary: Everyone values goaltenders differently, but we're willing to put Hill here on account of his incredible run in these playoffs.\\n\\nIf teams see what he's done for the Golden Knights as indicative of his future potential they should jump all over a 27-year-old who doesn't have enough of a track record to command a massive contract. Some clubs might see his recent run as less relevant to his future prospects and opt to steer clear.\\n\\nUpdate: Hill signed a two-year, $9.8-million contract extension to remain with the Golden Knights.\\n\\n14. Jason Zucker\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 31\\n\\nPosition: LW\\n\\n2022-23 team: Pittsburgh Penguins\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 78 GP, 27 G, 21 A, 48 P, 55.0% CF\\n\\nSummary: No free agent scored more goals in 2022-23 than Zucker, who has now scored at least 20 goals in six of the last nine seasons.\\n\\nAs a 12-year veteran who's still relatively young, Zucker has plenty of experience but should still have some good hockey left in him. The winger is a former King Clancy Memorial Trophy Winner who brings intangibles as well as goal scoring. He'd fit nicely on plenty of second lines around the NHL.\\n\\nUpdate: Zucker signed a one-year, $5.3 million deal with the Coyotes\\n\\n15. Ryan Graves\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 28\\n\\nPosition: LD\\n\\n2022-23 team: New Jersey Devils\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 78 GP, 8 G, 18 A, 26 P, 51.1% CF\\n\\nSummary: Graves is a meat-and-potatoes defenseman, but that's a feature not a bug. Although he isn't much of an offensive creator, he's a 6-foot-5, 220-pounder who ranked 20th in the NHL in shot blocking in 2022-23 despite playing for a team that dominated the possession game.\\n\\nGraves won't turn a franchise around, but he's got size, youth and defensive acumen on his side. He also occasionally shows some surprising offensive flair.\\n\\nRyan Graves brings the puck to the net and beats Stalock's poke to put the Devils up by 2 in the third!#NJDevils pic.twitter.com/652au0GBTt \\u2014 Hockey Daily 365 l NHL Highlights (@HockeyDaily365) April 2, 2023\\n\\nUpdate: Graves signed a six-year, $27 million contract with the Penguins.\\n\\n16. Shayne Gostisbehere\\n\\nShayne Gostisbehere will have plenty of suitors in free agency. (Karl D Deblaker/Getty Images)\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 30\\n\\nPosition: LD\\n\\n2022-23 team(s): Arizona Coyotes/Carolina Hurricanes\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 75 GP, 13 G, 28 A, 41 P, 51.4% CF\\n\\nSummary: It's easy to see the appeal of Gostisbehere as a puck-mover with a history of putting up solid points totals and possession metrics. He's also relatively young for a free agent and just gave the Hurricanes some quality minutes in the playoffs.\\n\\nThat said, there's a reason Carolina was able to rent him for a 2026 third-round pick at the trade deadline and started his even-strength shifts in the offensive zone more than 60% of the time in the postseason. There are real defensive concerns here, and whoever picks up Gostisbehere needs to have a plan for how to deploy him.\\n\\nUpdate: Gostisbehere signed a one-year, $4.125 million deal with the Red Wings\\n\\n17. Scott Mayfield\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 30\\n\\nPosition: RD\\n\\n2022-23 team: New York Islanders\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 6 G, 18 A, 24 P, 48.0% CF\\n\\nSummary: Like Graves, Mayfield is a big, strong, defensive defenseman who's listed at 6-foot-5, 220 pounds. His right shot could make him especially appealing to certain teams.\\n\\nWe have him slightly below Graves because he's a couple of years older and offers a little less offensively, but Mayfield would be the perfect stay-at-home partner to an offensively imaginative defenseman. He logged 21:02 per game with the Islanders last year and started more than 60% of his even-strength shifts in the defensive zone.\\n\\nImagine the polar opposite of Gostisbehere, and that's essentially what Mayfield brings.\\n\\nUpdate: Mayfield signed a seven-year, $24.5 million contract with the Islanders.\\n\\n18. Tomas Tatar\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 32\\n\\nPosition: LW\\n\\n2022-23 team: New Jersey Devils\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 20 G, 28 A, 48 P, 57.3% CF\\n\\nSummary: Tatar is not an exciting name, but he's a possession-metric beast who puts up strong offensive numbers wherever he goes.\\n\\nThe Czech veteran is a middle-six player who can chip in on the power play if needed and provide solid secondary scoring numbers. His range of outcomes is relatively narrow, but anyone looking for a consistent producer is unlikely to be disappointed. The main concerns with Tatar are his age and the fact he doesn't bring any penalty-killing utility.\\n\\n19. John Klingberg\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 31\\n\\nPosition: RD\\n\\n2022-23 team(s): Anaheim Ducks/Minnesota Wild\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 67 GP, 10 G, 23 A, 33 P, 44.2% CF\\n\\nSummary: Klingberg's stock has fallen significantly since he came sixth in Norris Trophy voting twice (2015-16 and 2017-18), but he's still a valuable player. The Swede has skated at least 20 minutes per night in each of his nine NHL seasons, and he's never produced fewer than 32 points.\\n\\nOn the flip side, he doesn't really kill penalties, doesn't provide much of a physical presence and has posted average possession metrics in recent years. He could still run a power play in a pinch, but he's probably more of a fill-in than a top option for that role at this point.\\n\\nEven so, a right-shot defenseman with some offensive ability and a history of carrying heavy workloads should generate some interest.\\n\\nUpdate: Klingberg signed a one-year, $4.15 million deal with the Maple Leafs\\n\\n20. Frederik Andersen\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 33\\n\\nPosition: G\\n\\n2022-23 team: Carolina Hurricanes\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 34 GP, 2.48 GAA, .903 SV%, -0.7 GSAA\\n\\nSummary: Andersen is coming off a strong playoff run (.927 SV%) and during his last full season he posted a .922 save percentage. The Dane's tenure in Toronto ended poorly, but when he's healthy he's been remarkably consistent throughout his career.\\n\\nIt's not advisable for the 33-year-old to make 60-plus starts like he once did, but he's a good candidate to be a 1A goaltender with a competent backup. The only worry here is durability and whether playing behind the Hurricanes' excellent defense has juiced his numbers the last two seasons.\\n\\nUpdate: Andersen signed a two-year, $6.8 million contract to remain with the Hurricanes\\n\\n21. Erik Haula\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 32\\n\\nPosition: C/LW\\n\\n2022-23 team: New Jersey Devils\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 80 GP, 14 G, 27 A, 41 P, 53.9% CF\\n\\nSummary: There's nothing that Haula does extraordinarily well, but he's an extremely versatile forward who's a good fit as a third-line center or middle-six winger. He can kill penalties or jump on the power play if needed and he wins draws at an impressive clip.\\n\\nHaula has plenty of playoff experience and has received plaudits for the veteran leadership he brings. Coming off two straight seasons with more than 40 points, the market for the Finn should be robust.\\n\\nUpdate: Haula signed a three-year, $9.45 million deal to remain with the New Jersey Devils.\\n\\n22. Joonas Korpisalo\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 29\\n\\nPosition: G\\n\\n2022-23 team(s): Columbus Blue Jackets/Los Angeles Kings\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 34 GP, 2.87 GAA, .914 SV%, +11.5 GSAA\\n\\nSummary: Korpisalo is on the right side of 30 and coming off a strong season split between Columbus and Los Angeles. He also has a surprisingly strong playoff resume after leading the Blue Jackets to an upset win over the Maple Leafs in 2019-20 while setting the NHL record for saves in a playoff game (85) the following round against Tampa Bay.\\n\\nViewed through that lens he could be considered a candidate to start for years to come, but for most of his career he's produced like a backup with a career GSAA mark of -41.1. Korpisalo is the type of player who is open to interpretation.\\n\\nIf you think he turned a corner last year, he could have immense value. If you put more weight in his track record, steering clear is the best move.\\n\\nUpdate: Korpisalo signed a five-year, $20 million deal with the Senators.\\n\\n23. Semyon Varlamov\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 35\\n\\nPosition: G\\n\\n2022-23 team: New York Islanders\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 23 GP, 2.70 GAA, .913 SV%, +6.0 GSAA\\n\\nSummary: Varlamov doesn't have the ceiling of Korpisalo as a possible long-term solution, but he's reliable when healthy. The veteran has a .916 save percentage over his last six seasons without falling below .909 once. His GSAA in that time is +52.9, and he led the NHL in the metric as recently as 2020-21.\\n\\nAge and durability are the issues here. His games played have declined each season since 2017-18 and he hasn't topped 40 games in any of the last three seasons. You know what you're going to get from Varlamov when he's on the ice, but it's unclear how available he'll be.\\n\\nUpdate: Varlamov signed a four-year, $11 million contract to remain with the Islanders\\n\\n24. Luke Schenn\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 33\\n\\nPosition: RD\\n\\n2022-23 team(s): Vancouver Canucks/Toronto Maple Leafs\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 70 GP, 4 G, 18 A, 22 P, 45.2% CF\\n\\nSummary: If Schenn plays like he did for the Maple Leafs in the playoffs he'll be a heck of a pickup, but it's tough to count on that going forward. His lack of speed is an issue and there's a reason that he was available for less than $1 million last offseason.\\n\\nHis work in 2022-23 warrants a significant raise, but it's unclear if he can sustain a high level of play over the course of an entire season. As a two-time Stanley Cup winner who is among the NHL's most prolific hitters he will have plenty of fans among GMs, though.\\n\\nUpdate: Schenn signed a three-year, $8.25 million contract with the Predators.\\n\\n25. Alexander Kerfoot\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 29\\n\\nPosition: C/LW\\n\\n2022-23 team: Toronto Maple Leafs\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 10 G, 22 A, 32 P, 52.1% CF\\n\\nSummary: Kerfoot is just one year removed from a 51-point season and he's been a durable middle-six contributor capable of playing multiple roles for the Maple Leafs in recent years.\\n\\nWhile he's increased his value by becoming a skilled penalty killer in recent seasons, he's also been deployed at center less frequently. At this point his best role is probably as a third-line winger, but he's still not 30 and can provide a little offensive punch from that spot.\\n\\nUpdate: Kerfoot signed a two-year, $7 million deal with the Coyotes.\\n\\n26. Antti Raanta\\n\\nAnti Raanta has a career save percentage of .918. (Josh Lavallee/NHLI via Getty Images)\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 34\\n\\nPosition: G\\n\\n2022-23 team: Carolina Hurricanes\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 27 GP, 2.20 GAA, .910 SV%, +3.7 GSAA\\n\\nSummary: Raanta arguably played better than Andersen this season, but he doesn't have the same track record as a starter. The Finn has played more than 33 games just once in his career and Carolina seemed to prefer Andersen when both netminders were healthy.\\n\\nRaanta has strong career numbers, but he seems typecast in the 1B role and it's unlikely he'll get a chance to do more as he approaches his mid-30s. Despite his possible role limitations, the veteran has a solid body of work with a .920 save percentage since 2014-15. In that time he's never posted a GSAA worse than -1.4.\\n\\nUpdate: Raanta re-signed with the Hurricanes on a one-year, $1.5 million contract\\n\\n27. Max Pacioretty\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 34\\n\\nPosition: LW\\n\\n2022-23 team: Carolina Hurricanes\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 5 GP, 3 G, 0 A, 3 P, 65.1% CF\\n\\nSummary: Pacioretty is a total mystery box after playing just 44 games in the last two seasons due to injury issues. To his credit, he has 22 goals in those contests so his goal scoring touch may not have deserted him, but a guy his age coming off an Achilles injury is tough to trust.\\n\\nThe veteran would be a good fit for a contender that wouldn't rely on him to be an offensive force, but would welcome a boost in that area if he's able to provide it. Despite his recent injury troubles, only 10 players have scored more goals than Pacioretty since his first full season in 2011-12.\\n\\nUpdate: Pacioretty signed a one-year, $2 million deal with the Capitals.\\n\\n28. Pierre Engvall\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 27\\n\\nPosition: LW\\n\\n2022-23 team(s): Toronto Maple Leafs/New York Islanders\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 76 GP, 17 G, 13 A, 30 P, 53.6% CF\\n\\nSummary: Engvall's combination of size and speed has never resulted in the kind of production you'd expect, but he remains an intriguing talent. After being traded to the Islanders last season he was given a larger role than he had in Toronto and responded well with nine points in 18 games and strong possession metrics.\\n\\nWhile Engvall frustrated the Maple Leafs at times, it's unusual to find a free agent whose best years are ahead of him and that description could fit the speedy winger.\\n\\nUpdate: Engvall re-signed with the Islanders on a seven-year, $21 million contract.\\n\\n29. Evan Rodrigues\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 30\\n\\nPosition: LW/C\\n\\n2022-23 team: Colorado Avalanche\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 69 GP, 13 G, 26 A, 39 P, 56.4% CF\\n\\nSummary: Rodrigues is an eight-year NHL veteran, but he established a new level of production over the last two with 82 points in 151 games. The 17:51 he skated per night with the Avalanche last season was a career-high by more than two minutes. He took to the larger role with aplomb and meshed well with superstar center Nathan MacKinnon.\\n\\nRodrigues is a similar utility forward to Kerfoot in that he can move around the lineup as needed, but he's a year older and doesn't have much of a penalty-killing track record. He's also a notoriously poor finisher with a career shooting percentage of 7.8%.\\n\\nUpdate: Rodrigues signed a four-year, $12 million deal with the Panthers\\n\\n30. Phil Kessel\\n\\nAge on October 1, 2023: 35\\n\\nPosition: RW\\n\\n2022-23 team: Vegas Golden Knights\\n\\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 14 G, 22 A, 36 P, 56.4% CF\\n\\nSummary: You could make an argument that there are more worthy candidates for the final spot on this list, but it seems right to give Phil the Thrill some credit.\\n\\nKessell is still capable of making secondary offensive contributions, his durability is beyond reproach and he's a locker room sage who's seen and done it all. The winger is just eight points short of 1,000 and should get a chance to purse that milestone with somebody if he wants to keep playing.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Nbcsportsboston.com\", \"author\": \"NBC Sports Boston\", \"title\": \"2023 NHL free agency tracker: Latest rumors, news, contracts from Day 1\", \"description\": \"Keep it right here with our NHL free agency live blog for all the latest rumors, news, contract details and more from Day 1.\", \"url\": \"https://www.nbcsportsboston.com/nhl/boston-bruins/2023-nhl-free-agency-tracker-latest-rumors-news-contracts-from-day-1/540956/?partner=yahoo\", \"text\": \"The most exciting part of the NHL offseason has arrived.\\n\\nFree agency begins Saturday at noon ET, when teams can officially sign players from rival teams to new contracts.\\n\\nSalary cap space is limited for many teams because the cap rose just $1 million to $83.5 million for the 2023-24 season.

Let's skate through five:\\n\\nWinner: Chicago Blackhawks\\n\\nLet's start with the easy one. The Blackhawks phased away from the Patrick Kane era and immediately into the Bedard era.\\n\\nLottery luck was the reason that dream became a reality, and now Bedard is bringing an elite skill set to the table after logging 71 goals and 72 assists in 57 games with the WHL's Regina Pats in 2022-23.\\n\\nBedard, 17, doesn't need acres of space to thrive. His dribbling and puck-striking abilities are simply extraordinary for his age, and his output statistics are mesmerizing from an analytics perspective.\\n\\nThere was no way the Blackhawks could mess up this pick, and they effortlessly exit the draft as clear winners. And that's before they landed Oliver Moore at No. 19, a player who could've cracked the top 10 based on his pure skating prowess.\\n\\nLoser: Anaheim Ducks\\n\\nIt was known for quite some time that Bedard would go to Chicago. That made the Ducks' selection at No. 2 overall the real intrigue. And they provided it.\\n\\nAnaheim currently is in a five-year playoff drought and needs potential stars through the draft to help accelerate its rebuild. The Ducks then drafted center Leo Carlsson, which came across as quite confusing.\\n\\nIt's not on Carlsson, who was generally considered a top-five prospect entering the draft, but rather Anaheim passing on a player like Adam Fantilli, who could've been the top pick himself had it not been for Bedard.\\n\\nCarlsson, best known for his playmaking and creativity, will need to add a legitimate goal-scoring bag down the line to justify the Ducks' decision to grab him this high.\\n\\nWinner: Columbus Blue Jackets\\n\\nColumbus has been around as an NHL franchise for 22 years since its founding in 2001. But it has only made the playoffs six times and currently is in a three-year drought.\\n\\nFor a small-market team, getting high draft picks right is the healthiest way to climb up the standings. Fortunately for Columbus, Anaheim's decision to pass on Fantilli made the Blue Jackets' job much easier.\\n\\nFantilli, boasting a 6-foot-2, 195-pound frame, has immense physical strength that doesn't hinder his speed when skating around the ice. The Michigan product recorded 1.81 points per game as a freshman, the most by a draft-eligible player since Paul Kariya in 1992-93.\\n\\nHis output is already solid for his age, but considering his mechanics and shot angles could benefit from enhancing, Fantilli falling to the No. 3 overall pick was an unbelievably colossal win for the Blue Jackets.\\n\\nLoser: Trades\\n\\nGeneral managers on Wednesday didn't have much to do besides making selections.\\n\\nIn terms of draft-night trades, there were none. All 32 picks passed by and none moved to another team.\\n\\nThe only trade involving the 2023 draft came earlier in the day when the Colorado Avalanche acquired forward Ross Colton from the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for a second-round pick.\\n\\nWinner: Philadelphia Flyers\\n\\nPhiladelphia had quite a special talent fall in its lap. Matvei Michkov was widely seen as a clear-cut top-five pick, with the potential of going at No. 3. However, he dropped to the Flyers at No. 7.\\n\\nThere were a couple of reasons for his slide that involved his availability to play in the NHL since he's currently under contract with KHL's SKA St. Petersburg in Russia through the 2025-26 season.\\n\\nBut the Flyers have a scout based in Russia, Ken Hoodikoff, who has watched prospects there in person, per NBC Sports Philadelphia. So landing a talent like Michkov, even though it's not transparent when and if he'll able to transition to the NHL, at No. 7 has the potential to be a crucial win in the long run.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Yahoo Entertainment\", \"author\": \"Yahoo Sports Canada\", \"title\": \"NHL mock draft: Final predictions for first round\", \"description\": \"Here's how we see the first round of the 2023 NHL Draft shaking out on June 28.\", \"url\": \"https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/2023-nhl-mock-draft-final-predictions-for-all-32-first-round-picks-latest-intel-160145773.html\", \"text\": \"The 2023 NHL Draft in Nashville is rapidly approaching. Anticipation of Connor Bedard\\u2019s draft day will finally come to a close, and fans will learn where the next tier including Adam Fantilli, Leo Carlsson, and the hotly debated Matvei Michkov will land.\\n\\nAs the opening round progresses, teams will begin to reshape their draft boards, taking into consideration the results of interviews at the recent NHL draft combine and positional needs. Things will shuffle around, and there\\u2019s always the inclusion of a few wild cards where a team believes it has seen something in a player that others have not.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s a look at how Round 1 of the 2023 NHL Draft could play out on Wednesday night with the latest intel and trade news.\\n\\nWednesday update\\n\\nThe Fourth Period's Anthony DiMarco says the Flyers have \\\"very high interest\\\" in Ryan Leonard with the seventh overall pick, while TSN's Darren Dreger speculates whether the Flyers may try to upgrade their 22nd overall pick with defenseman Travis Sanheim continuing to draw interest.\\n\\nThe Athletic's Corey Pronman says the Blue Jackets are \\\"head over heels\\\" for Will Smith and believes Columbus would take him over Leo Carlsson.\\n\\nSportsnet's Elliotte Friedman believes it's possible the Ducks \\\"throw a curveball\\\" at No. 2 and that \\\"people believe\\\" they could take Michkov.\\n\\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning traded into the second round, acquiring the 37th pick from Colorado in exchange for forward Ross Colton . Prior to the trade, Tampa only had three picks for 2023 (two sixth-round picks and one seventh).\\n\\nNashville Hockey Now's Michael Gallagher says the Predators, who own the 15th and 24th picks, are trying to move into the top five , but it appears unlikely any of those teams are willing to budge. Gallagher also says the Canadiens are high on Michkov, and that a move into the top-10 is \\\"a bit more doable\\\" for Nashville.\\n\\nTuesday update\\n\\nSenators GM Pierre Dorion said it's \\\"unlikely\\\" his team will acquire a first-round pick in this year's draft. The Senators, who have been listening to offers for star winger Alex DeBrincat , traded their 2023 first-rounder to the Arizona Coyotes in the Jakob Chychrun trade .\\n\\nThe Blue Jackets are expected to draft a \\\"future No. 1 center\\\" with the third pick, according to The Athletic's Aaron Portzline. Centers who could be available in that range include Adam Fantilli, Leo Carlsson and Will Smith.\\n\\nMichkov met with several teams this week in Nashville, according to TSN's Bob McKenzie . The Montreal Canadiens and Philadelphia Flyers are among the teams who reportedly met with the top prospect and his agent before Wednesday's draft.\\n\\nChicago Blackhawks - Connor Bedard, C, Regina (WHL) - He's a generational talent who will make an immediate impact in Chicago. As the organization says goodbye to Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane, Bedard steps in as the new face of the franchise. With brilliant hands and speed, Bedard is the full package.\\n\\nAnaheim Ducks - Adam Fantilli, C, Michigan (NCAA) - With Trevor Zegras and Mason McTavish already down the middle, there\\u2019s no reason to rush Fantilli to the NHL. That said, he could step in and play right now. Big and skilled, Fantilli is a first-overall talent who the Ducks will be lucky enough to win at second.\\n\\nColumbus Blue Jackets - Leo Carlsson, C, Orebro (SHL) - The Blue Jackets are going to have one of the better blue lines in the league moving forward, and they\\u2019ve done some work on the wings, but adding Carlsson up the middle \\u2014 with the flexibility of moving the bullish forward to the wing \\u2014 gives the Blue Jackets versatility up front. Carlsson brings a full tool kit with great hands, good skating, and size to boot at 6-foot-3 and climbing.\\n\\nSan Jose Sharks - Will Smith, C, USNTDP - A record-breaking U-18 World Championship was hard to overlook. Smith sees the ice so well and is an elite level playmaker. San Jose is in the early stages of trying to turn around its roster, and allowing Smith a season (or two) to marinate with Boston College in the NCAA fits its timeline.\\n\\nMontreal Canadiens - Matvei Michkov, F, Sochi (KHL) - Based on talent alone, Michkov is a top-three pick. The fact he can\\u2019t come to North America until the 2026-27 season is a risk factor that deserves consideration. His skill is undeniable, and a team like Montreal that already boasts Juraj Slafkovsky, Cole Caufield, Nick Suzuki and others could be in contention when a then-matured Michkov is ready to emerge. He\\u2019ll be in North America for the draft, and if his interviews go well, he could be off the board sooner. If they go poorly, who knows?\\n\\nArizona Coyotes - Axel Sandin Pellikka, D, Skelleftea AIK (J20 Nationell) - There\\u2019s truly no guarantee David Reinbacher isn\\u2019t the first blueliner chosen, as both he and Sandin Pellikka have been on an upward trajectory all season. After picking forward after forward, the Coyotes need an elite puck-moving blueliner to help their transition and to distribute to those players. Sandin Pellika has those traits.\\n\\nPhiladelphia Flyers - Zach Benson, C, Winnipeg (WHL) - He can shoot the puck, varying his release point with the best in the game. Benson is the type of high-end skilled player teams should be targeting in the first round, as he has the potential to fill the net for the Flyers, who look like they\\u2019re plunging closer to a full rebuild.\\n\\nWashington Capitals - David Reinbacher, D, Kloten (NL) - Washington is getting older, and the Alex Ovechkin era is creeping closer to an end. Securing a blueliner to take over for John Carlson as the team\\u2019s backbone would be a coup at this spot. Reinbacher has that potential, and can step to the AHL next season.\\n\\nDetroit Red Wings - Dalibor Dvorsky, C, AIK (Allsvenskan) - Dvorsky has been a bit up and down, but he\\u2019s a scorer, and if you\\u2019re the Red Wings seeing light at the end of the tunnel, you need to swing for the fences. Dvorsky fits that bill. You can find players to contribute in other ways, but an innate talent for finding the back of the net is not a teachable trait.\\n\\nSt. Louis Blues - Ryan Leonard, LW, USNTDP - If you think back to the Blues\\u2019 Stanley Cup season in 2019, you can almost envision Leonard playing a multi-faceted role. He\\u2019s skilled and can drive play, but he\\u2019s relentless on the puck as well. Leonard elevates the play of those around him, and is the type of player who will thrive in must-win situations.\\n\\nVancouver Canucks - Eduard Sale, RW, Brno (Czechia) - Sale has the potential to become a steal at this position, and that\\u2019s exactly what the Canucks need. They could select a \\u201csafer\\u201d player like Oliver Moore or Matthew Wood, but this is a club in need of a home run. If either Reinbacher or Sandin Pellikka are still on the board, Vancouver has a desperate need for defensive help, which could also cause them to reach for Dmitri Simashev or Mikhail Gulyayev at this point.\\n\\nArizona Coyotes (from Ottawa Senators) - Oliver Moore, C, USNTDP - Similar to the Canucks, it would not be surprising to see the Coyotes grab a blueliner as they\\u2019ve stocked up on forwards the past few drafts. Moore, however, can contribute in multiple ways, particularly as a stellar two-way player. Headed to the University of Minnesota, he has a solid development path secured.\\n\\nPittsburgh Penguins - Matthew Wood, LW, Connecticut, (NCAA) - Imagine if Kyle Dubas\\u2019 first pick with the Penguins is the player in this draft who perhaps most resembles Matthew Knies. Big and powerful with NCAA experience, Wood could be a valuable piece in beginning what will be a very long building process for the Penguins. It would not be a surprise to see Dubas opt for a smaller, skilled player, but Wood has attributes that are hard to pass on.\\n\\nNashville Predators - Mikhail Gulyayev, D, Omskie Yastreby (KHL) - There\\u2019s something that feels very \\u201cNashville\\u201d about Gulyayev. A smooth-skating, puck-moving blueliner coming into an organization that is watching Roman Josi and Tyson Barrie age as their top two offensive rearguards.\\n\\nCalgary Flames - Andrew Cristall, LW, Kelowna (WHL) - At the U-18s, Cristall was\\u2026okay. His vision and playmaking were still evident, but he was unable to dominate opponents like he did this season in the WHL. The blip was likely a blip, but it wouldn\\u2019t be surprising to see him slide into the second half of the opening round.\\n\\nDetroit Red Wings (from New York Islanders via Vancouver Canucks) - Colby Barlow, LW, Owen Sound (OHL) - Detroit must continue to shoot for high-end skill with every pick after building its stable of prospects. Barlow is a top-tier shooter with a wicked release who can pick corners from anywhere. You can\\u2019t teach scoring, and Barlow is at the top of the class.\\n\\nWinnipeg Jets - Nate Danielson, C, Brandon (WHL) - Winnipeg needs to pick a center, with organizational depth there in question as Mark Scheifele ages and Pierre-Luc Dubois looks to leave town. Danielson is so polished he looks like one of the most certain NHLers in the pool. Excellent in all areas of the ice, he is a smooth skater with two-way capabilities.\\n\\nChicago Blackhawks (from Tampa Bay Lightning) - Riley Heidt, C, Prince George (WHL) - With Bedard in the bag, why not take a crack at someone who can add another punch of offense? You can never have too much skill, and Heidt has high-end vision and scoring abilities. If he were shifted to the wing, Heidt is one of the best playmakers out there and could feed Bedard in the future, or run a second line.\\n\\nSeattle Kraken - Dmitri Simashev, D, Lokomotiv Yaroslavl (KHL) - After picking forwards the past two years, a 6-foot-4 defender who is mobile, transitions the puck well, and can punish opposition adds a new dimension to the Kraken.\\n\\nMinnesota Wild - Samuel Honzek, C, Vancouver (WHL) - Big body, big hits, reliable two-way player. There\\u2019s a lot to like in Honzek. He\\u2019s a safe bet, although his NHL ceiling is yet to be determined.\\n\\nPhiladelphia Flyers (from Los Angeles Kings via Columbus Blue Jackets) - Calum Ritchie, C, Oshawa (OHL) - Coming into this season, Ritchie was a projected top 10 pick. He has size and is a consistent producer, but not to the degree many expected this year. Flyers fans will love his combination of size and scoring.\\n\\nNew York Rangers - Brayden Yager, C, Moose Jaw (WHL) - In all the glitz and glamor that is New York, Yager has a shot that can light the lamp and excite a fan base. He could easily be off the board by this point in the draft, but if he\\u2019s not, it will be hard for any team to pass on his skill set.\\n\\nNashville Predators (from Edmonton Oilers) - Otto Stenberg, C, Frolunda (J20 Sweden) - After an up-and-down campaign, Stenberg was brilliant at the U-18s, leaving a spectacular final impression in the minds of scouts. Nashville has a penchant for taking European players high, and Stenberg has upside worth swinging for as a second pick in the opening round.\\n\\nSt. Louis Blues (from Toronto Maple Leafs) - Tom Willander, D, Rogle (J20 Sweden) - After selecting a forward earlier in the draft, the Blues can diversify their selections with a player like Willander, who thrives by utilizing his skating to evade checkers and turn pucks up ice. He\\u2019ll play at Boston University next year, opening the door for an ascension to the AHL the year after.\\n\\nSan Jose Sharks (from New Jersey Devils) - Quentin Musty, LW, Sudbury (OHL) - He has good size and chooses his spots wisely. Opting almost equally to shoot and distribute, Musty exploded this year on a bad team.\\n\\nColorado Avalanche - Bradley Nadeau, C, Penticton (BCHL) - The team that stole Cale Makar out of the Canadian Junior A level might find another Junior A superstar. The upside in Nadeau is immense when you watch his hands and see how he reads the ice. Nadeau is headed to Maine, and could eventually turn into one of the steals of this draft.\\n\\nToronto Maple Leafs (from Boston Bruins via Washington Capitals) - Oliver Bonk, D, London (OHL) - The Leafs have tried to fix their problems externally for too long. As a minute-muncher who can contain attackers in the D-zone and quickly transition pucks up ice, Bonk is the type of blueliner the organization has looked for. There\\u2019s offensive upside in Bonk, but not at the expense of defending.\\n\\nSt. Louis Blues (from Dallas Stars via New York Rangers) - Daniil But, LW, Loko Yaroslavl (MHL) - With their third pick of the opening round, the Blues should continue to choose players with more upside. But combines a 6-foot-5 frame with soft hands and strong skating. If he begins using his frame more impactfully in terms of winning puck battles and if he can add even a modicum of physicality, the last portions of his potential will begin to flourish. He's worth the risk at this point.\\n\\nCarolina Hurricanes - Lukas Dragicevic, D, Tri-City (WHL) - Dragicevic doesn\\u2019t necessarily fit the mold of blueliners who have found success in Carolina in recent years, as he\\u2019s all offense with defensive deficiencies. But it\\u2019s a strong organization for him to learn the other aspects. He\\u2019s the type of defenseman who can run a power play.\\n\\nColorado Avalanche (From Florida via Montreal) - Jayden Perron, C, Chicago (USHL) - Why swing for the fences once, when you can do it twice? Perron is a smaller forward with plenty of creativity, primarily as a playmaker, but also as a scorer. Headed to North Dakota in the NCAA next year, he\\u2019s another skilled forward with a strong development path ahead.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Inside the Magic\", \"author\": \"Laura Hermoza\", \"title\": \"Universal Studios vs. Disney World: Which One is Better?\", \"description\": \"The Universal Studios vs. Disney World debate is forever ongoing.

Even nearby Tampa has contending Busch Gardens to boast about. But it\\u2019s the consistently steady competition between Walt Disney World Resort and Universal Orlando Resort that continues to reign supreme.\\n\\nSome folks are diehard Disney fans, while others are unanimously loyal to Universal. Then there are others\\u2014mainly first-timers\\u2014who haven\\u2019t yet made up their minds on which is the better pursuit. If the last scenario describes you, then you\\u2019re in luck because we at Inside the Magic have compiled this ultimate comparison guide.\\n\\nAn Overview\\n\\nWalt Disney World Resort and Universal Orlando Resort (sometimes referred to as \\u201cUniversal Studios Orlando\\u201d) are easily the most renowned theme park destinations in Central Florida. Both comprise onsite hotels, sport some of the most innovative and impressive attractions in the world, operate multiple parks, and draw in millions of visitors annually. Disney World was first on the scene, opening in October 1971. Universal came about nearly two decades later, in June 1990.\\n\\nSize Comparisons\\n\\nDoes bigger always mean better? That all depends on whether you perceive an enormous Resort destination as having more profuse offerings or just being more burdensome to navigate.\\n\\nDisney World spans over 40 square miles in contrast to Universal Orlando Resort, which roughly covers two square miles. Although, let it be known that the latter is in the process of expanding, which will nearly double its current size specs. That\\u2019s still significantly smaller than Walt Disney World Resort in its entirety.\\n\\nRelated: Just How Big IS Walt Disney World?\\n\\nHow Many Different Parks?\\n\\nWalt Disney World Resort features four main theme parks. They are Magic Kingdom Park, EPCOT, Hollywood Studios, and Animal Kingdom Park. There are also two resident water parks onsite\\u2014Disney\\u2019s Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach.\\n\\nUniversal Orlando Resort has two distinct theme parks, which are Universal Studios Florida and Universal Islands of Adventure. The Resort also boasts an impressive water park\\u2014Universal\\u2019s Volcano Bay. Also, as previously mentioned, Universal is in the process of expanding with the establishment of a new theme park\\u2014Universal Epic Universe, which is slated to open by 2025.\\n\\nConsiderations for the duration of your vacation and how much you can reasonably accomplish during your time in Orlando may impact your decision on whether you initially decide to do Disney or Universal. Of course, there is no requirement for having to do all the aforementioned Parks at either Resort.\\n\\nRelated: How Does Each Disney Park Rank Against One Another?\\n\\nOnsite Accommodations\\n\\nDisney and Universal each have their very own onsite accommodations, all of which range in designations to suit various budgets. Disney World offers over 25 onsite accommodations and several honorary Good Neighbor Resorts. The current onsite offerings for Universal Orlando hotels stand at eight, with various other hotels near Universal Orlando additionally.\\n\\nGuests at Disney and Universal accommodations experience a wide range of exclusive perks and amenities, including complimentary transportation to each one\\u2019s theme parks, water parks, and Resort Entertainment hubs (Disney Springs and Universal CityWalk). Disney and Universal Resorts all excel in outdoing the area competition by leaps and bounds.\\n\\nRelated: Is It Better to Stay at a Disney Value Resort?\\n\\nWhich Attractions Are Where?\\n\\nIt can be confusing for inexperienced first-time vacationers to the Orlando Resort Area to keep straight about which attractions and experiences are exclusive to Disney World and which are the products of Universal. This is especially true about those gray area matters, like how Marvel is now associated with the Walt Disney Company, yet Universal Islands of Adventure features Marvel Super Hero Island. Universal also has a few Simpsons-related attractions despite Disney\\u2019s having bought Fox. Other areas of confusion emerge regarding the fact that Hollywood Studios in Disney World sounds far more like a place in Universal, and the Jurassic Park attractions in Universal seem far more suited to DinoLand U.S.A. at Disney\\u2019s Animal Kingdom Park.\\n\\nSo, our best advice for prospective vacationers is to thoroughly research beforehand which experiences to pursue and to learn which ones are where before ever purchasing any Disney or Universal tickets.\\n\\nTyke Likes and Family Thrills\\n\\nYour decision may also essentially come down to the types of rides and attractions you\\u2019re seeking. For instance, Disney World tends to focus more on family-friendly attractions that can be enjoyed by variously aged members of any traveling party. By contrast, Universal boasts many more high-octane thrill rides that may not necessarily suit smaller Guests or those looking for calmer experiences. In fact, more rides at Universal have height restrictions than those at Disney World.\\n\\nRelated: Which One\\u2019s Better? Disney\\u2019s TRON or Universal\\u2019s Hagrid?\\n\\nIn-Park Entertainment\\n\\nBoth Resorts present nighttime spectaculars, although Disney provides much more variation within its various Parks. Not to be outdone, Universal boasts some pretty top-rated sights, too, like Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle, for instance.\\n\\nThere are also multiple stage shows happening on the scene at each location, along with various parades and other fun. As a beloved and timeless tradition, Disney always has a daytime parade offering, while Universal doesn\\u2019t adhere to such a constant ritual. When there is a Universal parade, though, it comes as a more casual affair\\u2014far less congested than the crammed-in Disney scenes.\\n\\nCharacters\\n\\nCharacter offerings at each location also differ. Disney has trademark-licensed Disney and Pixar Pals on the scene, while Universal has varying other entertaining personas from film and otherwise. Disney Character Meet and Greets can sometimes be lengthy with extensive lines, while Universal\\u2019s approach is more of a low-key mingling on-the-street affair. Disney also provides many more Character Meal engagements throughout Parks and even at some onsite Resorts.\\n\\nSeasonal Events\\n\\nYou can enjoy seasonal happenings at both locations at various times during the year. Holiday happenings, particularly around Halloween and Christmas, garner varying special celebrations. For the former, Disney is renowned for Mickey\\u2019s Not-So-Scary Halloween Parties, while Universal offers Halloween Horror Nights. Both are after-hours ticketed extras. Universal\\u2019s pricing is admittedly cheaper, but Disney\\u2019s offering is far more family-friendly.\\n\\nMickey\\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party reigns on the Disney scene, along with special ongoing holiday happenings throughout EPCOT. Universal focuses on various Grinch-related happenings, including a special nighttime parade and Breakfast Meet and Greet. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter also gets in on the seasonal celebrations. Additionally, there\\u2019s a wonderful wintertime food festival to take note of at Universal.\\n\\nEPCOT\\u2019s acclaimed festivals at Disney World are internationally renowned. Furthermore, there are now many seasonal happenings throughout the year, more times than not. The EPCOT International Food & Wine Festival is still the one that gets the highest recognition, though. But let it be known that Universal has a pretty hopping Mardi Gras food festival celebration onsite too, which occurs between February and mid-April.\\n\\nRelated: Disney Halloween Party Price Nearly Triples in Less Than a Decade\\n\\nFood for Thought\\n\\nFood festivals aside, let\\u2019s discuss the dining options at both locations. Its grander size gives Disney an advantage in providing more options. That also means there\\u2019s more versatility regarding specific cuisine features. We also previously mentioned that Disney has more Character Dining options.\\n\\nWhile Universal Resort can\\u2019t compete with the versatile dining at Disney, it does succeed in offering better pricing for what you do get. This is especially impactful for those who generally stick to quick-service dining. Because neither Resort is offering dining plans presently, you\\u2019ll be paying full price at both locations.\\n\\nDisney may be better for those seeking versatility in cuisine and experience, but Universal is more all-around convenient in pricing and the ease at which you can dine at a given venue. While you\\u2019d do well to make advance dining reservations for places you\\u2019re hoping to score a spot at, it\\u2019s much more necessary to do so at Disney than it is at Universal.\\n\\nExpress Passes\\n\\nDisney and Universal each offer express pass options for enjoying select attractions with little or no wait time. Disney presents an extra paid-for Genie+ service. Additionally, Guests may purchase individual Lightning Lanes for some attractions that aren\\u2019t included in the aforementioned Genie+ service. Universal features the Universal Express System but does an about-face move regarding the pricing for this paid extra, as it is shockingly higher than what Disney presents. Universal Express starts at $90 a person but increases on peak days to as much as $380! Current Genie+/Lightning Lane costs are nowhere near those prices. Let it be known, however, that Universal Express doesn\\u2019t require prearranging arrival times. With Disney, you have to make requested purchases as far in advance as possible (depending on if you are a Resort Guest or staying off-property). This may mean waking up early the day of, on your vacation, no less!\\n\\nTickets\\n\\nYou may purchase single-day tickets to Universal or Disney World or upgrade to one of several multi-day combos at either location. While all prices are subject to change, current single-day (adult) pricing for all four Disney Parks is as follows: $154 for Magic Kingdom Park, $139 for EPCOT, $149 for Hollywood Studios, and $134 for Animal Kingdom Park. Single-day ticket prices for Universal Studios Florida and Universal Islands of Adventure are both currently priced at $109 for adults and $104 for kids. That said, Universal Orlando tickets are generally cheaper than those at Disney Parks.\\n\\nAdd-ons that allow visiting more than one Park a day can be applied to both Disney and Universal tickets alike. At Disney World, this popular option is known as the Park Hopper pass, and it works by letting Guests visit as many of Disney\\u2019s four theme Parks in a single day as they want. Regular base tickets limit you to just one Park a day. Do note that Park Hopping only applies to Disney theme Parks. For those wishing to add water parks to the Park Hopping experience, there\\u2019s an additional Park Hopper Plus option.\\n\\nUniversal allows you to choose from two single-day multi-park ticket upgrades. One is the rightly named 2-Park-1-Day ticket, which covers both Universal Studios Florida and Universal Islands of Adventure, and the other is a 3-Park option that also includes Volcano Bay.\\n\\nAs a common trend, Disney\\u2019s current ticket and Park Hopping system is a bit more stressful and complicated, at least for the present time. That\\u2019s because Guests are still required to make advance Park Reservations in addition to purchasing Park tickets. This infringes on the freedom of former Park Hopping as, for the present time, anyone with Park Hopper cannot \\u201chop\\u201d a second Park until after 2 p.m. Universal doesn\\u2019t require any Advance Park Reservations, which earns it higher marks in Guest satisfaction in that regard.\\n\\nAnnual Passes\\n\\nBoth Resorts offer varying Annual Passes based on price, preference, and other included perks. Disney World currently has only one option for out-of-state visitors, though\\u2014the Disney Incredi-Pass, which goes for $1,399. Other Annual Passes from Disney include Disney Sorcerer ($969) for Vacation Club Members or Florida State Residents, Disney Pirate Pass ($749), and Disney Pixie Dust ($399).\\n\\nWith some overlapping exceptions, Universal Passes tend to be cheaper, with its most expensive Premier Pass going for $904.99. Other Universal Passes include the Preferred Pass ($629.99), Power Pass ($474.99), and Seasonal Pass ($424.99).\\n\\nClosing Thoughts\\n\\nWalt Disney World may offer many more pursuits across the board, but those extras generally result in elevated expenses that may be its undoing. Universal Orlando Resort tends to be more low-key and doesn\\u2019t pack the same stressful need for preplanning. But again, it\\u2019s that balance of iconic experiences and the cost for said experiences that each prospective Guest must personally consider before making any final decisions. Your perfect choice isn\\u2019t necessarily ideal for someone else.\\n\\nDo you think Disney World or Universal Orlando is better?

The quintessential dual threat, he started three games at Notre Dame last season but missed 10 games with a shoulder injury.

A 6-foot-5 Pahokee native who began his career at Michigan, Milton won Tennessee\\u2019s starting job upon his arrival in 2021, but sustained an ankle injury in Game Two, paving the way for Hooker\\u2019s emergence.\\n\\n\\u201cI was hurt, I couldn\\u2019t go back in the game no more, so Hendon did his job,\\u201d Milton said. \\u201cHe went in there, he executed and he kept the offense rolling. What can I say if the coaches chose to (stick with him)? I mean, he did his job.\\u201d\\n\\nIn lieu of the portal, Milton persisted. Now, Heupel has the rare luxury of replacing a third-round NFL draftee with a player well-versed in his breakneck offensive system.\\n\\n\\u201cI truly respect Joe Milton so much for the fact that he had every opportunity to leave, every reason to leave, people talking bad about him and obviously he loses the (starting) job \\u2014 all those different things,\\u201d said Vols senior tight end Jacob Warren, who joined Heupel and Milton at SEC media days on Thursday.\\n\\n\\u201cBut just the fact that he did stick through it and he learned a lot and he grew a lot through the last two years, definitely has my respect.\\u201d\\n\\nBarring another injury, Milton\\u2019s first start against an SEC foe will come in his home state, Sept. 16 against the Gators at The Swamp. In his most recent Florida appearance, he torched Clemson for 251 passing yards and three touchdown (completing 19 of 28 passes) with no picks in a 31-14 Orange Bowl triumph in January.\\n\\nHe had reassumed the starting role when Hooker tore his ACL in the fourth quarter of an astonishing 63-38 loss at South Carolina in mid-November.

Create explosive plays. Win the rushing battle. Play complementary football with offense, defense and special teams working together to win a game.\\n\\nOne issue: Napier isn\\u2019t any other football coach. He\\u2019s the coach of the Gators, where fans don\\u2019t just want to win. They want to win by lighting up the scoreboard, as Florida did with Steve Spurrier and Danny Wuerffel, Urban Meyer and Tim Tebow.\\n\\n\\u201cI love those days,\\u201d Napier said during the recent SEC spring meetings. \\u201cGive me a Wuerffel, five receivers that run 4.4 (seconds in the 40-yard dash), and let\\u2019s go play.\\u201d\\n\\nAlas, barring a remarkable, immediate transformation by Graham Mertz or Jack Miller III, Napier does not have a Wuerffel on his roster. And his receiving corps looks pedestrian by SEC standards.\\n\\nNapier\\u2019s first season doesn\\u2019t inspire much confidence that he\\u2019ll lead an offensive renaissance in Gainesville. UF had a top-five pick (Anthony Richardson) at quarterback and scored only 29.5 points per game \\u2014 the second-worst figure in Napier\\u2019s eight seasons as a head coach or offensive coordinator.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s fair to wonder whether Billy Ball is compatible with the fanbase\\u2019s expectations. Napier thinks it is, once the talent level, schemes and organizational structure click.\\n\\n\\u201cIf we do those things \\u2026 if we evaluate well, we recruit well, we get good quarterback play, we get extremely fast and explosive skill players and we\\u2019re winning the turnover battle and we\\u2019re winning the explosive battle \\u2014 the points will add up, right?\\u201d Napier said.\\n\\nThey did at Napier\\u2019s last stop. His 2019 Ragin\\u2019 Cajuns ranked in the top 10 nationally in scoring (37.9 points per game), total offense (494.1 yards per game), yards per play (7.01) and plays from scrimmage that covered at least 10 yards (18.1 per game). Louisiana\\u2019s statistics regressed slightly the next year, but he still fielded a top-30 scoring offense (33.6 points per game).\\n\\nNapier didn\\u2019t have a stable of Jacquez Greens and Reidel Anthonys on that roster, either. He did, however, have great running backs. His 2019 backfield had three players who have spent time in the NFL: Elijah Mitchell was the 49ers\\u2019 leading rusher in 2021, Raymond Calais was a Bucs\\u2019 seventh-round pick in 2020, and Trey Ragas has been with the Rams and Raiders. Together, they fueled the nation\\u2019s No. 6 rushing attack; Mitchell and Ragas led a top-25 run game the next year, too.\\n\\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\\u2019s college football teams every day.

Explore all your options\\n\\nNapier appears to be building the Gators similarly. Florida\\u2019s offensive strengths last year were a solid offensive line and a pair of talented running backs, Montrell Johnson and Trevor Etienne. That fits one of Napier\\u2019s stated offensive goals, winning the ground game.\\n\\nWill that be enough to win over Florida supporters?\\n\\nThe question is relevant because of the unique nature of this fan base. Jim McElwain won the SEC East in each of his first two seasons but was chewed up in Year 3 partially because of fans\\u2019 frustrations with his ugly offenses. His successor, Dan Mullen, knew from his time as UF\\u2019s offensive coordinator that victories weren\\u2019t always enough. During his first spring as head coach, he reminisced about how fans reacted if the team hadn\\u2019t scored four touchdowns by halftime.\\n\\n\\u201cThere were people telling me I was No. 1,\\u201d Mullen said. \\u201cDifferent fingers.\\u201d\\n\\nThose fingers waved goodbye to him in 2021 because his entertaining offenses couldn\\u2019t overshadow a historically bad defense and subpar recruiting.\\n\\nThe last point is key. Though Napier developed overlooked prospects into Sun Belt standouts at Louisiana \\u2014 lightly recruited quarterback Levi Lewis threw a school-record 74 passing touchdowns under Napier \\u2014 he\\u2019ll need more than three-star recruits to put up 40 points per game or win titles in the SEC. He is starting to win the recruiting battles necessary to make that happen.\\n\\nThe Gators\\u2019 2023 class featured three blue-chip receivers, including speedsters Aidan Mizell and Andy Jean. Florida has non-binding oral commitments from five-star quarterback DJ Lagway, one of the nation\\u2019s top tight ends (Amir Jackson) and a pair of four-star receivers (IMG Academy\\u2019s Jerrae Hawkins and Carrollwood Day\\u2019s Izaiah Williams).\\n\\nNapier\\u2019s rushing history suggests his Gators will probably never be as wide open as Spurrier\\u2019s Fun \\u2018n\\u2019 Gun. But he has shown that Billy Ball can pile on points in a differently entertaining fashion.

I don\\u2019t feel strongly about that prediction or many others, but I\\u2019ll explain my reasoning.\\n\\nSMU, Texas San Antonio and Tulane are the jumbled but clear top tier. I put them in that order. SMU\\u2019s top-15 transfer class and a potential second-year boost from coach Rhett Lashlee made them my preseason championship pick ahead of the Roadrunners (who have high-end talent but are jumping from Conference USA) and Tulane (which I think will regress slightly after losing star running back Tyjae Spears).\\n\\nMemphis\\u2019 stability at head coach and in the conference made the Tigers fourth, just ahead of new member Florida Atlantic and East Carolina (which loses all-time leading passer Holton Ahler).\\n\\nRice, surprisingly, ended up 10th on my ballot. I generally downgraded the newcomers because of concerns about depth as they move up, but I gave the Owls the benefit of the doubt thanks largely to former five-star quarterback JT Daniels.\\n\\nUSF landed in the bottom tier with Tulsa, Alabama Birmingham and Charlotte. All four teams have new coaches and are coming off seasons that ranged from mediocre to awful. I slotted the Bulls ahead of Charlotte (a bad team in a lesser conference last year) and the Blazers (I\\u2019m skeptical about the short-term and long-term prospects under former Bucs quarterback Trent Dilfer).\\n\\nI do, however, think USF will be better this year, even if I don\\u2019t view the Bulls as a bowl team. It\\u2019s hard to envision the defense being worse or the team starting slower; some progress is inevitable. It\\u2019s also reasonable to expect the injury luck to improve, too. Those factors alone should lead to better performances despite my questions about the talent level for Golesh\\u2019s first year.\\n\\nThe Bulls get a break by not having to face SMU or Tulane in conference play, but the non-conference schedule features a national title contender (Alabama), a Conference USA frontrunner (Western Kentucky) and a trip to a UConn program that finally looks competent again. That means we should judge this season on baby steps and incremental growth, even if the win-loss record doesn\\u2019t make a major leap forward.\\n\\nOur AAC predicted order of finish\\n\\n1.

Perhaps the the advertising money and engagement that election year political speech brings are too tempting to pass up. Or maybe they\\u2019re just really committed to free expression.\\n\\n\\n\\nBelow I\\u2019ve laid out how five of the most influential social media platforms are walking the tightrope right now between providing a platform for free speech and allowing people to spread lies and conspiracy theories outright.\\n\\nWhat is Twitter\\u2019s political misinformation policy?\\n\\nTwitter\\u2019s policies regarding speech have changed drastically over the last few years. Before the October 2022 ascension of Elon Musk to CEO, Twitter was fairly locked down when it came to mis/disinformation. It banned political ads altogether in 2019. Policies against spreading lies about Covid and vaccines lead to the suspension of over 11,000 accounts during the early part of the pandemic. Controversial accounts like those of Kanye West and Donald Trump were banned even though they had millions of followers. Significantly, the service prevented the spread of links to a New York Post story about Hunter Biden\\u2019s laptop during the final weeks of the 2020 election, a move many considered a step too far.\\n\\nEverything is different now. Among the first things Elon Musk did upon taking control of Twitter was announce a policy of \\u201cGeneral Amnesty\\u201d for suspended users, overturning bans on thousands of accounts that promoted vaccine denial, general hate speech, bullying, and just about everything else. Twitter has partially reversed its 2019 ban on political advertising this year too, deciding to allow \\u201ccause-based\\u201d ads in the U.S. Musk does draw the line somewhere, though: Trump and Kanye may be free to tweet, but Alex Jones\\u2019s Twitter account remains suspended.\\n\\nHow does YouTube deal with political speech?\\n\\nAnyone who has watched YouTube already knows the company has no problem accepting ads from politicians. But until recently, it prohibited content that called elections into question. In June, YouTube reversed its election integrity policy that pledged to prohibit \\u201cfalse claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in certain past elections to determine heads of government. Or, content that claims that the certified results of those elections were false.\\u201d\\n\\nYouTube\\u2019s new policy acknowledges that removing this content curbed \\u201csome misinformation\\u201d but that it had \\u201cthe unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm.\\u201d Going forward, YouTube says it will \\u201cstop removing content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in the 2020 and other past U.S. Presidential elections.\\u201d Yay.\\n\\nHow does TikTok censor political views?\\n\\nTikTok is a frequent flashpoint for controversy, with concerns over the network\\u2019s connection to China going so far as to trigger Congressional hearings. Whether Americans\\u2019 data is safe from China is an open question, but TikTok has fairly strict policies regarding mis/disinformation. The company\\u2019s \\u201cintegrity and authenticity policy\\u201d prohibits \\u201cinaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent. Significant harm includes physical, psychological, or societal harm, and property damage.\\u201d\\n\\nTo combat misinformation and disinformation of all kinds, TikTok says it employs a small army of fact-checkers from around the world; if they confirm content to be false, TikTok \\u201cmay remove the video from our platform or make the video ineligible for recommendation into For You feeds.\\u201d TikTok does not allow \\u201cpaid political promotion, political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others)\\u201d either.\\n\\nWhat is Facebook\\u2019s policy on political ads and misinformation?\\n\\nSpeaking of political promotion, Meta\\u2019s Facebook, the world\\u2019s largest social media platform, is all over the place on the issue. After being identified as a primary source of foreign-funded disinformation in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Facebook threw up its hands and said \\u201cenough\\u201d after the polls closed in 2020. In an effort to combat \\u201cforeign interference, misinformation and voter suppression,\\u201d the company stopped accepting all political ads, an easy decision to announce after a presidential election. They have since instituted what looks like a \\u201cmiddle ground\\u201d policy around major U.S. elections: During the 2022 midterms, Facebook instituted a restriction period for \\u201cads about social issues, elections or politics in the U.S.\\u201d between Nov. 1\\u2014Nov. 8, 2022 (election day). Whether the policy will stay in place for the 2024 elections remains to be seen.\\n\\nHow does Reddit moderate misleading political speech?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s difficult to imagine what Reddit would look like if all of the misinformation it houses were removed. Reddit has no top-down comprehensive moderation policy concerning misinformation, and that\\u2019s by design. Instead, individual users invent their own moderation policies for subreddits, with whatever rules they like. If a subreddit passes some unspoken line of egregiousness, actual Reddit employees step in and \\u201cquarantine\\u201d the offensive message board, i.e. remove it from search results. It could also be banned, but this is usually caused by violating anti-harassment policy as opposed to an anti lie-about-literally-anything policy.\\n\\nFor example, Reddit banned r/nonewnormal, a vaccination and Covid conspiracy subreddit in 2021, but not for lying or worsening an international pandemic. Instead, r/NoNewNormal was axed for \\u201cbrigading\\u201d other subreddits. Reddit\\u2019s recent moves toward controlling how its unpaid moderators do their non-jobs may suggest a more heavy-handed, \\u201cwe need advertising\\u201d approach is forthcoming at the site.\\n\\nReddit does allow political ads, but promises it \\u201cforbids deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising, even among politicians. It also requires political ad buyers to \\u201cleave comments \\u2018on\\u2019 for (at least) the first 24 hours of any given campaign.\\u201d\\n\\n\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Engadget\", \"author\": \"Mariella Moon\", \"title\": \"Appeals court pauses order that restricts Biden officials from contacting social networks\", \"description\": \"Biden administration officials can freely communicate with social media companies \\u2014 for now.

The lawsuit, the Washington Post reports, is based on emails between the administration and social networks, wherein the former questioned the companies' handling of posts on their websites containing conservative claims on the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential elections, as well as anti-vaccine sentiments.\\n\\nDoughty, a Trump-appointed judge, said the plaintiffs \\\"produced evidence of a massive effort\\\" by the defendants \\\"to suppress speech based on its content.\\\" He also wrote in his decision that if the allegations are true, \\\"the present case arguably involves the most massive attack against free speech in United States history.\\\" His order prohibits federal agencies that include the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security from asking online platforms to take down content with \\\"protected free speech.\\\" They could still, however, communicate with those entities for issues related to criminal activity, national security and election interference by foreign players.\\n\\nConservatives have long believed that mainstream social media platforms are biased against right-wing ideologies. That had led to the launch of social networks associated with conservatives, such as Parler and Donald Trump's Truth Social. The state attorneys argued that federal officials crossed the line by threatening to take antitrust actions against social networks and to limit their Section 230 protections, which allow internet companies to moderate content on their platforms as they see fit. It's worth noting that former President Trump previously signed an executive order that sought to limit federal protections offered by Section 230 after Twitter fact-checked a false tweet he posted.\\n\\nThe Justice Department appealed Doughty's order the day after it was issued, arguing that it was too broad and could limit the government's ability to warn people about false information in times of emergency. Apparently, the administration has already felt its effects after its scheduled meeting with Meta to discuss strategies on how to counter foreign disinformation campaigns was cancelled. This stay will allow federal agencies to continue working with online platforms until the court can look further into the complaint. The appeals court has ordered for the case's oral arguments to be expedited so a final decision could be reached in the near future.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"BBC News\", \"author\": \"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews\", \"title\": \"Jared Kushner testifies in probe of Trump and the 6 Jan riots - reports\", \"description\": \"Donald Trump's son-in-law sat before a federal grand jury last month, US media report\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-66202405\", \"text\": \"Mr Trump has repeatedly claimed - with no evidence - that the 2020 election was rigged against him.

It\\u2019s when we had our first date last year, in a Spanish restaurant in New York\\u2019s Washington Heights. We\\u2019d been chatting online, assessing each other and asking questions. When we met, I knew immediately that he was different. It was love at first sight. He\\u2019s a wonderful guy, sincere and attentive. It\\u2019s miraculous in some ways: Christopher is Chilean and only intended to come as a tourist, then we met and decided we have something special. We got married exactly a year to the day after we met.\\n\\nOur wedding at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau in City Hall, which is near the other New York courthouses, was supposed to be small and secretive, but it turned out to be more of a public event.\\n\\nI\\u2019d known that Donald Trump\\u2019s arraignment was coming because of the media hype, but I didn\\u2019t really pay attention to it. We had no idea it was on the same day until an hour before our wedding. On our way to the ceremony, we bumped into someone we knew. He hugged me and said, \\u201cHow strange that you\\u2019re getting married on the same day that Trump is getting arraigned.\\u201d In shock, I said: \\u201cWhat?\\u201d\\n\\nIt was hard to process. I was getting wedding jitters, too. We began walking to the bureau and the crowds started building \\u2013 it was right next to where Trump was to go to court. I thought, \\u201cOh, God, we\\u2019ve got to get to the church on time.\\u201d When we got within three blocks, it was impassable. We couldn\\u2019t get through the crowds because people were dancing with signs and playing Kool & the Gang\\u2019s Celebration. It was really quite a scene, although I was disturbed by the number of Trump supporters there, saying he had already won the 2024 election and things like that. I am sensitive, so there was sadness as those words registered with me.\\n\\nAs we were about to go in to get married, Trump\\u2019s motorcade arrived\\n\\nIt was supposed to be a three\\u2011block walk, but ended up taking eight blocks because we had to detour around the barriers and the police. We were suited, had a bouquet of flowers and were running through the crowd, trying to get to the courthouse on time while constantly being congratulated and getting a lot of attention.\\n\\nI fed off the crowd\\u2019s energy. As we were passing through, I saw a sign that read \\u201cNo one is above the law\\u201d. It made me think about how, because of same-sex marriage laws passed by the state in 2011, and then legalised across the country in 2015, Christopher and I were able to get married. We have laws to abide by, to honour and respect, but the court next door would soon hold a man who seems to have abused the law and manipulated it constantly.\\n\\nWe were getting married at 2pm and as we were about to go in, Trump\\u2019s motorcade arrived. Before that it had felt like a celebratory street festival \\u2013 despite the angry Trump supporters \\u2013 but when he stepped out of the vehicle, the energy moved up a level; the crowds threw their arms in the air and yelled things like, \\u201cThere is the big lie!\\u201d\\n\\nI remember seeing the scaffolding on the courthouse; to me it represented the idea of being caged, in prison. But next to that, in the marriage bureau, there was joy, matrimony and union. By the time we left, he had left.\\n\\nWe did get to the wedding on time, despite the crowds, and couldn\\u2019t hear the craziness outside. Christopher and I were there together holding hands, I was looking into his eyes, my hands shaking, and I thought, \\u201cThis is what I want. This is the steadiness I\\u2019m looking for, and this is love.\\u201d\\n\\nInside, there were about 15 other couples waiting in line. We all smiled at each other \\u2013 it was like we were all saying, \\u201cThis is the day we\\u2019re getting married?\\u201d It was unreal.\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A data expert who worked on the 2020 election was also reportedly scheduled to appear before a grand jury.\\n\\nHouse speaker Kevin McCarthy has denied he privately promised Trump that he would get legislation passed that would erase Trump\\u2019s two impeachments. According to a Politico report, in return for delaying an endorsement for Trump\\u2019s 2024 president election, McCarthy pledged that he would get the House to vote to expunge both impeachments against the former president. The outlet said McCarthy had promised to do so before Congress leaves for an August recess.\\n\\nThe Democratic-led Senate judiciary committee voted to advance a supreme court ethics reform bill that would tighten financial disclosures and bolster recusal requirements for justices. The vote was along party lines, with Republicans adamantly opposed. The panel vote came after months of scrutiny on the court over ethical controversies supreme court justices have been involved in.\\n\\nConservative non-profit groups steered by the rightwing legal activist, Leonard Leo, reportedly orchestrated a $1.8m public relations campaign to defend and celebrate supreme court justice, Clarence Thomas, after he faced renewed scrutiny over his past misconduct claims.\\n\\nDemocratic presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr defended himself against accusations of racism and antisemitism at a hearing on alleged \\u201cweaponization\\u201d of the federal government.

A report seen by the Guardian said Kennedy has a long history of racism, antisemitism and xenophobia.\\n\\nUpdated at 16.02 EDT\\n\\n5d ago 15.53 EDT Florida Governor Ron DeSantis backed Senator Tommy Tuberville\\u2019s months-long blockade on military nominations over the Pentagon\\u2019s abortion policy, saying that the policy would \\u201cgo out the window\\u201d if he became president. Asked by radio host Hugh Hewitt if he thinks Tuberville should release his hold, DeSantis replied: \\u201cNo I don\\u2019t.\\u201d He added: The military\\u2019s policy is not following US law. They are using tax dollars. They\\u2019re funding abortion tourism, which is not an appropriate thing for the military to be doing. He said: Day one as commander-in-chief, that policy will go out the window. Tuberville, the Republican senator for Alabama, mounted his obstruction effort earlier this year. He is seeking the end of Department of Defense policy that provides paid time off and covers travel costs for servicewomen and dependents in need of abortion services. Tuberville\\u2019s blockade has so far impacted nearly 300 military promotions, according to the Hill. The Pentagon has said more than 650 leadership positions could be vacant by the end of the year. Joe Biden and the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said last week that the senator\\u2019s hold is jeopardising US national security.\\n\\n\\n\\n5d ago 15.38 EDT Maya Yang Texas women who were denied abortions took the stand and delivered harrowing testimonies of their experiences of carrying life-threatening pregnancies as a result of the state\\u2019s highly restrictive abortion laws. The women are part of a lawsuit filed in March by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is seeking clarification on which situations fall under the \\u201cmedical emergency\\u201d exception in Texas\\u2019s abortion bans. The lawsuit appears to be the first of its kind where women who were denied abortions are suing a state since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade last year. During Wednesday\\u2019s hearing, plaintiff Samantha Casiano delivered an emotional testimony about being forced to give birth to a baby who died four hours later as a result of a fatal birth defect. Twenty weeks into her pregnancy, Casiano discovered that her baby had anencephaly, a rare condition in which parts of the baby\\u2019s skull and brain are missing. Casiano said that doctors informed her that they were unable to perform an abortion in the state and that she was instead given funeral home information. \\u201cI felt like I was abandoned,\\u201d Casiano said. I had this funeral home paper and this is just supposed to be a scan day. Casiano went on to describe her thought processes upon learning about her baby\\u2019s defect, telling the court that she considered getting an abortion out of state but was also afraid of losing her job or being jailed. She said: I felt like I was imprisoned in my own body. At one point, as Casiano read aloud a doctor\\u2019s note about her high-risk pregnancy, she became overwhelmed and vomited during the hearing. Following a recess, Casiano returned to the stand and said that recalling the events \\u201cjust makes my body remember, and it just reacts\\u201d. She added: I now have a psychiatrist \\u2026 I now vomit a lot more. I\\u2019ve never vomited before like that, ever, before my pregnancy. My body\\u2019s never reacted that way.

William Russell, a former White House aide who continued to work for Trump after he left office, was at a federal courthouse in Washington to testify before the grand jury convened by special counsel Jack Smith. Russell was asked to appear on Thursday after making previous grand jury appearances, the Washington Post reported. According to the paper, a data expert who worked on the 2020 election was also scheduled to appear before a grand jury. In addition, Smith\\u2019s team are reportedly in the process of scheduling a grand jury appearance by Bernard Kerik, a former New York city police commissioner who worked with Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in the effort to overturn the election results.\\n\\n\\n\\n5d ago 14.54 EDT Senate committee approves new supreme court ethics rules The Democratic-led Senate judiciary committee voted to advance a supreme court ethics reform bill that would tighten financial disclosures and bolster recusal requirements for justices.

The legislation has little chance to make it through the full Senate and in a divided Congress.\\n\\n\\n\\n5d ago 14.35 EDT Donald Trump\\u2019s court dates are set to clash with the Republican primary calendar. The former president faces three civil trials in New York, one to begin in October and two in January. The clash is raising extraordinary and unprecedented questions about the logistical, legal and political challenges of various trials unfolding against the backdrop of a presidential campaign, according to the New York Times. The paper cites Bruce Green, a Fordham University professor and former prosecutor, as saying: The courts will have to decide how to balance the public interest in having expeditious trials against Trump\\u2019s interest and the public interest in his being able to campaign so that the democratic process works. That\\u2019s a type of complexity that courts have never had to deal with before.\\n\\n\\n\\n5d ago 14.22 EDT Martin Pengelly In polling averages for the Republican primary, Donald Trump leads by about 30 points. He has maintained that lead even while facing 34 criminal charges in New York, over hush-money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels; 37 federal charges over his retention of classified documents; the prospect of state and federal indictments over his election subversion; a $5m fine after being held liable for sexual abuse and defamation against the writer E Jean Carroll; and ongoing investigations of his business affairs. Denying all wrongdoing, Trump has pleaded not guilty to all criminal charges. Nonetheless, polling regarding a notional general election shows him in a close race with Joe Biden. Earlier this week, Miles Taylor, who was a US homeland security official when in 2018 he wrote a famous anonymous New York Times column warning of Trump\\u2019s unfitness for office, told the Guardian Trump could yet return to the White House. \\u201cThere\\u2019s been a number of polls that show the ex-president beating Joe Biden by several points,\\u201d Taylor said. It would be hubris to say, \\u2018Oh, no, we would beat him again a second time.\\u2019 Actually, I don\\u2019t think that. If the election was held today, I think Donald Trump would defeat Joe Biden, and that really concerns me. Taylor also pointed to the supine nature of the Republican party, saying McCarthy, the House speaker, \\u201cthought Trump was a buffoon and a danger and I\\u2019m sure Kevin still thinks that privately\\u201d but is unwilling, or unable, to move in any way against him. Taylor said: Those people publicly, because they\\u2019re afraid, are still supporting the man. That collective anonymity is putting us in pretty seriously great danger.\\n\\n\\n\\n5d ago 14.06 EDT Martin Pengelly Donald Trump faced a deadline of midnight on Thursday to say if he would appear before a Washington grand jury convened by the special counsel Jack Smith to consider federal charges over his election subversion and incitement of the attack on Congress on 6 January 2021. Late on Wednesday, citing two people familiar with the matter, the Guardian reported that prosecutors had assembled evidence to charge Trump with three crimes. They were: obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and an unusual statute that makes it unlawful to conspire to violate civil rights. Obstruction of an official proceeding is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Conspiracy to defraud the United States carries a maximum five-year sentence. The civil rights charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. By Thursday afternoon, all indications were that Trump would not agree to testify.\\n\\n\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Rich Tenorio\", \"title\": \"The Big Break: Ben Terris on his portrait of Washington after Trump\", \"description\": \"The Washington Post reporter discusses his tale of pollsters, chancers, gamblers and more in a capital rocked to its coreIf you were a pollster, would you ever bet on elections?

For Sean McElwee, the wunderkind behind the liberal polling group Data for Progress, the answer was all the above.\\n\\nMcElwee had clients including the 2022 Senate campaign of John Fetterman, in Pennsylvania. McElwee placed multiple bets on the midterms, including that Fetterman would lose. Fetterman\\u2019s organization became displeased. Following its victory, it severed ties with McElwee. It was just the beginning of a dramatic downfall heightened by the pollster\\u2019s connections to the pandemic-prevention advocate Gabe Bankman-Fried, whose billionaire brother Sam Bankman-Fried\\u2019s crypto empire collapsed in scandal around election day.\\n\\nThe rise and fall of Sean McElwee is one of many storylines in a new book The Big Break: The Gamblers, Party Animals and True Believers Trying to Win in Washington While America Loses its Mind. For the author, the Washington Post reporter Ben Terris, the individuals he profiles tell a collective story about DC processing the fallout from the Trump years.\\n\\n\\u201cNobody knew what the world was going to be like post-Trump,\\u201d Terris says, adding: \\u201cIf there is a post-Trump.\\u201d\\n\\nTo explore that world, he turned to Democratic and Republican circles: Leah Hunt-Hendrix, an oil heiress turned funder of progressive causes, whose conservative grandfather HL Hunt was reportedly the world\\u2019s wealthiest man; Matt and Mercedes Schlapp, a Republican power couple whose fortunes crested after Matt decided to stick with Trump in 2016; Ian Walters, Matt\\u2019s protege until political and personal differences ruptured the friendship; Robert Stryk, a cowboy-hatted lobbyist who parlayed Trump connections into a lucrative career representing sometimes questionable clients; and Jamarcus Purley, a Black staffer for the Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein who lamented the impact of George Floyd\\u2019s murder and the pandemic on Black Americans including his own father, who died. Disenchanted with his boss, Purley lost his job in disputed circumstances and launched an unconventional protest in Feinstein\\u2019s Capitol office, after hours.\\n\\nTerris is a reporter for the Post\\u2019s Style section, which he characterizes as strong on features and profiles. He can turn a phrase, likening Fetterman to \\u201ca Tolkien character in Carhartt\\u201d, and has an ear for the telling quote. Once, while Terris was covering the Democratic senator Jon Tester, from Montana, in, of all places, an organic pea field, nature called. A staffer asked: \\u201cCan the senator\\u2019s penis please be off the record?\\u201d Terris quips that he\\u2019s saving this for a title if he ever writes a memoir.\\n\\nHis current book is \\u201csort of a travelog, not a memoir\\u201d, Terris says. \\u201cI tried to keep myself out of the book as much as I could. I wanted the reader to feel like they knew Washington, knew the weirdos, the odd scenes \\u2026 the backrooms, poker games, parties.\\u201d\\n\\nHunt-Hendrix\\u2019s Christmas party is among the opening scenes. Attendees include her aunt Swanee Hunt, a former ambassador to Austria. Hunt-Hendrix aimed to make her own mark, through her organization Way to Win.\\n\\n\\u201cShe\\u2019s very progressive,\\u201d Terris says, \\u201ctrying to unwind a lot of projects, in a way, that her grandfather was all about. To me, it was fascinating, the family dynamics at play.\\u201d\\n\\nJust as fascinating was her \\u201cfiguring out how to push the [Democratic] party in the direction she believed it should go in \\u2013 a more progressive direction than some Democrats pushed for. It told the story of Democratic party tensions \\u2013 money and politics, the idea of being idealistic and also super-wealthy \\u2026 All of these things made for a very heady brew.\\u201d\\n\\nOn the Republican side, Stryk went from running a vineyard to savoring fine wine in a foreign embassy, thanks to his connection to Trump. Stryk joined the campaign in 2016. When Trump won, Stryk celebrated on a patio of the Four Seasons hotel in DC. A dog sniffed his crotch. When its owner apologized, Stryk found she worked for the New Zealand embassy, which was having difficulty reaching Trump. It was Stryk\\u2019s lucky break.\\n\\n\\u201cHe was in a position to connect New Zealand to Trump,\\u201d Terris says. \\u201cHe got a phone number and was off to the races, a sideshow guy making major deals \\u2026 $5m with the Saudis, that kind of thing.\\u201d\\n\\nWhen Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last year, Stryk was in Belarus, exploring a potential relationship with that country\\u2019s government. He had to make his way home via the Baltics.\\n\\n\\u201cOne of the themes of the book is that the Donald Trump era allowed a bunch of sideshow characters to get out on the main stage,\\u201d Terris says. \\u201cStryk is a great example of that.\\u201d\\n\\nOthers distanced themselves \\u2013 eventually. Terris sees the rupture between Matt Schlapp and Ian Walters as illustrative. As head of the American Conservative Union, Schlapp presided over CPAC, the annual conservative conference, with Walters his communications director. As Schlapp welcomed fringe elements to CPAC \\u2013 from Trump to Matt Gaetz to Marjorie Taylor Greene \\u2013 Walters felt increasingly repelled.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s an interesting tale of a broken friendship,\\u201d Terris says. \\u201cIt also helps the reader understand how did the Republican party get to where it is now \\u2013 where are the fault lines, why one way over another.\\u201d\\n\\nThe 2020 election was the point of no return. Schlapp stayed all-in on Trump, supporting his claim of a stolen election even in a graveside speech at the funeral of Walters\\u2019s father, the legendary conservative journalist Ralph Hallow.\\n\\n\\u201cWe have to take confidence that he would want us, more than anything else, to get beyond this period of mourning and to fight,\\u201d Schlapp is quoted as saying. Walters and his wife, Carin, resigned from the ACU. Ian remained a Republican but marveled at the bravery of the whistleblower Cassidy Hutchinson in the January 6 hearings.\\n\\nAs for Schlapp, he faced scandal late last year. Assisting with the Senate campaign of the ex-football star Herschel Walker, when Schlapp arrived in Georgia, he allegedly groped a male campaign staffer.\\n\\nDonald Trump shakes hands with Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, at CPAC in 2020. Photograph: Yuri Gripas/Reuters\\n\\n\\u201cI had to go back into my reporting and ask, were there signs of this?\\u201d recalls Terris. \\u201cCould I run through all of this [with] the alleged victim over the phone? I did. I ran a bunch of questions by Matt \\u2013 he never answered.\\u201d\\n\\nThere was another last-minute controversy. McElwee\\u2019s polls proved inaccurate. Another red flag was his ties to Gabe Bankman-Fried, whose brother was arrested in December. Reports of McElwee\\u2019s gambling made clients wonder where their money was going. Senior staff threatened to resign. McElwee stepped down.\\n\\n\\u201cAll of a sudden, it was national news in a way I was not prepared for,\\u201d Terris says.\\n\\nCan anyone be prepared for what comes next in Washington?\\n\\n\\u201cDonald Trump proved you can win by acting like Donald Trump,\\u201d Terris says. \\u201cThere are a lot of people that learned from him \\u2013 mostly in the Republican party, but [also] the Democratic party \\u2013 how to comport yourself in Washington, what you can get away with.

If the government feels the restrictions aren\\u2019t enough, they can decide whether they still want to continue with the case.\\n\\nWhile Cipa established a mechanism through which the government can safely charge cases involving classified documents, the series of steps that have to be followed means it takes longer to get to trial compared with regular criminal cases without national security implications.\\n\\nCipa also requires the defense to review all classified materials and draft briefs in an ultra-secure room designed to handle secret documents called a sensitive compartmented information facility (Scif). If the only Scif is in Miami, just the back-and-forth travel could necessitate a slower schedule.\\n\\nThe prosecutors in the Trump case have indicated they want to get to trial quickly, but the complexities of Cipa and Trump\\u2019s clear preference for delay \\u2013 if he wins the election before it gets to trial, the case may be dropped \\u2013 could significantly push back the government\\u2019s proposed timetable.\\n\\nTo that end, the timetable amounts to more of a signal from prosecutors that they believe they would be ready to take the Trump case to trial before the end of the year, than a realistic schedule, since it will be subject to multiple hurdles, as identified by legal experts familiar with the process.\\n\\nTrump\\u2019s lawyers can challenge the protective order for classified discovery by asking Cannon for an exemption \\u2013 potentially to extend access to Trump himself.

That date suggests she will pursue a slower schedule than proposed by the government, which had sought to get the hearing done and start the discovery of classified documents by 10 July.\\n\\nCipa section 3: classified discovery\\n\\nJust like in any other case, the government is required to provide to the defense all materials they intend to use at trial \\u2013 including the classified documents.

Since that motion would govern the extent of the classified discovery, the Trump legal team may use it as a pretext to push back filing their section 5 notice (explained next).\\n\\nCipa section 5: notice from Trump\\n\\nAfter the classified discovery is complete, section 5 requires the Trump legal team to file a notice specifying the precise classified information they intend to disclose at trial, including a \\u201cbrief description of the classified information\\u201d.\\n\\nAccording to legal experts, the defense at this juncture typically files a notice that the government finds too vague \\u2013 a problem because it reduces the notice to \\u201cgraymail\\u201d in writing \\u2013 and the Trump legal team could do the same in this case.\\n\\nIn that event, the government would have to ask Cannon to force Trump to produce a more specific section 5 notice, pushing back the proposed deadline of 12 September multiple weeks after adding up the delays in section 4 and 5.\\n\\nCipa section 6(a): trial admissibility\\n\\nTwenty-one days after Trump\\u2019s section 5 notice, the government has said it would be ready to file a motion asking Cannon to schedule a hearing under section 6(a) of the statute to adjudicate the relevance and admissibility of the classified information Trump wants to disclose at trial.\\n\\nThe government then suggests the Trump legal team get two weeks to file a response to the section 6 motion, for the government to get a week to file a reply to Trump\\u2019s response, and for Cannon to schedule the hearing to come seven days after the government\\u2019s reply.\\n\\nThe proposed timetable suggests the hearing takes place on 31 October, though earlier cumulative delays may push it back months, potentially to December.\\n\\nAt the hearing, Cannon would consider whether the Trump legal team needs the classified information that it outlined in its section 5 notice to make an effective defense against any potential objections from prosecutors who might want to limit the extent of the disclosure at trial.\\n\\nCannon would make a determination on each item of classified information. Her final ruling might not come down for days after the hearing, not least because she may choose to look through all of the classified documents and classified discovery herself to reach a decision.\\n\\nIf US judge Aileen Cannon rules that Trump can use the classified documents he wants at trial, the government can appeal to the 11th circuit appeals court. Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA\\n\\nCipa section 6(c): redactions for trial\\n\\nIf Cannon decides in her discretion that Trump can use all the classified information he wants at trial, section 6(c) says the government can propose to Cannon that Trump instead use unclassified \\u201csubstitutes\\u201d or, more commonly, redacted versions of the documents.\\n\\nThe substitutes can either be a statement admitting relevant facts that the classified information would prove, or a summary of the classified information instead of the classified documents themselves.\\n\\nBut Trump could challenge any redactions on the basis that a jury could draw a prejudicial inference from them \\u2013 they might see the redactions as evidence the document is sensitive \\u2013 and Cannon is not required to accept the government\\u2019s proposal for substitutions.\\n\\nCipa section 7: final appeals\\n\\nIf Cannon rejects restrictions sought by the government, prosecutors can appeal under section 7 to the US court of appeals for the 11th circuit. If the appeals court also rules against the government, the attorney general must decide whether to continue the prosecution or drop elements of the case.\\n\\nThe proposed timetable from the government suggests a section 6 hearing on 5 December. But the holidays and potential challenges from Trump may push a hearing back into the start of 2024. A final decision about what Trump can use at trial might not come until weeks afterwards.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Guardian staff and agencies\", \"title\": \"Rudy Giuliani should be disbarred over 2020 election, DC panel recommends\", \"description\": \"Washington DC committee recommends revoking former New York City mayor\\u2019s law license over attempt to overturn electionRudy Giuliani\\u2019s law license should be revoked over his work on a failed lawsuit challenging the 2020 election results on behalf of then presi\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/08/rudy-giuliani-disbarred-2020-election-recommendation\", \"text\": \"Rudy Giuliani\\u2019s law license should be revoked over his work on a failed lawsuit challenging the 2020 election results on behalf of then president Donald Trump, a Washington attorney ethics committee has recommended.\\n\\nHe now faces being disbarred in the capital after the review panel late on Friday condemned the lawyer and ex-politician for aggressively pursuing the false assertions Trump made about his defeat by Democratic rival and now US president Joe Biden.\\n\\nGiuliani \\u201cclaimed massive election fraud but had no evidence\\u201d, wrote the three-member panel in a report that details the errors and unsupported claims the former mayor of New York City made in a Pennsylvania lawsuit seeking to overturn the election result.\\n\\nBetween the November 2020 election day and the January 6 insurrection by supporters of Trump at the US Capitol, Giuliani and other Trump lawyers repeatedly pressed claims of election fraud that were untrue and almost uniformly rejected by federal and state courts.\\n\\nHe is the third lawyer who could lose his ability to practice law over what he did for Trump: John Eastman faces disbarment in California, and Lin Wood this week surrendered his license in Georgia.\\n\\n\\u201cMr Giuliani\\u2019s effort to undermine the integrity of the 2020 presidential election has helped destabilize our democracy,\\u201d wrote the panel members, Robert Bernius, Carolyn Haynesworth-Murrell and Jay Brozost.\\n\\n\\u201cThe misconduct here sadly transcends all his past accomplishments,\\u201d they wrote. \\u201cIt was unparalleled in its destructive purpose and effect.

They were there on behalf of the centrist political advocacy organization No Labels, which is considering fielding a third-party ticket in the 2024 presidential election, and had enlisted the two men to debut its 67-page policy manifesto.\\n\\nEarly on in the evening, the moderator asked the question looming over the event: were Manchin and Huntsman running for president? After a smattering of applause died down, Manchin deflected, saying they were simply there to \\u201cexplain to you that we need options\\u201d. But Manchin\\u2019s refusal to announce whether he will seek re-election for the US Senate next year, and his presence at the town hall, has drawn speculation that he and No Labels may combine to upend the 2024 election.\\n\\nNo Labels has been around since 2010, largely promoting centrist policies and occasionally working to elect moderate Democrats to Congress. Its recent ambitions are far grander, as it plans to raise $70m, get on the ballot in every state across the country, and build a third-party ticket for the presidency. The group has become a specter looming over the 2024 election for Democrats, with polls showing that a centrist third-party candidate would draw votes away from Joe Biden and tilt the race toward Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe growing prominence of No Labels and its potential to run a third-party candidate has resulted in backlash from Democrats and more centrist Republicans as a result. Democratic representatives and political organizations such as MoveOn have mobilized to oppose the group, including holding briefings for congressional staffers on the risk of a third-party ticket. Democratic and Republican strategists additionally commissioned a poll that showed how an independent centrist candidate would act as a spoiler against Biden.\\n\\nBut efforts to show that No Labels could take a significant portion of the vote and effectively hand Trump the presidency have only emboldened the group. No Labels\\u2019 chief pollster told Axios that the recent survey \\u2013 which showed a moderate independent candidate would receive around 20% of the vote and shift the election to Trump \\u2013 was proof that their strategy was sound and that they had a viable chance at the presidency.\\n\\n\\u201cThe people who are spearheading this are not doing it cynically. They have convinced themselves that this is a unique historical moment and they intend to seize it,\\u201d said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who co-founded No Labels in 2010 before leaving it earlier this year.\\n\\nGalston disagreed with the group\\u2019s decision in 2022 to focus on fielding a third-party candidate, he said, and after a year of offering arguments against the shift decided to quit the organization in April of this year. Although he still supports the group, he sees its current mission as misguided and has spoken out about how it\\u2019s likely to benefit Trump\\u2019s presidential hopes.\\n\\nDonald Trump at the Turning Point Action USA conference in West Palm Beach, Florida last Saturday. Photograph: Giorgio Viera/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\n\\u201cI could not go along with the formation of an independent ticket,\\u201d Galston said. \\u201cI saw no equivalence between Donald Trump and Joe Biden and feared that this ticket would, on net, draw support away from Biden\\u2019s candidacy.\\u201d\\n\\nNo Labels, and its potential candidate Manchin, reject the notion that they will act as spoilers. The group has claimed it will not go ahead with its plans if it appears to shift the election to one party, though has been vague on its criteria for such a decision, and Manchin on Monday told the audience in New Hampshire that \\u201cif I get in a race I\\u2019m gonna win\\u201d.\\n\\nUndisclosed donors\\n\\nAs No Labels moves forward with its fundraising and attempts to get on nationwide ballots, it has faced increased scrutiny over who exactly is backing their efforts. The group refuses to disclose its donors, which it is not obligated to do, but a Mother Jones investigation identified dozens of wealthy contributors affiliated with No Labels.\\n\\nAlthough it includes several major Democratic donors, many of the contributors favor conservative causes and Republican candidates. A separate investigation from the New Republic found that conservative billionaire Harlan Crow, most recently known for his close ties with the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, donated $130,000 to the group between 2019 and 2021.\\n\\nNo Labels officials have cited privacy concerns as the reason that the group will not release its donors, while its chief executive, Nancy Jacobson, told NBC News this week that there was \\u201cnothing nefarious\\u201d about its fundraising. Galston brought up to Jacobson in the early days of the group\\u2019s operations that a lack of transparency might become an issue, he said, but she told him \\u201cin no uncertain terms\\u201d that was how things would be run.\\n\\nJacobson and No Labels did not respond to a request for comment on this article.\\n\\nIt is unclear just how much of its $70m goal No Labels has raised, although previous years and Jacobson\\u2019s status as veteran fundraiser show that it is able to draw large sums. No Labels\\u2019 2021 tax forms, the most recent year publicly available, state that it took in just over $11.3m in revenue that year. The organization\\u2019s highest-paid staffer was the former political commentator Mark Halperin, according to the 2021 tax form, who made about $257,000 as No Labels\\u2019 chief strategist. The organization hired Halperin despite allegations from multiple women of sexual harassment and assault against the once-prominent journalist. Halperin, who has previously apologized for some of the harassment allegations against him while denying other allegations including physical assault, left No Labels in March of this year. He could not be reached for comment.\\n\\nThe tax forms also show that No Labels paid top Democrat-run consulting firms for their advocacy and communications work. It gave around $946,000 in compensation to the communications firm Rational 360 in 2021. Rational 360 did not respond to a request for comment on this article.\\n\\nThe group has faced criticism from Democrats before, including when it endorsed an anti-LGBT, anti-abortion Illinois congressman during the 2018 midterms. A Super Pac tied to No Labels spent about $1m backing the campaign, according to the Intercept. But previous backlash against the group is nothing compared towithwhat it currently faces, with growing concern among Democrats that No Labels has the potential to lose them the White House.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s pretty clear that a No Labels candidate would help re-elect Donald Trump,\\u201d the Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen told the Hill.\\n\\nNo Labels has given itself until Super Tuesday \\u2013 when a large number of states hold primaries in early March of next year \\u2013 as a deadline for announcing whether or not it will run a third party.

That was the word he hid behind in writing a damning essay in the New York Times from inside Donald Trump\\u2019s White House and a subsequent book.\\n\\nToday, Taylor is speaking openly to anyone who will listen. The 35-year-old conducts part of a phone interview with the Guardian while boarding a flight from Chicago to north-west Michigan. At one point he breaks off to make sure two fellow passengers get to sit together. With the grateful couple safely ensconced, Taylor carries on talking. What if his unvarnished views on the former president trigger a display of Maga air rage?\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s been my experience the past couple of years that when someone notices you and they come over and say, \\u2018Are you such and such person?\\u2019, you don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s going to be someone who says thank you for what you did or someone spits in your face and tries to punch you. So yeah, I try to lower my voice in public.\\u201d\\n\\nEven so, Taylor has proudly attached his name to a second book, Blowback: A Warning to Save Democracy from the Next Trump, which combines raw politics with uncomfortable disclosures from his own life. Showing the zeal of a convert, the man who for a time was at the centre of the biggest mystery in Washington has become an apostle of radical transparency. With Trump once again charging towards the White House and vowing revenge, Taylor sees the cloak of anonymity he once embraced as a fundamental threat to democracy.\\n\\nTaylor insists he hates politics but was inspired to work in government after the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. He started in the George W Bush administration and was a senior aide on Capitol Hill. After Trump\\u2019s election he joined the homeland security department, eventually becoming chief of staff to the secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen.\\n\\nIn September 2018, Taylor wrote his column in the Times, under the headline \\u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration\\u201d. The article made public what cabinet members were saying in private: Trump was unstable and unfit.\\n\\nGuessing the identity of the author became a Washington parlour game, with Trump demanding the Times unmask him (\\u201cTREASON?\\u201d he tweeted). Taylor quit the administration and followed up with a book, A Warning, attributed to \\u201cAnonymous: A Senior Trump Administration Official\\u201d, another chronicle of incompetence and malevolence in the White House.\\n\\nYet he was finding the secrecy an unbearable burden and, after much agonising, unmasked himself in October 2020.\\n\\nHe recalls: \\u201cIt\\u2019s obviously very ironic coming from me but, in the aftermath of all of that, I came to the conclusion that the biggest threat to our democracy was anonymity.\\n\\n\\u201cThe people who most needed to come forward and tell the truth were cowed into silence, including me. I thought anonymously sounding the alarm about the president would draw attention to the message instead of the messenger and always intended to unveil myself. But in the aftermath I realised I really should have done that a lot sooner both for political reasons and personal reasons.\\u201d\\n\\nPolitically, he believes, coming forward sooner would have given more people cover to do the same. When Taylor went public ahead of the 2020 election, it proved helpful in recruiting what would be the biggest alliance of ex-officials in US history to campaign against the president who appointed them.\\n\\n\\u201cBut then personally, the living two lives was an enormous stressor on my psyche and my life. The pressure to come forward or not? Frankly, at the core of it, the reason why I delayed was fear and, as I dove deeper into myself, it felt like cowardice because I saw what happened to people who went against Trump. While I convinced myself, \\u2018Look, you\\u2019re going to unmask yourself eventually,\\u2019 I was hesitant in that time after the publication of the op-ed and the book, because I didn\\u2019t want my life ripped to shreds. But ultimately, I felt I really had to do that,\\u201d he says.\\n\\nTo manage anxiety attacks, Taylor abused alcohol and prescription drugs. He was hospitalised after overdosing on caffeine, alcohol, marijuana and Xanax, at levels that had killed other patients. After revealing his identity, he received death threats, took on a bodyguard and was forced to shuttle between safe houses.\\n\\nTaylor now writes: \\u201cThe public fight against Donald Trump cost me my home, my job and savings, friendships, a relationship, and my family\\u2019s security, temporarily putting me on the run. Late one evening in a Virginia high-rise, it also nearly cost me my life.\\u201d\\n\\nThis last point is a reference to how, alone with a gun on election night in 2020, Taylor contemplated shooting himself. Now, sober for nearly 18 months, he sees the experience as metaphor for the US in the Trump era.\\n\\nThe flirtation with putting another hyper-populist far-right person in the White House is effectively civic suicidal ideation\\n\\nHe says: \\u201cThe ways that we individually, if we ignore our guardrails, can end up causing ourselves to drift towards self-destruction and similarly, as a democracy, ignoring those guardrails is effectively suicidal ideation. That\\u2019s what we are as a country grappling with right now.\\n\\n\\u201cThe flirtation with putting another hyper-populist far-right person in the White House is effectively civic suicidal ideation. In the course of writing this, the personal guardrails being ripped off in my life looked an awful lot like what\\u2019s happening right now where our collective silence, at least in the Republican party, about this guy is leading us potentially towards self-destruction.\\n\\n\\u201cNow, that\\u2019s not to say that there aren\\u2019t people sounding the alarm but, by and large, the leading figures of the Republican party refuse to repudiate this man and continue to support him. We are doing this again, even though those people say privately he\\u2019s a threat.\\u201d\\n\\nTaylor accompanies Kirstjen Nielsen, then homeland security secretary, in a meeting in Honduras in March 2018. Photograph: Tim Godbee/AP\\n\\nTaylor offers the example of Kevin McCarthy, the House speaker whom Taylor used to meet weekly.\\n\\n\\u201cHe thought Trump was a buffoon and a danger and I\\u2019m sure Kevin still thinks that privately. Those people publicly, because they\\u2019re afraid, are still supporting the man. That collective anonymity is putting us in pretty seriously great danger.\\u201d\\n\\nIn November 2020, the journalist Carl Bernstein listed 21 Republican senators he said had \\u201crepeatedly expressed contempt\\u201d for Trump. Many Republicans on Capitol Hill have confided in reporters about such disdain, generating countless stories. But few ever go on the record. Taylor talked to many of them for his book.\\n\\n\\u201cSome of the people who were incredibly critical of me for publishing anonymous critiques of the president are the same people who when I interviewed them, asked that I not use their names so that they could speak candidly. They asked if they could be anonymous in the book. You can\\u2019t even make that shit up: that\\u2019s insane hypocrisy,\\u201d he says.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd after I submitted to the publisher, I went back to some of these people multiple times and said, \\u2018I really think you should consider letting me put you on the record here. Let\\u2019s make this an opportunity for you to be on the record pushing back against this.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, no, no, no, no. It doesn\\u2019t make sense right now. I\\u2019m better positioned in my job in Congress or within the party to steer the direction.\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201cTo them I would say: I thought the same thing and was completely fucking wrong because we weren\\u2019t able to steer in the right direction. Look, you guys aren\\u2019t having an effect. He\\u2019s still dominating. Stop fooling yourselves. The best impact you can have will be to speak out from within the tribe because it is air cover for other people to do the same. I\\u2019m afraid we\\u2019re sleepwalking back into the exact same mistakes we made last time and that\\u2019s why I called this Blowback.\\u201d\\n\\nOn or off the record, Taylor\\u2019s sources shared horror stories to add to his own. Trump allegedly sought to tap aides\\u2019 phones in an attempt to catch leakers. He was said to have viewed military veterans as \\u201clazy malingerers\\u201d and planned to destroy the $250bn veterans\\u2019 social safety net so he could spend the money elsewhere. He put his own government on edge about the prospect of nuclear war.\\n\\nTaylor recalls: \\u201cOfficials were so worried that the president would accidentally lead us into a nuclear war with North Korea that, for the first time in the history of the Department of Homeland Security, we convened every single leader to talk through actual real-life preparations for what we might have to do if we ended up in a nuclear conflict with another nation state. I will tell you that, in the wake of those preparatory meetings, I felt like we were woefully unprepared as a country to enter that type of conflict, which made it all the more reckless that Trump was being so bellicose with regard to the North Koreans.\\u201d\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Guardian Headlines US Free newsletter For US readers, we offer a regional edition of our daily email, delivering the most important headlines every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aides mused about using American firepower against helpless migrants.\\n\\nTaylor writes: \\u201cOn the flight back to Washington DC, Trump adviser Stephen Miller took a seat next to me to float an idea. Across from us at a small table sat the commandant of the coast guard, Adm Paul Zukunft. \\u2018Admiral, the military has aerial drones, correct?\\u2019 Stephen inquired. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 Zukunft replied. \\u2018And some of those drones are equipped with missiles, correct?\\u2019\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2018Sure,\\u2019 the commandant answered, clearly wondering where the line of questioning was going. \\u2018And when a boat full of migrants is in international waters, they aren\\u2019t protected by the US constitution, right?\\u2019 \\u2018Technically, no, but I\\u2019m not sure what you\\u2019re getting at.\\u2019 \\u2018Tell me why, then, can\\u2019t we use a Predator drone to obliterate that boat?\\u2019 Adm Zukunft looked nonplussed. \\u2018Because, Stephen, it would be against international law.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nAll of it, Taylor warns, would be far worse under \\u201cTrump 2.0\\u201d, with guardrails gone and third-rate officials in place. Taylor fears Trump could use secret powers known by national security officials as \\u201cthe doomsday book\\u201d to manipulate elections and satisfy his authoritarian impulses.\\n\\nHe says: \\u201cThe aides that guarded that book were concerned about the president reading it, or Maga allies around him getting ahold of it, because especially towards the end of the administration, they witnessed the president\\u2019s proclivity to abuse his authorities for political purposes, and especially as he started to signal that the 2020 election might be stolen or he could be cheated, those same people were concerned about Trump realising he had even more extraordinary powers than he knew and that he might potentially use those to cement a coup.\\u201d\\n\\nThe US dodged a bullet: the doomsday book almost fell into the hands of Christina Bobb, a Trump lawyer, election denier and former host on the far-right One America News Network.\\n\\n\\u201cI have no doubt that she would have taken the doomsday book to Trump and said, \\u2018Wait a second, look at all of the classified emergency powers we could use to make sure that power is not transferred to Joe Biden.\\u2019 That\\u2019s pretty terrifying,\\u201d Taylor says.\\n\\n\\u201cIn a second term, Trump will be very much aware that exists and I suspect from day one they\\u2019ll want to get their hands on it and see what tools we in the American public aren\\u2019t aware of that they could use to further cement a hold on power and disrupt the political process.\\u201d\\n\\nIn Blowback, Trump\\u2019s vulgar sexism also comes under scrutiny. Taylor recounts how the president made lewd comments about his own family members. He writes: \\u201cAides said he talked about Ivanka Trump\\u2019s breasts, her backside, and what it might be like to have sex with her, remarks that once led [then chief of staff] John Kelly to remind the president that Ivanka was his daughter. Afterward, Kelly retold the story to me in visible disgust. Trump, he said, was \\u2018a very, very evil man.\\u2019\\u201d\\n\\nTrump was not beyond \\u201clocker room talk\\u201d at national security meetings. Taylor says: \\u201cHe would critique women about their looks on their television appearances and their bodies, including my own boss, Kirstjen Nielsen, at one point, and that was incredibly off-putting. There\\u2019s an anecdote I tell in the book about him joking about [press secretary] Sarah Sanders\\u2019 weight.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve got to think that people who are still hardcore supporters of Trump\\u2019s will at least draw the line at incest fantasies\\n\\n\\u201cBut the comments about his own daughter were the most disgusting. I debated actually whether to even include those anecdotes in the book because they are so graphic and disgusting. But I\\u2019ve got to think, or hope at least, that people who are still hardcore supporters of his, who\\u2019ve stuck with him through impeachments and indictments, will at least draw the line at incest fantasies.\\n\\nIvanka Trump speaks at a campaign event while her father, Donald Trump, watches in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Photograph: Morry Gash/AP\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s got to be a point that you just decide, no matter how much you like someone\\u2019s policies, that their character is so vile that you can\\u2019t support them. So I ultimately decided to put that in there to talk about his misogynistic behaviour because I think it\\u2019s reflective of the way he conducts himself as commander-in-chief. You can\\u2019t firewall those two things from each other. He can\\u2019t be a disgusting person in his private life and a paragon virtue in his public life. That doesn\\u2019t exist. Those private behaviours lead to public danger.\\u201d\\n\\nThat much should have been clear in 2016, when the public learned of the Access Hollywood tape, on which Trump boasted about grabbing women\\u2019s genitals, and elected him anyway. He has always been the opposite of anonymous, a celebrity flaunting his vices in plain sight. Taylor thinks 2016 might be happening again.\\n\\nTaylor says: \\u201cThere\\u2019s been a number of polls that show the ex-president beating Joe Biden by several points. It would be hubris to say, \\u2018Oh, no, we would beat him again a second time.\\u2019 Actually, I don\\u2019t think that. If the election was held today, I think Donald Trump would defeat Joe Biden, and that really concerns me.\\u201d\\n\\nTaylor proposes harsh medicine few Democrats would be willing to swallow: a coalition with moderate Republicans, perhaps even with the former congresswoman Liz Cheney replacing Kamala Harris as Biden\\u2019s running mate.\\n\\n\\u201cThe single best jump to beat Trump is a unity coalition that Biden would undertake to form. He talked a lot about bringing Republicans into his administration in the first term. Not a whole lot came in. He needs to bring someone to the top of the ticket to show he would govern for the first time in American history as a unity president with a unity administration. That\\u2019s maybe his only shot to decisively beat Donald Trump,\\u201d he says.\\n\\nTaylor\\u2019s plane is about to take off. After celebrating his father\\u2019s 80th birthday in Michigan, he will head to a memorial service for a family member who died at 95.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m taking heart in the fact that I\\u2019ve got family members that are living so long,\\u201d he says, philosophically. \\u201cHopefully that means something for me. The stupid situation that I keep putting myself in in going against these political crazies probably is not terribly good for my lifespan.

There are the texts between various Trump underlings and Walt Nauta, the Trump body man who has also been indicted, showing the president directing his employees to move the boxes containing classified information back and forth to various locations around his properties in Palm Beach and Bedminster, New Jersey. There is the annoyed missive from Trump\\u2019s wife Melania, trying to make sure the boxes don\\u2019t crowd out room for her luggage on a private plane. There is the claim from Trump\\u2019s former attorney, compelled to testify against him in an unusual arrangement, that the former president suggested, with a Grinch-like pinching gesture, that the lawyer destroy confidential documents to prevent them from being produced in a subpoena. There is a text message Nauta sent to another Trump underling, showing a box having fallen over in a storage room at Mar-a-Lago, secret documents spilling on to the floor \\u2013 whoops.\\n\\nWhat there is not, conspicuously, is a motive. Over the course of more than a year following his departure from office, it appears that Trump spent considerable effort and resources in transporting the documents with him and keeping them near at hand \\u2013 and that later, as the federal government began to demand the boxes back, that he then went out of his way to keep and conceal them, going to great length, sparing no expense, and ultimately breaking the law so much that he incurred himself a series of felony charges. Anyone can tell you how this behavior is typical of Trump: how it reflects his pettiness, his contempt for the law, his willingness to sacrifice and endanger others. What no one can tell you is why he did it.\\n\\nIt would be more convenient \\u2013 legally, for Jack Smith and his prosecutors, and politically, for Joe Biden, for the Democrats, and for the growing number of Republicans who are looking to challenge Trump in the 2024 Republican primary \\u2013 if we could say precisely why Trump wanted to keep the documents so badly, exactly what he wanted them for. It would be very easy to make a case to a skeptical jury \\u2013 or to a divided American people \\u2013 that Trump was a danger and could not be trusted with national secrets again if it could be said that he wanted to keep the documents for any of the straightforwardly dangerous and nefarious reasons that have been speculated: if he was seeking to sell national security secrets to the Saudis, say, or to Israel; if he was hoping, as some have suggested, that he one day might be able to blackmail someone powerful, like the president of France.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s very possible that Trump had concocted such a plan. There is much that we do not know about the investigations into Trump, including about the special counsel\\u2019s query into his illegal document retention. But we do know that in the past, we know that he has gone further, and risked more, in the pursuit of even more harebrained schemes.\\n\\nBut what seems the most likely explanation is the simplest, stupidest, and most aggravating one: that Trump had no plan for the documents, except perhaps for use as souvenirs, trophies to be shown off, maybe as evidence for petty score-settling. That the documents that Trump smuggled out of the White House and squirreled away around Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster were not instruments in a coherent, well-formed plan, but instead mere ornaments to Trump\\u2019s ego. In transcripts of Trump\\u2019s statements about the documents that were included in the indictment, and in audio of Trump showing some of the secret papers off to a writer that was recently released by CNN, Trump uses the documents to contradict a former national security official he was then in a spat with in the press; he tells one interlocutor not to get too close to one of the secret papers, seeming to want to create a hush of reverence for the documents in place of respecting their confidentiality in the first place. At these moments, Trump does not sound as if he has a plan. He sounds as if he wants to impress the people in the room with him, and like he can think no further ahead than to how good it will feel to get their praise.\\n\\nWhy did Trump want the secret documents? Why did he refuse to return them? The answer may be the one truest to Trump\\u2019s piddling, puerile character: because they looked cool; because they reminded him of his own importance; because the government had asked for them back, and Trump has never missed an opportunity to throw a petulant little tantrum.\\n\\nIt is this smallness of Trump\\u2019s character, and the possible triviality of his motives, that poses a peculiar risk to both of the cases being made against Trump \\u2013 the one being pursued in a Miami courthouse, and the one being pursued in public. Because there has always been an uncanny mismatch with Trump, an incongruence: between the awesome and vast powers he had in office, the historical forces he unleashed on America, and the horrible ways his presidency warped millions of lives, on the one hand; and on the other, his pettiness, his vanity, his short-sightedness, his piddling personal grievances and constant need to be flattered and reassured.\\n\\nThe gap between the seriousness of Trump\\u2019s role in history and his unseriousness as a person is the strange place where the documents case \\u2013 and, now, much of American political thought \\u2013 risks getting stuck.

It\\u2019s no coincidence that these \\u2018banned books\\u2019 are often written by or feature people of colour, Indigenous people, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. Obama\\u2019s letter on Monday supported Unite Against Book Bans, a campaign led by the American Library Association (ALA). Obama also appeared in a TikTok video posted by the Kankakee Public Library, from Illinois, which has found success with viral videos. The 44th president appeared at the end of the short video, which otherwise featured staff reading books subject to bans or attempted bans. Obama was shown reading and sipping from a library-branded mug. More videos are set to be released. The ALA has found that in US public schools last year, \\u201ca record 2,571 unique titles were targeted for censorship\\u201d, often by parent-led groups, \\u201ca 38% increase from the 1,858 unique titles targeted for censorship in 2021\\u201d. \\u201cOf those titles, the vast majority were written by or about members of the LGBTQ+ community and people of colour,\\u201d it adds.\\n\\n\\n\\n17 Jul 2023 18.03 EDT House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Republicans will move forward with a scheduled hearing featuring Robert Kennedy Jr after the Democratic presidential hopeful was condemned for falsely claiming that Covid-19 was engineered to target some ethnic groups and spare others. \\u201cI disagree with everything he said,\\u201d McCarthy told reporters.

Polk County District Court Judge Joseph Seidlin ruled that a lawsuit by abortion providers is likely to succeed, and the temporary injunction will remain in place for the duration of the lawsuit. The move restores access to abortion in Iowa for up to 20 weeks of pregnancy while the courts assess the new law\\u2019s constitutionality. Last week, Iowa lawmakers passed a six-week ban on abortion in a rare special legislative session, called by Governor Reynolds, who signed the bill on Friday afternoon. The law would ban almost all abortions once cardiac activity can be detected, which is usually six weeks into a pregnancy and before many women know they are pregnant. Prior to the law, abortion was legal in the state up to 22 weeks of pregnancy.\\n\\n\\n\\n17 Jul 2023 17.29 EDT West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin is speaking at an event hosted by the moderate group No Labels, fueling speculation that he could run on a third-party ticket for the presidency. Manchin has not declared whether he will run, but it\\u2019s difficult to see how his flirtation with No Labels would amount to a serious candidacy, according to a Vox report. It\\u2019s true that many Democrats don\\u2019t want Biden to run again, and many Republicans say the same of Trump, who is the current GOP frontrunner. But while 2024 may shape up to be the rematch no one asked for, third-party candidates don\\u2019t have a successful track record in the US, and there\\u2019s no indication a third-party candidate would be able to launch a credible challenge to either party\\u2019s nominee this time. If Manchin or another third-party candidate runs, they would probably lose badly. They might, however, get enough support among moderates to derail Biden in states that he narrowly won in 2020, despite No Labels co-chair Joe Lieberman\\u2019s assurances that his group is not looking to get in the race for a \\u201cspoiler.\\u201d\\n\\nUpdated at 17.30 EDT\\n\\n17 Jul 2023 17.13 EDT The White House\\u2019s press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, described Robert F Kennedy\\u2019s comments that Covid-19 was \\u201cethnically targeted\\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people as false\\u201d and \\u201cvile\\u201d. \\u201cThe claims made on that tape is false,\\u201d she said during a press briefing earlier this afternoon.

Nor does he have anything to say about the 45th president\\u2019s relationship with the Russian dictator or his tropism toward despots in general.\\n\\nAs is to be expected, not everyone on Trump\\u2019s team was enamored with Lighthizer. In his own book, Taking Back Trump\\u2019s America, Navarro scolded him for refusing to appear on TV in the run-up to the 2020 election. The \\u201cGreta Garbo of the West Wing\\u201d, to quote Navarro, Lighthizer possessed savvy and presence \\u2013 and refused to engage when the election hung in the balance.\\n\\nBack in the day, as a member of the Reagan administration, Lighthizer helped negotiate \\u201cvoluntary restraints\\u201d on imports of Japanese cars and steel. The experience provided valuable knowledge of the trade playbook. After his stint in the executive branch, Lighthizer returned to Bob Dole\\u2019s orbit as treasurer to the Kansas Republican\\u2019s 1996 presidential campaign. The pair had backed the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), enacted in 1994, when Bill Clinton sat in the White House.\\n\\nOver time, however, Lighthizer became a Nafta critic. He now writes that Ross Perot got it right when he warned of a middle-class job exodus if the agreement became law, of a \\u201cgreat sucking sound\\u201d, indeed. Along with the Iraq war and the opioid crisis, the downside of the free trade deal with Canada and Mexico helped drive lunch-bucket voters into Trump\\u2019s arms and transform the Democrats into an upstairs-downstairs coalition.\\n\\nNafta \\u201cis no longer an acronym \\u2013 it\\u2019s a noun and a profanity\\u201d, Salena Zito and Brad Todd caught an interviewee saying in The Great Revolt, their 2018 book about the forces that helped empower Trump.\\n\\nAs a lawyer in private practice, Lighthizer represented the US steel industry. As Trump\\u2019s trade representative, he negotiated the United States\\u2013Mexico\\u2013Canada Agreement, aka the USMCA, to replace Nafta. He also clashed and negotiated with China.\\n\\nHe now castigates the Biden administration for being insufficiently tough with Beijing, but observes that Trump\\u2019s tariffs against China have been maintained. Lighthizer calls Katherine Tai, his successor as US trade representative, \\u201cestimable\\u201d, lauding her efforts to protect American industry. He also has kind words for Nancy Pelosi and Richard Neal, Democrats now former House speaker and former chair of the tax and trade committee. Lighthizer was once chief of staff to the Senate finance committee. He maintains respect for Capitol Hill.\\n\\nHe testified there recently, about the danger posed by China.\\n\\n\\u201cI believe that China is the most dangerous threat that we face as a nation,\\u201d he told a House select committee. \\u201cIndeed, it may be the most perilous adversary we\\u2019ve ever had.\\u201d\\n\\nWhatever the danger posed by China, Lighthizer has indirectly invested there himself. His 2019 and 2020 executive branch personnel public financial disclosures show ownership of between $2m and $10m in the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund. Tencent, the Chinese technology and entertainment conglomerate, is one of the fund\\u2019s largest holdings.\\n\\nIrony abounds. In August 2020, Trump issued an executive order to \\u201caddress the threat posed by WeChat\\u201d, seeking for it to be banned. WeChat is \\u201ca messaging, social media and electronic payment application\\u201d owned by \\u2026 Tencent.\\n\\nPredictably, Lighthizer trashes \\u201cglobalists\\u201d, the Koch-funded Cato Institute and other ideological free-traders. He takes aim at Larry Summers, a veteran of the Clinton and Obama administrations and former president of Harvard. Summers called for tariff cuts to reduce the sting of inflation. Lighthizer calls him \\u201cChina\\u2019s favorite former treasury secretary\\u201d.\\n\\nLighthizer neglects to examine how free trade became a Republican orthodoxy \\u2013 until it wasn\\u2019t. In 1962, Milton Friedman, of the University of Chicago, wrote in Capitalism and Freedom, his best-known work, that the US should scrap tariffs.\\n\\n\\u201cIt would be far better for us to move to free trade unilaterally, as Britain did in the 19th century when it repealed the Corn Laws,\\u201d Friedman urged. \\u201cWe are a great nation, and it ill behooves us to require reciprocal benefits from China, Mexico or Europe before we reduce a tariff on products from those countries.\\u201d\\n\\nIn August 1980, Friedman repeated that call. A decade later, George HW Bush did the heavy lifting on Nafta. More Republicans than Democrats backed that agreement.\\n\\nIn Lighthizer\\u2019s eyes, Friedman fairs better than Summers. Lighthizer takes issue with the Nobel-winner\\u2019s take on floating exchange rates but ignores his legacy on trade. Likewise, he goes easy on Bush.\\n\\nBeyond all that, No Trade Is Free is an accessible and readable chronicle of US trade history and policy over the past half-century.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Rich Tenorio\", \"title\": \"Filthy Rich Politicians: journalist Matt K Lewis on Trump, ethics and money in Washington\", \"description\": \"New books discusses \\u2018disturbing\\u2019 discoveries about how politicos enrich themselves, from stocks to lobbying and book dealsWhen Covid-19 materialized as a serious threat, Richard Burr took action.

Lewis confessed he did not, asked his colleagues if they did, and saw a sea of hands.\\n\\n\\u201cFor me, it really hit home that I wasn\\u2019t in Kansas any more, so to speak,\\u201d he recalls.\\n\\nLewis planned his book as a survey of America\\u2019s 100 richest politicians. It evolved into a more substantive project, although the original idea is reflected by two lists in the appendix: the 25 wealthiest members of Congress and the 10 richest presidents.\\n\\nThe Florida Republican senator Rick Scott \\u2013 who before entering politics ran a company fined $1.7bn for Medicare fraud \\u2013 leads the congressional list with more than $200m. Top of the presidential list is Donald Trump, whose net worth topped out at $3.1bn.\\n\\n\\u201cPutting money aside, [Trump] changed the game in many ways,\\u201d Lewis says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s never going to be the same, and not primarily because of his wealth \\u2013 he\\u2019s such a different type of human being and president than we\\u2019ve ever seen.\\u201d\\n\\nIronically, Trump\\u2019s populist denunciations of corruption and the DC \\u201cswamp\\u201d resonated strongly with voters.\\n\\nCiting a 2015 Pew Research Center survey, Lewis says: \\u201cThree-quarters of Americans believed politicians were primarily selfish and interested in feathering their own nest. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s any surprise that one year later, Donald Trump was elected. He talked about how the game was rigged, he talked about elites and the establishment and the need to drain the swamp.\\u201d\\n\\nJoe Biden stands on stage with his wife Jill, sons Hunter and Beau and father Joe Biden Sr, at a campaign event in 1988.

Thursday\\u2019s 6 to 3 ruling barring affirmative action at Harvard and the University of North Carolina will affect virtually every selective higher education institution in the US, with potential ramifications far beyond.\\n\\nOn Friday, the last day of the term, the six conservatives wielded their sword over LGBTQ+ rights. In another 6 to 3 ruling, they slashed to the ground anti-discrimination protections to allow a devout Christian web designer to turn away same-sex couples.\\n\\nThe case, 303 Creative v Elenis, was instigated by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a rightwing Christian group that has been classed as an extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Its legal arguments were based on questionable evidence.\\n\\nThe icing on the conservative cake, also delivered on Friday by a 6 to 3 margin, struck down the Biden administration\\u2019s student debt forgiveness plan. Buried with it were the financial hopes of 40 million Americans.\\n\\nThe noise of the last couple of days comes at the end of a judicial term in which, in other respects, the chief justice John Roberts had made notable efforts to keep the court more attuned to rest of the nation. In rulings over voting rights and Native American protections he had steered a middle course, much to the relief of progressives who had been expecting the worst.\\n\\nBut it is the booming decisions on race, LGBTQ+ rights and student debt for which the 2022-23 term will most be remembered. The willingness of the six rightwing justices to stamp their mark on essential spheres of American life, shredding up to half a century of settled law in the process, confirmed the exceptional nature of the current bench.\\n\\nJoe Biden put it pithily: \\u201cThis is not a normal court.\\u201d\\n\\nLia Epperson, a constitutional law professor at American University\\u2019s Washington College of Law, said that a clear pattern was now emerging. \\u201cWe see the court willing to go places it has not gone so quickly in the past, eviscerating precedent and disrupting social norms in ways that are so far reaching.\\u201d\\n\\nThe decision to end race-conscious admissions puts an abrupt halt to 40 years of established practice in both public and private colleges. That is an echo of the Dobbs abortion ruling, in which the conservative supermajority tore up Roe v Wade, which had stood as the law of the land for 50 years.\\n\\nA majority of Americans support Biden\\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan. Photograph: Shutterstock\\n\\nThe court\\u2019s most seismic decisions not only discarded long-held precedent, they also swam against the tide of public opinion. The five men and one woman who compose the Trump-created supermajority \\u2013 unelected and appointed for life \\u2013 are dramatically impacting the lives of millions of Americans in what amounts to minority rule:\\n\\nThe right to an abortion is supported by 61% of Americans;\\n\\nThe court\\u2019s block on Biden\\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan goes against the views of 62%;\\n\\nThe decision to tear down affirmative action flies in the face of 63% of Americans who want the practice to continue;\\n\\nSeventy-one per cent think same-sex marriages should be recognized by law and entitled to the same rights as traditional marriages.\\n\\n\\u201cThe court system has become so independent of American public opinion and desires \\u2013 and certainly our understanding of the constitution \\u2013 that it risks damaging democracy in a significant way,\\u201d said Caroline Fredrickson, a law professor at Georgetown University.\\n\\nSo fierce has been the supermajority\\u2019s assault on American values and norms that it is certain further to embolden calls for a reboot. Anger towards the court is on the rise, and confidence in it at an historic low.\\n\\nThe recent spate of ethics scandals have only aggravated the situation. All three of the conservative hardliners \\u2013 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and the Trump-appointed Neil Gorsuch \\u2013 have fallen foul of ethics disputes.\\n\\nThe trio were exposed as having failed to disclose luxury travel, lavish gifts or financial interactions with billionaires or corporate interests. Uniquely though, they have the ability to turn a blind eye to the accusations \\u2013 supreme court justices are the only judges in the country who are unbound by any ethics code.\\n\\nThe backlash is already gathering speed. Within hours of the affirmative action ruling, Hank Johnson, a Democratic congressman from Georgia, denounced it as the work of \\u201cMaga\\u201d justices, after Trump\\u2019s Make America Great Again slogan.\\n\\nJohnson is sponsoring a bill that would expand the court from nine to 13 justices as a means of loosening the hard right\\u2019s grip on power. \\u201cJudicial activism must be met with passage of my legislation,\\u201d he thundered.\\n\\nCalls to the barricades such as Johnson\\u2019s threaten the reputation and stability of the supreme court. The standing of one justice is especially imperiled: Chief Justice Roberts.\\n\\nThe court\\u2019s shift sharply to the right has led observers to question whether Roberts has ceded leadership to his most extreme peer, Clarence Thomas. \\u201cRoberts has lost control of the supreme court,\\u201d warned the New York Times opinion pages. \\u201cThe Thomas court,\\u201d proclaimed the anti-Trump conservative group, the Lincoln Project.\\n\\nHeadlines like these cannot please Roberts, a lawyer who cares about the public-facing aspect of his job. Roberts cut his judicial teeth in the political realm, as counsel in Ronald Reagan\\u2019s justice department.\\n\\nAs a result of that exposure to the cut and thrust of political life, perhaps, he is sensitive to public opinion and shows a keenness to hold the people\\u2019s trust. Those are sentiments that seem not to perturb his more headstrong colleagues.\\n\\n\\u201cRoberts is more careful in suppressing his viewpoints when he recognizes that they will inflame those who want to reform the court; he plays a long game,\\u201d Fredrickson said. \\u201cThomas and Alito don\\u2019t have that vision \\u2013 they want immediate gratification, whereas the chief is satisfied with delayed gratification.\\u201d\\n\\nThat distinction was on display in three important rulings issued earlier in June. In each, Roberts surprised observers by breaking up the monolithic 6 to 3 hard-right supermajority and forging new alliances.\\n\\nIn Haaland v Brackeen, Roberts forced Thomas and Alito back into the minority by orchestrating a 7 to 2 ruling that preserved the Indian Child Welfare Act. The decision was hailed by Native American groups as an existential victory upon which the survival of tribes depended.\\n\\nTwo major voting rights decisions, both written by Roberts himself, were also met with stupefaction. Progressive groups had been bracing themselves for further blows to democratic norms from a court that appeared hell-bent on undoing the gains of the civil rights movement.\\n\\nYet when they came down, Roberts\\u2019s decisions were surprisingly humble, sticking closely to existing law. In Allen v Milligan, he and another Trump appointee Brett Kavanaugh joined the three liberal justices to find against Alabama in its attempt to draw congressional maps that blatantly discriminated against Black voters.\\n\\nThat ensured the continuation of Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Lyndon Johnson\\u2019s landmark civil rights legislation that brought millions of African Americans into the democratic process. Part of the puzzle of the Milligan ruling was that it went against Roberts\\u2019s own track record: over decades he had expressed an open antagonism towards Section 2 stretching all the way back to the early 1980s.\\n\\nIn the second voting rights case, Moore v Harper, Roberts yet again drew back from the nuclear option, forcing Thomas and Alito into the minority alongside Gorsuch. Had the hardliners prevailed, a crank reading of the constitution known as the \\u201cindependent state legislature theory\\u201d would have given state legislatures virtually untrammeled power over elections free from judicial oversight from state courts.\\n\\nFar-right Republican lawmakers would have been empowered to do their worst, ranging from extreme partisan gerrymandering all the way to a potentially supercharged assault on democracy in the 2024 presidential race that might have made the assault on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 look like a tea party.\\n\\nRoberts assuaged those fears, resoundingly rejecting the theory.\\n\\nThe headline writers duly obliged. \\u201cJohn Roberts has wrested back control of the supreme court,\\u201d Slate magazine pronounced on Tuesday.\\n\\nTwo days later came the storm.\\n\\nThe release of three devastating rulings, blasted out over the two final days of the term, will at least for now silence talk about Roberts\\u2019s moderating influences. This is the chief justice, after all, who personally wrote two of them \\u2013 affirmative action, and the block on student loan forgiveness \\u2013 and who joined the third attacking LGBTQ+ rights.\\n\\nAnalysts point out that it was always a mistake to perceive Roberts as a moderating force or to underestimate the intensity of his conservative ambitions. A quick look back at the landmark rulings of the Roberts court settles that score:\\n\\nCitizens United (2010), which Roberts joined opening the floodgates for corporate cash to enter politics;\\n\\nShelby County (2013), which he wrote punching a giant hole in the Voting Rights Act and prompting a resurgence of voter suppression;\\n\\nObergefell v Hodges (2015), which guaranteed the right to gay marriage and which Roberts opposed, issuing a strongly worded dissent;\\n\\nAnd this week\\u2019s affirmative action and LGBTQ+ rulings (2023), which respectively set back the fight for equal opportunities for minorities in education and opened the door to overt discrimination of protected groups.\\n\\nThat is quite the record.\\n\\n\\u201cI remain very skeptical of chief justice Roberts\\u2019s judicial temperament,\\u201d Fredrickson said. \\u201cHe is driven not by disagreement with his conservative peers, but by a different strategy: how to get to the same ends.\\u201d\\n\\nAs the judicial term draws to a close, that may be the greatest take away: the Roberts court remains very much alive, just don\\u2019t expect it to deliver too many more surprises.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Lois Beckett\", \"title\": \"How a 24-hour drag show predicted the past seven years in America\", \"description\": \"Just before Trump\\u2019s election, Taylor Mac staged a spectacular queer history of the US that was mysteriously prophetic about the culture wars that would followIn 2016, I bought a ticket to a drag show that promised to recap the entire history of American democ\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/30/taylor-mac-24-hour-drag-show\", \"text\": \"In 2016, I bought a ticket to a drag show that promised to recap the entire history of American democracy.

Photograph: Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images for Montclair film festival\\n\\nThis was a lurid, maximalist version of American history, told from the very queer margins. Mac, who uses the gender pronoun judy, after Judy Garland, was exploring the country\\u2019s 240 years of anxiety over gender and sexuality, from the fraught effeminate figure of the 18th-century dandy, lampooned and reclaimed in Yankee Doodle Dandy, to the 1926 vaudeville song decrying the rise of \\u201cmasculine women and feminine men,\\u201d to the grief and terror of the Aids crisis.\\n\\nFor all its excess, this was an intimate performance \\u2013 an attempt to explore, as Mac puts it in a new HBO documentary about the show, \\u201cwhat happens when history is filtered through one body,\\u201d and \\u201cthe idea that a queer body could become a metaphor for America\\u201d.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s almost too appropriate that Mac\\u2019s drag history documentary is being released during a violent Pride month, as the Human Rights Campaign announces a \\u201cstate of emergency\\u201d for LGBTQ+ people in the US, lawmakers have introduced hundreds of bills targeting transgender youth and adults, and multiple states have attempted to ban or restrict drag performances. The 24-Decade History of Popular Music explores the defiant fabulousness of queer Americans as well as their intense vulnerability to shame and violence, and it forces its audience to experience the exhaustion and exhilaration of queer endurance.\\n\\nMac sang and joked and narrated almost nonstop the entire 24 hours, with brief pauses for pee breaks or to chug smoothies, during which the orchestra played on. Each decade, one musician departed the stage, a constant reminder of the losses of the Aids epidemic, and Mac kept singing on, voice fraying to its absolute limits.\\n\\nA New York Times critic called the performance \\u201cone of the great experiences of my life\\u201d; the Guardian said it was \\u201ceverything\\u201d. I have spent the past seven years thinking about it \\u2013 trying to understand what Mac managed to explain about American democracy that I and my fellow news journalists still cannot.\\n\\nBy early October 2016, when I showed up to see Mac\\u2019s spectacle, plenty of people who were not performance artists had already weighed in on the state of American politics. Confronted with Trump, they had come up with buzzwords: economic anxiety, populism, the \\u201calt-right\\u201d. Onscreen at Fox and CNN and NBC, surrogates and outrage peddlers assuaged and contested, and behind them the fact-checkers said: \\u201cTrue\\u201d, \\u201ctrue\\u201d, \\u201cmostly true\\u201d, \\u201cfalse\\u201d, \\u201cpants on fire\\u201d.\\n\\nTaylor Mac in A 24-Decade History of Popular Music. Photograph: HBO\\n\\nThe vast machinery of American politics had predicted that Clinton would win. President Trump would spend the next years gloating: Democrats, the media, all his enemies had been wrong. But Mac, dancing in false eyelashes and glitter, had not been wrong.\\n\\nThe Democratic party had come into the 2016 election with pretty ideas: civility, tolerance: \\u201cThey go low, we go high.\\u201d Then the moral arc of the universe bent right past Obama towards a president who told the Proud Boys to \\u201cstand back and stand by\\u201d and whose supporters stormed the Capitol.\\n\\nMac\\u2019s 24-Decade History of Popular Music was crammed with catchy tunes, but the backstories of these hits were dark. Mac\\u2019s America was not marching in a slow line of dutiful liberal progress. It was struggling in a compulsive spiral of hope and trauma and repression and denial. It was glittering and terrifying; vulnerable and vicious.\\n\\nThis was a country powered by a violent sentimentality that stole its popular culture from the people it enslaved, imprisoned, or refused to recognise as citizens. It was an American dream founded by people who had built their stolen nation with waves of people who had been kidnapped or who had come to this promised land from homes set aflame.\\n\\nMac demanded that we understand all of this. And Mac also made clear, as so many politicians and pundits still do not, that understanding is not the same as forgiveness.\\n\\nMac grew up in Stockton, California, a town the artist recalls as full of depressing tract houses and intense homophobia. There were no gay role models, or even out adults, and the Aids crisis was fueling an intense backlash. In 1986, as Mac tells it, judy\\u2019s first wet dream featured Maggie Smith riding a Pegasus and two men having sex, and Mac spent next day at school worrying, \\u201cI must have given myself Aids.\\u201d\\n\\nThen Mac and a friend finally made it to the Aids walk in San Francisco: \\u201cThe very first time I met an out homosexual, it was thousands all at the same time.\\u201d\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Guide Free weekly newsletter Get our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Friday Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What I experienced was a community of people that were being built as a result of being torn apart.\\u201d\\n\\nThis was the inspiration for what would turn into the 24-Decade History of Popular Music, an attempt, Mac says, to make audiences feel what it is like to try to build community under extreme duress.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s strange to look back now at how this marathon of American song seemed to contain within it all the major news events of the years to come: it narrated explicit white supremacist violence and xenophobia, uprisings against police violence, threats of civil war, tensions with Russia, a devastating epidemic. This was a more accurate vision of what was ahead for the US than most political analysts had provided in 2016. I\\u2019ve kept asking myself: what do artists tell us that CNN can\\u2019t?\\n\\nPart of the answer is simply that Mac\\u2019s drag show took the violence of American history seriously. People lost to war and accident tend to show up in popular songs: when will Johnny come marching home? Mac and music director Matt Ray added songs to this tradition, writing a ballad for the show\\u2019s final decade to honour the people killed in the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando that year. But they also investigated the American songbook, finding passing references to the Trail of Tears in folk songs and twisting apart racist minstrel tunes.\\n\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t applaud it,\\u201d Mac warned the audience as judy finished one of the most gorgeous numbers of the entire show, the lilting sea shanty Coal Black Rose. The rhythm of the sailor\\u2019s physical labor is in the pace of the lines, but, Mac explained, it was also a song about gang-rape \\u2013 about men building community through sexual violence. Midway through the show, and 10 months before Charlottesville, the performers also staged a furious exorcism of a Confederate soldier \\u2013 denying him honour, demanding that he stay dead.\\n\\nIt is also the case that American politics is much more bizarre, theatrical and absurd than most of the tidy news coverage produced about it. Trump himself is, of course, an incredible performance artist, a master of audience participation.\\n\\nPart of what made Mac\\u2019s 24 hour show so accurate was simply that it contained multitudes. There were people knitting on stage as a tribute to American handicrafts. There was a production of the Mikado staged on Mars.\\n\\nThere was the burlesque artist Tigger!, who pantomimed an elaborate striptease while not wearing any clothes at all, the best preparation I can imagine for eight years of watching the jiggle and droop of a president\\u2019s naked ego.\\n\\nMac and judy\\u2019s collaborators had built failure into their marathon performance, arguing that greatness could only be achieved when perfection was physically impossible. Would Mac even be able to sing for the full 24 hours? Nobody knew. But Mac was also arguing for failure on a deeper level, proposing a queer American origin story rooted in grief and struggle. We did not need to wait for a better time, the show suggested. Right here, in the middle of losing everything \\u2013 this is the heart of our country. This is the only place to build.\\n\\nAt around 7am, the sleepiest part of an all-nighter, Mac asked us to take revenge on Ted Nugent by staging a gay prom to Snakeskin Cowboys, a country song about gay bashing.\\n\\nFind someone of the same gender to dance with, Mac commanded us, and I wandered through the crowd. \\u201cThere are so many men in this room,\\u201d another woman told me, as we finally turned towards each other. I had not realised it, but it was true. Then a third woman found us, and we sighed and wound our arms around each other.\\n\\nWe were so impossibly tired by then, but somehow we swayed gently to the music, held each other up. I knew already, in those slow news days of 2016, that history does not stop, but if you are lucky it will ignore you for a little while, and you can hide together, rest in the smell of her shampoo.\\n\\nAt some point in the last of the 24 hours, I stumbled out of the dark cave of song and into the lobby. I was surprised to find it was light again, a gray, dim light, and the world was still there. Rain. The Brooklyn Bridge.

The white nationalist ideology which inspired Payton Gendron to travel 200 miles to massacre 10 people in a Black Buffalo neighborhood is becoming as American as cherry pie.\\n\\nNeiwert shows such extremism has been \\u201cwidely adopted\\u201d from \\u201cthe highest reaches of the Republican party\\u201d to broadcasts by Tucker Carlson, \\u201cthe most popular cable talk show host\\u201d until Fox News fired him.\\n\\nThe surge in rightwing extremism inspired by the election of the US\\u2019s first Black president was reflected in an explosion in militia groups during Barack Obama\\u2019s first year in office. Then came Donald Trump, the first modern president to celebrate white supremacists. He praised \\u201cfine people on both sides\\u201d in Charlottesville, Virginia, where in August 2017 neo-Nazis clashed with counter-protesters, and he embraced the Proud Boys in 2020, telling them to \\u201cstand back and stand by\\u201d.\\n\\nThe collaboration between such a president and the high-speed locomotive of social media has had disastrous consequences. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have brought American wackos together faster than any previous medium.\\n\\nNeiwert is a former senior writer for Daily Kos, the admirable progressive website founded by Markos Moulitsas 21 years ago. But Neiwert\\u2019s work goes back further. When he started out, he saw rightwing extremism as \\u201can excellent bet\\u201d to propel a career in journalism, \\u201can endless wellspring of human misery, social disruption and frightening violence \\u2013 the kind of behavior that always makes news\\u201d.\\n\\nWhen Timothy McVeigh killed 168 by blowing up a truck outside a federal building in Oklahoma City, it became clear to Neiwert that the far right was \\u201can existential threat not just to innocent people in its vicinity, but to democracy itself \\u2026 What was striking \\u2026 was how frequently their rhetoric waded into open sedition.\\u201d What Neiwert has learned over decades is one of the essentials lessons of his book: \\u201cThey never ever give up \\u2026 They are relentless in finding new ways to insinuate their toxic beliefs within the mainstream of American politics.\\u201d\\n\\nNeiwert offers some of the most detailed descriptions I have read of the movement\\u2019s biggest moments, including Charlottesville and the January 6 Capitol attack. His rigorous reporting produces many details new to me, including the fact that when a Swat team evacuated congressmen from a balcony on January 6, the officers drew guns on insurgents \\u201coutside the balcony doors\\u201d and forced them to \\u201clie prone\\u201d as the legislators escaped.\\n\\nAfter Charlottesville, as a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center, Neiwert covered events that advanced the right\\u2019s strategy for \\u201csimultaneously intimidating the general public while generating a phony narrative blaming leftists \\u2026 for the brutality they themselves inflicted\\u201d. Now, he documents how so many far-right conspiracies have made their way into the mainstream, especially the great replacement theory, which says progressives want to flood the country with immigrants, to undermine white citizens.\\n\\nHow successful has this effort been?

His own siblings disagree. His uncle\\u2019s presidency, like his namesake father\\u2019s career and presidential campaign, had an aura of hope and responsibility as well as glamour. RFK Jr talks vaguely of overcoming divisions, but in reality trades upon a peculiar blend of \\u201ccynicism and credulity\\u201d, as one commentator notes. Most recently he claimed that \\u201cCovid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese,\\u201d in comments reported by the New York Post.\\n\\nHowever jarring the remarks \\u2013 he partially backtracked later \\u2013 they sit comfortably with his long history of fomenting conspiracy theories and his nonsensical, anti-scientific views. He has falsely linked childhood immunisations to autism and wifi to cancer and \\u201cleaky brain\\u201d, claimed that HIV does not cause Aids, and suggested that chemicals in drinking water could make children transgender. One of his sisters warned that his latest comments put people\\u2019s lives in danger.\\n\\nSo much for the Kennedy legacy. Nor does he look like much of a Democrat. He is being hyped by billionaires and rightwing broadcasters such as Sean Hannity, and has gained traction among Republicans rather than Democrats. Some see his campaign primarily as a vehicle for his ego and brand, which may be less damaging to President Biden\\u2019s chances than a possible third-party bid by Democratic senator Joe Manchin and Republican former governor Jon Huntsman\\u2019s No Labels group. A poll this month suggested that a \\u201cmoderate, independent third-party candidate\\u201d could gain about 20% of the vote and result in a second term for Donald Trump. But talk up Mr Kennedy enough and he might have a marginal effect in denting President Biden. Others suspect that Mr Kennedy wants the Republican vice-presidential slot. Steve Bannon and Roger Stone have both floated the idea of a Trump-Kennedy ticket.\\n\\nNone of this has prevented him finding up to 20% support among Democrats in polls. Camelot nostalgia and the celebrity factor have clearly played a large part in that. Mr Kennedy has never run for any public office, still less held it, but boasts that he\\u2019s \\u201cbeen around\\u201d politics since he was a little boy. The lack of enthusiasm for the sitting president is also potent: most Democrats do not want him to run again, although they indicate that they would vote for him over Mr Trump. Voters, including independents, are not giving Mr Biden credit for the improving the economy or other achievements. That may not be fair. But it\\u2019s a fact.\\n\\nMr Kennedy\\u2019s appeal goes deeper, however. He has found a home in the world described by a new book, Conspirituality, where new age spirituality and the \\u201cwellness\\u201d industry overlap with the politics of paranoia, as well as alongside the Trumpian right. Distrust of institutions, suspicion at the marriage of state and corporate power, and fear and sadness at the despoliation of the environment are in themselves reasonable concerns. But the political ambition that feeds upon and mutates them into more poisonous beliefs is unpalatable.\\n\\nMr Kennedy\\u2019s anti-vaccine conspiracy-mongering has caused enough damage. His latest remarks show how easily conspiracy theories blur into bigotry and scapegoating.

What do you do?\\n\\nFor most normal people, the answer would be to build your political career gradually. Start small, work your way up, and hope that one day your hard work gets you one of the biggest jobs in the world.\\n\\nBut Kari Lake, a self-described \\u201celection-denying deplorable\\u201d who has helped boost conspiracy theories about Covid vaccines and once called Anthony Fauci an \\u201cevil elf\\u201d, is not like most normal people. Her two-pronged strategy for rising to the top of the political world? 1) Say as many bigoted and outlandish things as possible, in a bid to generate headlines. 2) Become Donald Trump\\u2019s loudest lapdog.\\n\\nFor a while, that strategy seemed to work. A few months ago, Axios reported that Trump was strongly considering picking a woman to be his running mate for the 2024 election, and Lake was one of his top choices. Lake also won a straw poll for the Republican vice-presidential pick during the Conservative Action Political Conference in March. She got 20% of the vote, beating the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley (10%) and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis (14%). Not bad for someone whose biggest political accomplishment is running for governor of Arizona in 2022, losing, then baselessly claiming that the election was rigged.\\n\\nWhat Lake lacks in experience she makes up for in shamelessness. It\\u2019s not clear what \\u2013 if anything \\u2013 the 53-year-old actually believes but she\\u2019s clearly willing to say whatever it takes to get ahead. In 2008, for example, Lake donated to Obama and even reportedly campaigned for him. Now, however, she\\u2019s reviving the racist birther conspiracies about him. She was once friends with one of Phoenix\\u2019s best-known drag queens; now she\\u2019s demonizing drag shows. She\\u2019s an ambitious woman but she also has no problem telling young conservatives that women \\u201caren\\u2019t equal to men\\u201d and \\u201cdon\\u2019t want to be equal to them because we are not the same\\u201d.\\n\\nLake has also positioned herself as Trump\\u2019s biggest cheerleader, proclaiming her devotion to the former president at every opportunity \\u2013 even threatening armed resistance against anyone who went after her idol. She\\u2019s also gone to great lengths to stay as close as possible to the presumed Republican nominee. Last month People reported that Lake essentially moved into Mar-a-Lago and is at Trump\\u2019s resort more than Melania Trump. It\\u2019s not clear whether she\\u2019s having official meetings with Trump or if she\\u2019s just sidling up to him every time he hits the DJ decks (something he apparently does after dinner at the club every weekend) and begging for a key role in his 2024 campaign. \\u201cShe is working the deal,\\u201d sources previously told People about Lake\\u2019s vice-presidential ambitions. \\u201cShe wants something bigger, fast, to compensate for her loss in Arizona.\\u201d\\n\\nAlas, it seems that Lake may have flown just a little too close to the sun. Despite her sycophancy (she once told Piers Morgan that Trump is so powerful he wouldn\\u2019t even need a vice-president), there are reports that Trump has soured on his protege. His newfound objections? Lake likes the limelight too much, apparently. She\\u2019s a \\u201cspotlight hound\\u201d, one Trump adviser complained to the Daily Beast. When Trump thinks you\\u2019re too thirsty for attention, that\\u2019s really saying something.\\n\\nIf Trump really has turned on Lake, is this the end of her career? Unfortunately, I doubt it. Her hopes of being Trump\\u2019s running mate may have hit a snag, but she\\u2019s still got her eyes on a Senate seat. \\u201cShe\\u2019s a shameless, ruthless demagogue who wants power and will do whatever she has to do to get it,\\u201d a Trump adviser complained to the Daily Beast.

The Boris-, Brexit- and Truss-supporting veteran running unironically as \\u201cSafer with Susan\\u201d, or the unknown outsider his supporters are currently depicting as \\u201cmysterious\\u201d, as opposed to opportunistic and clueless? Last week, urged to be realistic about his housebuilding fantasies, Moz complained: \\u201cPeople are obsessed with figures.\\u201d\\n\\nIt might be simplest for the still undecided to toss a coin. What might seem matchless voter-repelling capacity in one merely takes a different form in the other. Both oppose Ulez expansion. As for differences in local knowhow, neither London expert, it emerged, was entirely sure about the population. Was it, Susan, the professional Londoner, hazarded, in answer to Dale, \\u201cbetween nine and 10 million\\u201d? Moz: \\u201cSame, closer to nine.\\u201d The last census made it 8,799, 800.\\n\\nWhat might seem matchless voter-repelling capacity in one merely takes a different form in the other\\n\\nKhan, now understandably unable to conceal a certain complacency about his claim on, at least, a third term (there is no statutory limit), has said he\\u2019d prefer to run against Hall, formerly leader of the Conservatives in the London Assembly. But having watched the candidates, I suspect he\\u2019d do as well, maybe better against Hossain, a successful but oddly evasive barrister whose bid, with little else to recommend it, returns relentlessly to \\u201cmy backstory\\u201d. On the Four Yorkshiremen scale, it admittedly amounts to a comprehensive challenge to Khan\\u2019s luxurious \\u201cson of a bus driver\\u201d narrative. Until 16, in Bangladesh, Hossain had no shoes. NB: Khan had shoes. And now look: a London KC with plenty of shoes (if selected, perhaps he will put a figure on it). Classic Dick Whittington once you\\u2019ve replaced the black cat with property developer and Moz backer Nick Candy, and the Bow bells with campaign staff who \\u2013 like Candy \\u2013 attended the infamous \\u201cmingle and jingle\\u201d lockdown party. Hossain, with an air of long experience in absolution, counsels mercy: \\u201cThey are very remorseful.\\u201d\\n\\nIt was said of David Frost that he rose without trace. Hossain has not so much risen as materialised, for no discernible purpose other than to make Londoners speculate, once again, on what it is about the mayor\\u2019s job that repeatedly attracts wildly unprepossessing or inadequate candidates. The restricted powers with the consolation of limitless self-promotion?\\n\\nIn the first contest, Jeffrey Archer was welcome until an ex-friend exposed his perjury. He was replaced by Steven \\u201cShagger\\u201d Norris. High among Khan\\u2019s appreciated attributes have been that, along with being hated by Donald Trump, he was a blessing after Johnson and a hero compared with Zac Goldsmith. But who, generally speaking, isn\\u2019t?\\n\\nFully acknowledging Khan\\u2019s achievements in air quality and social housing, it remains possible to imagine someone new doing more with the third mayoral term he\\u2019s due to inherit, with tireless help from the Tories, from himself. All the more so, for non-violent Londoners, after Khan failed to condemn misogynistic incitement by a lead speaker who urged a cheering crowd in Westminster: \\u201cIf you see a Terf, punch them in the fucking face.\\u201d Though Khan may yet explain, before the 2024 election, how that exhortation can be reconciled with his admirable \\u201c\\u2018whole society\\u2019 approach to tackling violence against women and girls\\u201d. He recognises, to quote the #Have a Word campaign, that such violence \\u201coften starts with words\\u201d.\\n\\nMaybe it\\u2019s out of respect for party tradition dating from Archer (who had lied about paying Monica Coghlan for sex), thereafter featuring Norris v the \\u201cmonstrous regiment\\u201d and years during which Boris Johnson balanced mayoral duties with his commitments to Jennifer Arcuri (a regrettable disappearance of his emails precludes important learnings from this arrangement) that the Conservatives alighted, in Hall, on a woman whose oracy will never upset their menfolk.\\n\\nIn the event of her selection, of course, this could be less of an electoral plus. Cheerfully, Hall admits she once tweeted that a celebrity was a \\u201cstupid, fat blonde woman\\u201d: \\u201cYes, I am inclined to say what I think.\\u201d \\u201cI nagged like only a female can,\\u201d she remarks of another achievement.\\n\\nThose supporting her know that Trump\\u2019s advice on pussy-grabbing never diminished Hall\\u2019s regard. \\u201cCome on Donald Trump \\u2013 make sure you win and wipe the smile of (sic) this man\\u2019s face,\\u201d she tweeted in 2020 (the \\u201cman\\u201d being Khan). As for Trump\\u2019s Capitol mob: Susan thought remainers who \\u201ccampaigned to overturn democracy and the will of the British people\\u201d were in no position to judge.\\n\\nAny London party members for whom Trumpian loyalty resembles an asset may want to weigh this against Hossain\\u2019s arguably closer connections: his supporter Nick Candy was a happy, post-Capitol visitor to Mar-a-Lago, alongside Nigel Farage.\\n\\nAssuming their party is not, on some unconscious level, in love with Khan, or (at risk of a Springtime for Hitler-style miracle) overdoing a scheme to prevent the creation of a successor-Johnson, what explains Tory satisfaction with such a shortlist? Despair? Fatalism? Reasonable enough, but still careless reputationally, given the many months in which Susan/Moz hilariously presents themself, with a bigger election looming, as what London deserves: the Conservative party\\u2019s best shot at talent.\\n\\nCatherine Bennett is an Observer columnist\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Helen Sullivan and agencies\", \"title\": \"Explainer: What is the Joint Security Area between North and South Korea?\", \"description\": \"A US soldier who has been detained in North Korea reportedly entered the country during a tour of the JSA<ul><li>US soldier detained by North Korea after crossing border during visit to DMZ </li></ul>A US soldier was detained by North Korea on Tuesday after h\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/19/what-is-the-joint-security-area-north-korea-south-korea\", \"text\": \"A US soldier was detained by North Korea on Tuesday after he crossed into the country \\u201cwilfully and without authorisation\\u201d, according to a US official.\\n\\nThe soldier, Private 2nd Class Travis King, crossed the military demarcation line that separates the two countries while on a tour of the Joint Security Area (JSA) between North and South Korea.

Yes, Biden\\u2019s stimulative spending did boost prices. But the big news that\\u2019s not getting through to most Americans is that inflation has been dropping. It has declined significantly from its mid-2022 highs above 9%.\\n\\nConsumer prices are now rising by about 4.9% annually \\u2013 still a problem but not nearly the problem it was.\\n\\nMuch of the remaining inflation is due to outsized corporate profit margins.

On one estimate, it will take another 100 years to fully clear the country.\\n\\nThis is the true cost of cluster munitions. They are not only indiscriminate in showering dozens or hundreds of bomblets over a large area, but also have a lethal legacy because so many fail to explode, only to later be trodden on or picked up \\u2013 often by curious children. For these reasons, more than 120 countries have signed the convention prohibiting their use, production, transfer and stockpiling.\\n\\nThe US, Russia and Ukraine, however, have never been signatories. Russia has used them extensively in Ukraine, including in populated areas where no military personnel or infrastructure were evident. Kyiv has also employed them, more sparingly, but reportedly at the cost of civilian lives in Izium (though it denies they were used there). Now the US will supply more as part of a $800m (\\u00a3625m) military aid package, at Kyiv\\u2019s request. Thankfully, the UK, which has signed the convention, has ruled out following suit. Joe Biden has said he made a \\u201cdifficult decision\\u201d. No doubt. But the president has made the wrong one.\\n\\nUkraine\\u2019s counteroffensive has failed to gain the traction it needs, and supplies of artillery shells are running low. The argument is that, however significant the risks and long-term costs of using cluster bombs, civilians will pay a far higher price where Russian forces prevail. Cluster munitions are effective in combating dug-in ground troops, like the Russian forces along the vast frontline. But the same, of course, could be said for chemical weapons, and the US rightly finished destroying its remaining stockpile of those on Friday. Efficacy is why bans on such arms are needed in the first place. Russia\\u2019s use of them is not a reason to further drag down international norms.\\n\\nUkraine\\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, says it has given written guarantees that it will not use the US-supplied weapons in Russia, nor in urban areas where civilians might be killed or wounded. It will also record their use, to expedite demining when the conflict is over. The US claims its munitions are far safer than those used by Moscow, with dud rates \\u201cnot higher than 2.5%\\u201d versus Russian devices that reportedly fail 30-40% of the time. Experts say test results don\\u2019t reflect real world conditions and that, in any case, the sheer number of submunitions still means a deadly aftermath.\\n\\nInvasion has forced Ukraine to make tough decisions about how to defend itself. The US was nonetheless wrong to meet its request. The decisions of the world\\u2019s most powerful country and military are key to determining global norms. Before Donald Trump took office, it had made some recent steps towards controlling cluster munitions. But it should never have deployed them, including in Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 2000s. It should not have rejected the convention banning them. And it should not be supplying them to Ukraine. Their use will have terrible long-term consequences for civilians there \\u2013 and perhaps, through the example it sets, for civilians elsewhere too.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Victoria Bouloubasis\", \"title\": \"The housing community that will require \\u2018patriots\\u2019 to fly the US flag\", \"description\": \"Developer of North Carolina neighborhood for homeowners 55 and older says his brand \\u2018only the beginning\\u2019 of a \\u2018movement\\u2019The 17 June groundbreaking of a future suburban neighborhood in Gastonia, North Carolina, had all the trappings of a campaign rally.

When Donald Trump kissed and caressed the American flag after a 2020 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), he mouthed the words: \\u201cI love you, baby.\\u201d The gesture landed favorably with his conservative base.\\n\\nWhen asked how this community will define patriotism, Fankhauser responded obliquely that patriotism is a mountain landscape. \\u201cWe\\u2019re in a valley right now, and to the extent that I can have any impact whatsoever on bringing us from a valley towards a peak, it would give me tremendous satisfaction,\\u201d he said via phone.\\n\\nAs for how he plans to identify potential homeowner-patriots for the 1776 community, Fankhauser said: \\u201cThere is no screening process that\\u2019s different than how one would buy a home in any other neighborhood. We\\u2019re only as strong as the pledges that individual homeowners make to one another.\\u201d\\n\\nFankhauser began his career at his father\\u2019s real estate company. He now specializes in low-maintenance housing for seniors, a fast-growing segment of real estate. According to Plante Moran Living Forward, an accounting firm specializing in advising senior living, projections show that age-related units will increase at a 4.7% annual growth rate, doubling senior housing demand from 2020 to 2040.\\n\\nSome of that boom has expanded to include \\u201cactive adult communities\\u201d or others with on-site health care. 1776 Gastonia is part of an even newer type of neighborhood: one where community members presumably share ideals or interests. There are even themed subdivisions like Latitude Margaritaville in Florida and South Carolina for Jimmy Buffet fans.\\n\\nA young girl rode a horse down a newly paved street during the 17 June groundbreaking of a future suburban neighborhood in Gastonia. Photograph: Brent Cline/1776 Gastonia\\n\\nFankhauser says the 1776 brand is a \\u201cmovement\\u201d and the Gastonia project is \\u201conly the beginning\\u201d.\\n\\n\\u201cWe think that commonality and unification is a critical element in patriotism because it brings us to the broadest denominator of being in America,\\u201d Fankhauser told the Guardian. \\u201cWe will shun any attempts to make this a political movement.\\u201d (Fankhauser donated to the Republican party and Donald Trump in 2020 and had previously donated to Republicans in 2003, according to Federal Election Commission records).\\n\\nStill, he\\u2019s got the practiced manner of a politician whose conversations swell with lofty, vague talk about American values. It\\u2019s the kind of nationalist rhetoric common to movers and shakers across the political spectrum. It\\u2019s also the kind of discourse that can be weaponized \\u2013 metaphorically and literally: The real estate company\\u2019s staff show off star-spangled handguns on Instagram, a gift from fans.\\n\\nIn the launch event\\u2019s recap video on the company\\u2019s YouTube channel, men in kilts play bagpipes, and bikers slowly cruise a parade route. Fankhauser delivered a speech that becomes a voiceover to the tune of the national anthem. His remarks end with this signoff: \\u201cGod bless this community, and God bless this great nation.\\u201d\\n\\nFankhauser\\u2019s nonspecific brand leans into what American studies professor Ben Railton refers to as mythic patriotism, which \\u201ccreates and celebrates a mythologized, white supremacist vision of American history and identity\\u201d. Railton, author of Of Thee I Sing: The Contested History of American Patriotism, argues that such thinking led to the January 6 insurrection and the Trump-initiated 1776 Commission that targeted professors and other educators.\\n\\nRailton said this ideology \\u201cvery often has meant agreeing with that white-centered vision\\u201d. And \\u201ca lot of the time, that also defines someone who doesn\\u2019t agree with that vision, who is entirely outside of it and not a part of it. When I was looking at the [1776 Gastonia] website, it\\u2019s this undercurrent of, if one doesn\\u2019t share this perspective, then there\\u2019s not a place for you here.\\u201d\\n\\nReal estate lawyer Harmony Taylor, who is based in nearby Charlotte, agreed that \\u201cthis appears to be a pretty overt political agenda\\u201d. Taylor first learned about the community through an op-ed in the Charlotte Observer.\\n\\n\\u201cIn the United States in 2023, unfortunately, the flying of a flag or the mandating of an exhibition of patriotism in some way seems to have become aligned with a particular [far-right] political movement. And I don\\u2019t think that can be ignored,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nBut is requiring the flag even legal?\\n\\n1776 Gastonia will use a restrictive covenant that includes the flag stipulation. Restrictive covenants, a norm in residential real estate, allow homeowners associations to enforce rules and consistency in planned communities. Fankhauser defines them as a \\u201cpledge of allegiance\\u201d to the United States and \\u201cpromises\\u201d among neighbors. He doesn\\u2019t anticipate that enforcing the flag provision will be an issue and has not included repercussions in the covenant if anyone refuses to fly the flag. The Guardian obtained the 1776 Gastonia covenant via email, but it had not yet been recorded in a Gaston County, North Carolina public database at the time of publication and is therefore not enforceable.\\n\\nHarmony Taylor, the Charlotte real estate lawyer, wrote about the rules governing flags and political signs in HOAs for a legal blog in 2020.\\n\\n\\u201cTypically, restrictive covenants are designed to protect the rights, not impose a speech,\\u201d she said. The Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005 did just that, legislating that condos, co-ops, residential associations or housing management groups could not ban any of their members from flying the US flag within their properties. Under North Carolina state law, the right to fly a United States or state flag in a planned community or condominium is similarly protected, with some exceptions.\\n\\nTaylor believes the 1776 Gastonia rule is the first of its kind in the state, and she\\u2019s curious about its implications for freedom of speech. She added that constitutional free speech protections generally don\\u2019t apply to private actions that curtail speech, such as covenants. But she\\u2019s still uncomfortable with the idea of the development\\u2019s flag mandate.\\n\\n\\u201cI believe there is a strong public policy against requiring someone to espouse a particular political view, and I can\\u2019t help but think that is different from telling someone to simply keep silent,\\u201d said Taylor. \\u201cIn my opinion, there is a real risk that the covenant requiring someone to fly a particular flag would be contrary to the public policy of the state of North Carolina and invalid.\\u201d\\n\\n1776 Gastonia properties go on sale on 10 July, according to spokesperson Casey Kupper. One home site has already been allocated to veterans Peter and Kelly Clark, through the Building Homes for Heroes nonprofit. Peter is a lung and brain cancer survivor with memory issues, and his wife, Kelly, is his caregiver. Speaking from their RV in South Carolina, Kelly said they fit in well in RV parks where seniors often live, but were looking for a forever home. They don\\u2019t consider themselves heroes, applying that term to Fankhauser and the nonprofit instead.\\n\\n\\u201cWithout their generosity, we would be worried about the financial part of it because we can\\u2019t afford a house right now. This is really life-changing. There\\u2019s really no words to describe it,\\u201d Kelly said. The neighborhood\\u2019s patriotism focus was \\u201can amazing bonus\\u201d.\\n\\nFor his part, Fankhauser is gearing up for outreach, with the goal of spreading \\u201ca patriotic flame that lives inside\\u201d of him.\\n\\n\\u201cI do think that I can have some influence on turning up that flame in every individual,\\u201d he said.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Ben Quinn Political correspondent\", \"title\": \"Joe Biden to meet Rishi Sunak at No 10 before Nato summit\", \"description\": \"Meeting partially overshadowed by US president\\u2019s decision to send to Ukraine cluster munitions banned in BritainJoe Biden will meet King Charles for the first time since the coronation in a fleeting visit that will be used by Rishi Sunak and the US president \\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/09/joe-biden-rishi-sunak-meeting-before-nato-summit\", \"text\": \"Joe Biden will meet King Charles for the first time since the coronation, in a fleeting UK visit that will be used by Rishi Sunak and the US president as a \\u201cpre-meeting\\u201d ahead of joint efforts at this week\\u2019s Nato summit.\\n\\nHowever, what will be the sixth meeting between Biden and Sunak since Sunak took office in October has been partly overshadowed by the US president\\u2019s decision to send cluster munitions to Ukraine, weapons that are prohibited by 100 countries including the UK, which currently holds the presidency of a convention banning them.\\n\\nSunak \\u2013 who said in careful comments on Saturday that Britain \\u201cdiscouraged\\u201d the use of cluster munitions \\u2013 has a choice about how much to make of the difference when Biden visits Downing Street on Monday morning, but it is likely to be limited as the prime minister seeks to continue the process of repairing UK-US ties frayed over the course of the Donald Trump presidency and the Boris Johnson and Liz Truss premierships.\\n\\nBiden said on Sunday that providing the weapons had been a very difficult decision for him and, without naming the UK, added he had discussed it with allies.

Pritzker, a billionaire and self-described \\u201ccheugy dad\\u201d, clearly knows a thing or two about successful commencement speeches: his talk has gone viral. While the 20-minute speech, which was organized around quotes from characters in The Office series, wasn\\u2019t entirely about idiot-spotting, that section of it seemed to resonate the most.\\n\\nYou can see why. We live in a golden age of grifters, bullshitters and scammers. We live in an age where some of the world\\u2019s most powerful people threw millions of dollars at Elizabeth Holmes, without doing proper due diligence, because she came from the right background and sounded like she knew what she was talking about. A fantasist like George Santos managed to successfully fib his way into government. And Marjorie Taylor Greene has a seat in US Congress despite routinely going on unhinged rants about, inter alia, the \\u201cgazpacho police\\u201d. Clearly not enough people have functioning idiot detection systems.\\n\\nSo how do you spot an idiot? Well, says Pritzker, it\\u2019s not always easy. \\u201cI wish there was a foolproof way to spot idiots, but counterintuitively, some idiots are very smart. They can dazzle you with words and misdirection. They can get promoted above you at work,\\u201d Pritzker said. \\u201cThey can even get elected president.\\u201d\\n\\nThat said, there are some major signs to watch out for. The best way to spot an idiot is to \\u201clook for the person who is cruel\\u201d, Pritzker says. \\u201cWhen someone\\u2019s path through this world is marked with acts of cruelty, they have failed the first test of an advanced society. They never forced their animal brain to evolve past its first instinct \\u2026 Over my many years in politics and business, I have found one thing to be universally true \\u2013 the kindest person in the room is often the smartest.\\u201d\\n\\nThat is very good advice. But it\\u2019s a shame, I think, that Pritzker didn\\u2019t elaborate further. I think we could all do with a bit more of a comprehensive guide, don\\u2019t you? So I\\u2019ve helpfully put together the beginnings of one. Behold, five golden rules for spotting an idiot.\\n\\n1. Beware of anyone who describes themselves as a \\u201cproud non-reader of books\\u201d\\n\\nIf someone boasts about being too smart for books, it\\u2019s a tell-tale sign they\\u2019re an idiot. Exhibit one: Kanye West, who now goes by Ye. \\u201cI am not a fan of books,\\u201d the rapper told an interviewer in 2009 as he did the press tour for his own book. (Well, calling it a book is a stretch: it was a 52-page collection of his thoughts called Thank You and You\\u2019re Welcome. Some of the pages were intentionally left blank and others just had a single \\u201cKanye-ism\\u201d on it like: \\u201cI hate the word hate!\\u201d or \\u201cGet used to being used.\\u201d) The problem with books, Ye went on, is that they\\u2019re generally too wordy. \\u201cI am a proud non-reader of books,\\u201d he added. Which goes a long way to explaining Ye\\u2019s recent descent into an antisemitic and white-nationalist rabbit hole.\\n\\n2. Similarly, avoid anyone who thinks that every book should have been a six-paragraph blog post\\n\\nSadly, Ye is far from alone in having a proud disdain for books. Over the past decade, the world has worshipped at the altar of Stem. We\\u2019ve fetishized data and technology and devalued the humanities. The result is a generation of policymakers and tech bros who think that books are useless and everything can be understood through a purely technical lens.\\n\\nTake Sam Bankman-Fried, for example. Last year, back when the disgraced FTX founder was still being feted as a genius, SBF told the journalist Adam Fisher that he thought books were a massive waste of time. \\u201cI would never read a book,\\u201d SBF proclaimed. \\u201cI\\u2019m very skeptical of books. I don\\u2019t want to say no book is ever worth reading, but I actually do believe something pretty close to that. I think, if you wrote a book, you fucked up, and it should have been a six-paragraph blog post.\\u201d\\n\\nBankman-Fried, who is being investigated for allegedly misappropriating billions of dollars in customer funds, certainly knows a lot about fucking up.\\n\\n3. Remember that wealth isn\\u2019t directly linked to intelligence\\n\\nAfter Bankman-Fried told Fisher that books are for losers, the journalist had an on-page existential crisis about it. Why would someone ostensibly so smart say something clearly so stupid? After agonizing about it for a while, Fisher decided that \\u201csince SBF is obviously a genius, I should simply assume that, compared with me, SBF will always be playing at level N+1\\u201d. Just because Bankman-Fried was massively rich and successful, Fisher decided that everything he said must have some sort of elevated logic behind it, even if it sounded demented.\\n\\nPeople assumed the same about Trump for a while: remember all the comments about how the former president must be playing \\u201c4D chess?\\u201d A lot of people had a hard time believing that someone so powerful could be so \\u2026 idiotic. Instead, they convinced themselves he must be some sort of strategic genius. Turns out, no, he wasn\\u2019t.\\n\\n4. Dropping \\u201cAI\\u201d or \\u201cChatGPT\\u201d into every second sentence is a major idiot red flag\\n\\nThe same people who wouldn\\u2019t shut up about the metaverse a few months ago \\u2013 despite being unable to succinctly define the metaverse \\u2013 now won\\u2019t shut up about AI. Have you heard? AI is going to be a total gamechanger that\\u2019s going to disrupt everything and create a new normal. Honestly, if you took buzzwords away from these people they would have nothing left to say.\\n\\n5. Keep a wide berth from people who obsess about their IQs\\n\\n\\u201cPeople who boast about their IQ are losers,\\u201d Stephen Hawking once told the New York Times. See, for example, Donald Trump. The only thing Trump seems to love more than making creepy comments about his daughter Ivanka is boasting about how high his IQ is. He\\u2019s referenced his IQ at least 22 times but the most memorable instance might be when he tweeted: \\u201cSorry losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest \\u2013 and you all know it! Please don\\u2019t feel so stupid or insecure, it\\u2019s not your fault.\\u201d\\n\\nAn IQ score is a flawed measurement of intelligence \\u2013 but boasting about one is a failsafe way to show people you\\u2019re a dimwit.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Dana Liebelson\", \"title\": \"How Texas Republicans are catering to election deniers in this county\", \"description\": \"Heider Garcia, Tarrant county\\u2019s elections administrator, quit after an election crimes taskforce was set up, which critics say undermines confidenceOn 22 November 2020, Heider Garcia, the elections administrator for Tarrant county, Texas, was awake in his liv\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/18/texas-tarrant-county-elections-taskforce\", \"text\": \"On 22 November 2020, Heider Garcia, the elections administrator for Tarrant county, Texas, was awake in his living room until around 3am, unable to sleep over fears that a stranger might show up at his house, he recalled.\\n\\nAn account had posted his family\\u2019s home address on Twitter during weeks of false conspiracy theories and death threats about his role in the 2020 election.

He has fanned doubts about voting methods and echoed allegations that his opponent, the county\\u2019s former Democratic party chair, led \\u201ca sophisticated vote-harvesting operation\\u201d. She called the allegations \\u201clibelous\\u201d, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\\n\\nO\\u2019Hare did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nIn February, after the election, O\\u2019Hare, the county sheriff, Bill Waybourn, and the district attorney, Phil Sorrells, also elected Republicans, announced the taskforce focused on election fraud.\\n\\nThe county already had a way to submit election complaints through the secretary of state\\u2019s office, but Republicans said the taskforce would give people a central place to file complaints and bolster confidence in elections.\\n\\nThe taskforce began printing a non-emergency number for the sheriff\\u2019s office on voting receipts, as recently as the June runoff election.\\n\\nThe Tarrant county commissioner, Alisa Simmons, a Democrat, said she fielded a few calls about the phone number. \\u201cPeople were confused by it and uncomfortable with it,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nThey wanted to look like they were doing something about elections integrity Kat Cano\\n\\nThe taskforce is \\u201ca publicity stunt\\u201d, said Kat Cano, who previously served as the alternate judge of the ballot board and central counting station, and the Democratic member of the public testing board, which together conduct elections oversight.\\n\\n\\u201cThey wanted to look like they were doing something about elections integrity,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nJulie McCarty, CEO of the True Texas Project, which boosted false claims about the 2020 election and has ties to O\\u2019Hare, questioned why Democrats were so concerned about the unit. \\u201cI can only assume it\\u2019s because it thwarts their plans to cheat,\\u201d she wrote in an email.\\n\\nAs of the 6 May election, the sheriff\\u2019s office had received seven complaints in the days before the election, ranging from rude poll workers to a candidate being too close to a polling station entrance; all were closed with no criminal activity found, a spokesperson wrote in an email. The DA\\u2019s office has two incidents under investigation and no cases filed, according to their spokesperson.\\n\\n\\u201cThe taskforce is working as designed,\\u201d Sorrells wrote in an email. \\u201cLegal and fair elections encourage more people to vote because they know their vote counts.\\u201d\\n\\nIn other states, Republicans have announced election integrity units in a climate where Trump has sought to undermine elections for his own benefit, despite the lack of evidence that voter fraud is a serious issue. Many have little to show for their efforts, or, as is the case in Florida, are prosecuting people with felony convictions who mistakenly thought they could vote.\\n\\nCriminalizing and investigating voting has long been used as a tool of intimidation, voting rights experts say, especially of voters of color. Crystal Mason, a Black woman, was sentenced in Tarrant county to five years in prison for mistakenly casting a provisional ballot in 2016 when she was on federal supervised release.\\n\\nThe taskforce\\u2019s orbit is also broader than voters. Democrats say the 2021 election restrictions in Texas already made it more difficult to recruit election workers, who are nervous about making a mistake, and the taskforce heightens that concern.\\n\\nIn May, someone posted an anonymous YouTube video of Cano from 2022, doing what she called \\u201cnormal work\\u201d with the ballot board, but insinuating that she was manipulating ballots. (In the video, a sheriff\\u2019s deputy appears to almost always be in the room.)\\n\\nWith the atmosphere around the taskforce, she said, \\u201cany kind of accusation then becomes a sort of exercise in paranoia\\u201d.\\n\\nShe didn\\u2019t know if she was actually reported. But the fear, along with concerns about public perception, contributed to her decision to resign at the time, she said. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t know whether they were going to try to make an example of me the way they made an example out of Crystal Mason.\\u201d\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Start the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day\\u2019s must-reads from across the Guardian Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And it\\u2019s not just voters they are concerned about: more than half were somewhat or very worried about political leaders interfering with how they do their jobs in the future. As recently as June, an elections director in Arizona resigned, citing attacks from Republican officials.\\n\\nIn Tarrant county, Democratic officials highlighted both Garcia\\u2019s resignation and the taskforce in their May letter requesting an investigation from the justice department. \\u201cO\\u2019Hare has consistently challenged Mr Garcia\\u2019s efforts to uphold the integrity and racial fairness of our elections,\\u201d they wrote.\\n\\nO\\u2019Hare responded to their letter in a statement that did not mention Garcia. \\u201cLet me be clear: this \\u2018letter\\u2019 is a political document. It alleges no actual wrongdoing or facts,\\u201d he wrote.\\n\\n\\u2018Strange times\\u2019\\n\\nO\\u2019Hare was part of the commission picking Garcia\\u2019s replacement. One candidate who advanced was Karen Wiseman, a Republican poll watcher who hand-delivered a letter to a lawful voter questioning their address during the fall 2022 election according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and challenged a contract renewal for instrumental elections software that was needed for the June runoff.\\n\\nGarcia told Votebeat in a text message that he wasn\\u2019t surprised to see a partisan candidate in the mix. There is \\u201can expectation that the [elections administrator] will play politics\\u201d, he said. (Wiseman did not respond to requests for comment.)\\n\\nThe vast majority of elections officials treat their jobs as non-partisan, according to elections experts. Some people, however, view \\u201cthese positions not [as] umpires, but as players\\u201d, said Lawrence Norden, senior director of the Brennan Center\\u2019s elections and government program.\\n\\n\\u201cThey have some role to play, not in just following the rules, but in helping to determine the outcome.\\u201d\\n\\nIt\\u2019s still a \\u201ctiny minority\\u201d, he emphasized. But some of the problems he has seen range from giving improper access to election equipment to refusing to certify elections.\\n\\nUltimately, in Tarrant county, another candidate, Clinton Ludwig, who was chosen for the job, definitively said \\u201cno\\u201d when asked if he had any reason to doubt the results of the 2020 election, according to Allison Campolo, the departing Tarrant county Democratic party chair who was on the hiring commission.\\n\\nO\\u2019Hare picked people who were \\u201cto me, very highly partisan\\u201d, she said, though she ultimately felt the hiring process was fair.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think he\\u2019s a partisan individual,\\u201d she said of Ludwig.\\n\\nSimmons, the Democratic commissioner, expressed concern that Ludwig has no experience in elections administration. \\u201cEverybody should be concerned about that,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nLudwig declined to comment in an email, noting he hadn\\u2019t started his job yet. But in a statement, he pointed to his 20 years of experience in the Marine Corps. \\u201cYou can trust that I will further Tarrant county\\u2019s legacy of conducting free and fair elections,\\u201d he wrote.\\n\\nCampolo and O\\u2019Hare both praised Ludwig.\\n\\nBut the taskforce \\u2013 and the environment around it \\u2013 only adds to \\u201chow difficult it is to do an election administrator\\u2019s job\\u201d, Campolo said.\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re in strange times,\\u201d Garcia said.\\n\\nSam Levine contributed reporting\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Rafael Behr\", \"title\": \"The Other Pandemic by James Ball review: QAnon as post-truth pathogen\", \"description\": \"An insightful book about the conspiracy movement compares it persuasively to a self-replicating diseaseMost people made aware of a plot to kidnap and murder children on an industrial scale would want to do something about it.

It is hardly surprising that Edgar Maddison Welch, learning of such a wicked scheme, and outraged that law enforcement agencies were doing nothing, took matters into his own hands.\\n\\nOn 4 December 2016, Welch brought an assault rifle and handgun down to Comet Ping Pong, a pizzeria in Washington DC, to liberate the children held captive there in the basement. But he found no children and no basement.\\n\\nThat setback didn\\u2019t put a stop to \\u201cPizzagate\\u201d, a deranged fantasy among online sleuths who had identified Comet Ping Pong as the hub for a satanic paedophile ring based around Hillary Clinton\\u2019s presidential election campaign. As with so many conspiracy theories, the absence of supporting evidence could be folded back into the original narrative as proof of a cover-up.\\n\\nThat self-replicating mechanism is deftly unpacked by James Ball in The Other Pandemic: How QAnon Contaminated the World. It is a disturbing study of the origins and resilience of an exceptionally versatile and pernicious network of paranoid digital malcontents.\\n\\nPizzagate is just one subplot in the sprawling edifice of QAnon belief. Adherents are lured into the faith down any number of channels \\u2013 Donald Trump fandom; vaccine hesitancy; self-pitying adolescent video-gamer virginity recast as militant misogyny. Followers are then radicalised by cultish solidarity, the thrill of belonging to a crusading gang, and by social media algorithms that reinforce prejudice and exclude dissent.\\n\\nIn some respects, QAnon is a rehash of old conspiracy theories, drawing on established tropes from the analogue age: a vast secret world government; antisemitic \\u201cblood libels\\u201d about ritual child murder that date back centuries. But the 21st-century version is also indigenous to the internet, emerging from a roiling soup of nerdy chatrooms, then evolving to thrive across a range of digital ecosystems.\\n\\nBall, a former Guardian journalist, was once an habitu\\u00e9 of 4chan, the platform where the anonymous \\u201cQ\\u201d first posted tantalising clues about an unfolding plot at the apex of power. That experience equips him well for the task of sequencing the movement\\u2019s cultural and social DNA.\\n\\nAs with so many conspiracy theories, the absence of supporting evidence could be folded back into the original narrative as proof of a cover-up\\n\\nHe is especially insightful on the influence of online role-playing games and the cultivated ambiguity around what is meant to be taken seriously and what comes draped in irony. The original trolling ethos was steeped in nihilistic mischief, breaking taboos for the sake of it, transgressing for thrills.\\n\\nThat slippery joking-not-joking idiom made it hard for mainstream politics to get a purchase on QAnon before it found its real-life incarnation in Donald Trump. The full scale of the cult, and the threat it posed to a democratic society, only registered for many people when its digital fingerprints turned up all over the capitol insurrection that tried to thwart Joe Biden\\u2019s inauguration as Trump\\u2019s successor.\\n\\nThe insurgents\\u2019 failure provoked premature forecasts of QAnon\\u2019s demise. Instead, the virus mutated and spread. For Ball, that is not a biological metaphor. He argues from Darwinian principles, via Richard Dawkins\\u2019s original coinage of the word \\u201cmeme\\u201d for a self-replicating unit of cultural evolution, that QAnon is best understood as a literal pathogen.

Should the world\\u2019s major religions, all of which have inspired crazed acts of violence throughout history, also be treated as social diseases?\\n\\nBall can hardly be blamed for swerving that digression when the task of charting one multi-faceted digital cult is complex enough. No less tricky is the question of a remedy. The most common treatments are factchecking and ridicule, which succeed only in driving devotees deeper into social segregation. Old fashioned refutation with evidence can\\u2019t achieve much without wider reform of the digital infrastructure that creates nesting grounds for the malignant info-disease.\\n\\nBesides, mistrust in politics has been debilitating democratic immune systems since before social media incubated this new strain of conspiracy theory.

Since then, tensions between the two countries \\u2013 which rose under Donald Trump and have continued under Joe Biden \\u2013 have sent those trends into reverse.\\n\\nHere the Guardian looks at the cultural effects of the political and economic antagonism between the superpowers.\\n\\nStudy abroad\\n\\nA western education has long been valued by wealthy Chinese people. Figures show the number of Chinese students studying in the US boomed during the Obama administration, rising from 98,235 in the 2008-09 academic year to 350,755 in 2016-17. But rapid increases witnessed under Obama tapered off during Trump\\u2019s stint in the White House. The Covid-19 pandemic led to the first drop in numbers since 2003-04.\\n\\nA similar pattern has been seen in reverse. The number of US students choosing to study abroad in China rose massively in the early 2000s, before peaking in 2012. Since then, student exchanges have fallen \\u2013 with the pandemic leading to a massive drop from 11,639 US students in China in 2018-19 to just 382 in 2020-21.\\n\\nJournalism\\n\\nDuring the past few years journalistic relations between the US and China have reached new lows, with tit-for-tat expulsions and visa changes making life hard for foreign correspondents of both nations.\\n\\nThe Foreign Correspondents\\u2019 Club of China said 56% of foreign bureaux noted delays in receiving J-1 visas for their correspondents in 2022, and that Chinese authorities often used Covid-19 as a pretext to deny foreign journalists access. About 38% of the journalists surveyed had Chinese sources that had been in some way harassed or called in for questioning, up from 25% in 2021.\\n\\nMeanwhile the number of US journalist visas issued to Chinese citizens, including family members, reached record lows in 2021, when just two were issued (non-essential visa services were disrupted by the pandemic). In 2015, a record 1,041 were issued, but numbers have been steadily dwindling since then, as relations between both countries have worsened.\\n\\nIn 2020 the US state department required Chinese media to register as foreign missions and also announced it was cutting the number of journalists allowed to work at US offices of leading Chinese media from 160 to 100. In November 2021, both countries agreed to ease restrictions on journalists, but just 16 were issued in the 2022 fiscal year.\\n\\nFilm and literature\\n\\nThe cooling of US-China relations has even encompassed literature. Figures from the University of Rochester\\u2019s translation database shows the annual number of publications of Chinese fiction and poetry translated and published in the US has steadily declined since 2017.\\n\\nA Guardian analysis of books tagged \\u201cUS\\u201d on the website Douban \\u2013 a Chinese equivalent to IMDb and Goodreads \\u2013 shows a similar pattern in reverse. There were 267 US books on the site published in 2017 \\u2013 which fell to 146 in 2022.\\n\\nThe influence of Hollywood has also faded in China. While Chinese-produced films have never been that popular in the US, Hollywood historically made up a large portion of Chinese box office revenues.\\n\\nIn recent years, that calculation has changed, with domestically produced films making up 85% of the Chinese market in 2022 \\u2013 up from less than 50% a decade earlier.\\n\\nTravel and tourism\\n\\nThe advent of the Covid-19 pandemic caused global travel to collapse \\u2013 and China has had strong restrictions in place longer than any other country. Figures from the I-94 arrivals programme, however, show a dwindling number of Chinese tourists to the US even before the pandemic hit.\\n\\nFigures for the first five months of 2023 \\u2013 after China reopened its borders \\u2013 show that arrivals are creeping up, but remain far lower than pre-pandemic levels. Just 87,600 Chinese nationals arrived in May this year \\u2013 compared with 255,000 in May 2019.\\n\\nThe UN World Tourism Organization publishes separate figures on the number of US tourists to China, which show rising figures up until 2018, when numbers started to drop.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Arwa Mahdawi\", \"title\": \"\\u2018Zuck is a cuck\\u2019?!

Elon Musk, a very stable tech genius, is throwing a temper tantrum over Mark Zuckerberg launching the Twitter rival Threads. You would think a capitalist such as Musk would welcome a little healthy competition, but he doesn\\u2019t seem keen to compete in the business arena. Instead, he has challenged Zuckerberg to a \\u201cliteral dick-measuring contest\\u201d. Musk, who is 52 years old, prefaced that invitation by tweeting: \\u201cZuck is a cuck.\\u201d It\\u2019s not clear whether he had professional help crafting this zinger or if it came to him in a flash of brilliance.\\n\\nHow is Twitter\\u2019s new CEO, Linda Yaccarino, enjoying all this, I wonder? She probably thought she would be stewarding a struggling tech company\\u2019s return to greatness; instead, she is managing a manbaby\\u2019s outbursts. She probably expected she would be leading complex strategy meetings; instead, one imagines, she is being briefed by her underlings about what a cuck is.\\n\\nPerhaps Yaccarino already knows exactly what a cuck is. It hasn\\u2019t escaped notice that the former NBC Universal executive follows a large number of proudly rightwing Twitter accounts including Catturd, whom Rolling Stone once described as \\u201cthe shitposting king of Maga Twitter\\u201d. If you spend any time in the haunts of the online right, you are bound to hear a lot of cucking; it is one of the most beloved insults of angry white men.\\n\\nFor those of you who lead healthy offline lives and are not familiar with the term, cuck is slang for a feeble man with progressive-ish views (anyone to the left of Mussolini) and stems from the word \\u201ccuckold\\u201d, meaning a man whose wife is unfaithful. In 2014, during Gamergate, the antiquated insult was revived on rightwing message boards. (It\\u2019s hard to explain Gamergate to anyone who isn\\u2019t \\u201cextremely online\\u201d, but, in brief, a female gaming journalist broke up with her boyfriend, sparking a furiously misogynistic movement that significantly influenced the rise of the modern right.) In 2016, the word gained even more traction in a Reddit message board called r/The_Donald. Donald Trump staffers started using it; Steve Bannon, for example, once called Jared Kushner a cuck. From there, it infiltrated the mainstream.\\n\\nOver the years, cuck has become a dangerously amorphous term. While it isn\\u2019t inherently a white supremacist word, it has taken on racist and antisemitic connotations. For some people, it\\u2019s a reference to racist fetish pornography. It\\u2019s also, one linguist has argued, a coded way to talk about antisemitic \\u201cgreat replacement\\u201d theories.\\n\\nMeanwhile, for others, it\\u2019s just a silly word to be used in jest. \\u201cWhile it might have once been possible to distinguish out-and-out white supremacists from [so-called] ironic Nazis, now the different groups were learning the same language,\\u201d noted Tim Squirrell, an expert in extremism, in a 2017 article about the evolution of cuck.\\n\\nSay what you will about the far right; they are cunning linguists, alarmingly adept at packaging hateful concepts into silly terms that can be defended as \\u201cjust a joke\\u201d. \\u201cIncels\\u201d, for example, routinely talk about women as \\u201cfemoids\\u201d, a contraction of \\u201cfemale humanoid\\u201d used to signal that these men don\\u2019t consider women to be fully human.\\n\\nMemes also do a lot of heavy lifting: Pepe the frog, a beady-eyed cartoon amphibian, has been co-opted as an \\u201calt-right\\u201d hate mascot.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not just me saying the far right are strategic about how they sanitise hateful language; they have admitted it themselves. In 2017, for example, the style guide for the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer was leaked. \\u201cGenerally, when using racial slurs, it should come across as half-joking,\\u201d it instructed. \\u201cMost people are not comfortable with material that comes across as vitriolic, raging, nonironic hatred. The unindoctrinated should not be able to tell if we are joking or not.\\u201d\\n\\nSo, was Musk joking when he called Zuck a cuck? Or was it something more sinister? I can\\u2019t say for certain.

But I didn\\u2019t know that from reading it, even though I have; I knew that because someone faster, smarter, probably younger, with a better memory (@hayleycampbell), put it on Twitter.\\n\\nSo even though everything I hate is there, so is a lot of what I love. My father never owned a TV, because he said every time you thought you were good at something \\u2013 cooking, repartee, being alive \\u2013 on the telly, there\\u2019d be someone who was better at it than you. I thought that was just an unlovely overhang of a 40s childhood: the whole point of repartee, and indeed cooking and being alive, is that the more people who can do it, the better. Also, I really wanted a TV.\\n\\nQuite soon after Musk\\u2019s purchase of the platform, more of what I hated was there. Donald Trump was readmitted, having been barred to avoid the risk of further incitement of violence after the ambush of the Capitol in 2021 \\u2013 and the sheer brazenness of the free speech justification, the tedium of it, was depressing to witness.\\n\\nBlue ticks were monetised, destroying any trust in verification while generating not much revenue. Some staff walked, some were fired, and the endless pranks of the new owner \\u2013 walking into HQ with a sink, sending a turd emoji as an auto response to journalist enquires \\u2013 were, again, deadening to watch. A rich-enough man can erode workplace rights yet talk about the work ethic of his staff; he can drag the discourse into a mire and have you debating that as an inalienable freedom; he can engage the whole world in having the wrong conversation.\\n\\nAnd at the user level, Twitter was rubbish. Long conversations I wasn\\u2019t interested in, full of anti-trans prejudice and homespun ick about misremembered feminist lore, flooded my timeline. How could this possibly have been curated \\u201cfor me\\u201d, when I blocked all that stuff years ago? Was it just a broad-brush algorithm for the middle-aged, or a more precisely targeted goading?\\n\\nMy direct messages, meanwhile, were full of accounts with pretty avatars touting a scam that was quite novel to me. A young woman who wants to sell you some crypto, but has also just split up with her boyfriend and is drunk: fair play, I\\u2019m glad to know this exists as a genre. I\\u2019d hate to be the person who still thought internet scamming meant pretending to be a prince who just needs to quickly leave a million dollars in your bank account.\\n\\nAs alternatives to Twitter sprang up, the question moved on: Mastodon, the so-called \\u201cfediverse\\u201d, was an early migration option and ticked all the right boxes politically. It can never be bought, is democratically moderated, and (with the caveat that I could probably be using it better) is also nothing like horrible enough. There are more mature faults to find \\u2013 it is more sparsely populated, the timelines are quite repetitive \\u2013 but the main void is of gleeful spite. Despite hating Twitter, there is something compelling about the horror of it all.\\n\\nThreads, Mark Zuckerberg\\u2019s rival network, tied to Instagram, overcame many of those early hurdles just by having more money and being part of an existing platform: almost overnight, it had 100 million users. People with large armies of followers mourned the fact that they would have to start from scratch, but rebuilding didn\\u2019t seem as unrealistic as it did on Mastodon. It was also gratifying to see the new platform work so well, having scooped up so many of Twitter\\u2019s disgruntled employees, and more pleasing still to see Musk\\u2019s half-hearted legal challenge to Zuckerberg on that basis.

Today, in the wake of the passing of the government\\u2019s obscene illegal migration bill, the attention is back where it should be \\u2013 on those who are truly suffering. Yes, poor Nigel Farage and his fight with Coutts, the top, top, people\\u2019s bank, has made the front pages of the Mail and the Telegraph. True, their record in fighting the corner of the downtrodden is not great; but today marked a great stride forward.\\n\\nIt is truly a wretched story. As Oscar Wilde might have observed, you\\u2019d need a heart of stone not to laugh. Farage has for many years had a bank account at Coutts. In this time, despite him not having quite as much money as top, top people are supposed to have, it has humoured him by letting him keep the account; but now Coutts has said that he can\\u2019t any longer \\u2013 and that has really upset Farage.\\n\\nSources told the BBC and others he had fallen below the financial threshold required, and was offered a standard compensatory account at NatWest, which owns Coutts. Farage maintained that his Coutts account had been shut for political reasons, and revealed that nine other lenders wouldn\\u2019t take his money either.\\n\\nAnd because Farage is Farage, he wouldn\\u2019t let it rest. Yesterday, after a subject access request to Coutts, he said, via the Telegraph, that Coutts closed his account because his views \\u201cdo not align\\u201d with their values.\\n\\nHe cites minutes of a meeting of Coutts\\u2019 wealth reputational risk committee last November, which said it \\u201cdid not think continuing to bank NF [Nigel Farage] was compatible with Coutts, given his publicly stated views that were at odds with our position as an inclusive organisation \\u2026 This was not a political decision, but one centred around inclusivity and purpose.\\u201d\\n\\nFarage says the notes claim that he is perceived as \\u201cracist and xenophobic\\u201d: an \\u201cappalling slur\\u201d.\\n\\nAnd there it is. True injustice in plain sight. No wonder Rishi Sunak has tweeted his support. Andrew Griffith, economic secretary to the Treasury, has got involved by writing a letter to the Financial Conduct Authority about the treatment of \\u201cpolitically exposed\\u201d bank customers such as Farage. For what point is there to a government that doesn\\u2019t protect the weakest in society?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s wrong to laugh at the plight of someone who so loves to rub shoulders with the super rich, be it Arron Banks or Donald Trump, being dumped by a bank for top, top people because they think he\\u2019s just a bit, well, grubby.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s wrong to laugh at seeing this champion of capitalism, a former City trader whose father was a stockbroker and brother a broker, laid low by the alleged decision of a super-capitalistic, super-private bank to make a commercial decision to try to limit its customer base to people it might happily admit through the front rather than the rear entrance.\\n\\nWrong again to stand by while a man who always seeks to set such limits on where other people can go and what they can do is excluded from the private bank of his choice. Has no one here read Magna Carta, or watched it on YouTube?\\n\\nWe can\\u2019t be definitive about the racism claim. That\\u2019s often made \\u2013 and it\\u2019s for Farage, his mates and his God to know and to process as they will. Coutts, in its now public internal document, observes that Farage\\u2019s \\u201ccommentary remains within the law regarding hate speech and arguably on the right side of \\u2018glorifying or promoting harmful behaviour\\u2019\\u201d.\\n\\nBut we can agree that surely it\\u2019s wrong to consider his 2014 statement that any \\u201cnormal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door\\u201d and confuse that with any hint of xenophobia.\\n\\nFarage with the infamous pro-Brexit billboard in 2016. Photograph: Phil Toscano/PA\\n\\nSome will point to the infamous \\u201cbreaking point\\u201d anti-migrant poster during the Brexit campaign, with its megaphone untruth of using a photo of migrants crossing the Croatia-Slovenia border in 2015 to raise the fear of a mass invasion of Dover. But xenophobia and that kind of toxic rabble-rousing are different. As to how, that\\u2019s a discussion for another time, but they are. And so it is right that Farage, in time of need, has our support.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s all so sad. The law prevents private entities from shunning customers on grounds of sex, race, disability or gender, and everyone has the right to a bank account. But where is the law protecting rightwing poison hucksters, who\\u2019ve made themselves so objectionable that even hyper capitalists don\\u2019t want to touch them?\\n\\nFarage has his devotees and his show on GB News, but it must hurt when a financial institution that really loves money says \\u201cyour money is no good here\\u201d \\u2013 and really means it. Coutts, meanwhile, surely risks opprobrium. Proper banks launder ill-gotten gains and fight for the stewardship of oligarch cash. Here it is weeding out undesirables.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a world in flux and crisis, but we are not without agency.

Widely seen as the most important such reform in a generation, it developed in direct response to Donald Trump\\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election which came to a violent head in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. Among its many admirable provisions, it prohibits state legislatures from changing how electors can be selected after an election.\\n\\nThen in one of two positive pieces of supreme court news in recent weeks, the court rejected a dangerous effort to allow states to ignore their own state constitutions. Undeterred, that could have radically transformed how federal elections are conducted by giving state legislatures a great deal of power to set rules for federal elections. The court also unexpectedly struck down Alabama\\u2019s racial gerrymandering plan under the Voting Rights Act.\\n\\nI find it oddly encouraging that, according to a recent USA Today/Suffolk University poll, seven in 10 Americans think our democracy is \\u201cimperiled.\\u201d Of course, people define that peril according to their own politics and world views, but is is undoubtedly one reason why election denialists were roundly defeated during last year\\u2019s midterm elections.\\n\\nAs NBC News\\u2019s Adam Edelman put it: \\u201cNearly every single candidate in battleground state races who denied or questioned the results of the 2020 election was defeated for positions that oversee, defend and certify elections \\u2013 a resounding loss for a movement that would have had the power to overturn future contests.\\u201d\\n\\nMost Americans apparently don\\u2019t want extremists running elections and they understand how high the stakes are.\\n\\n\\u201cOur democracy is fortifying itself on many levels,\\u201d Greg Sargent of the Washington Post wrote recently. That happened because citizens and government officials took post-2020 threats seriously.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a good thing that they did, since \\u2013 according to one respected organization, the Virginia-based Center for Systemic Peace \\u2013 the United States in late 2020 no longer could clearly be categorized as a democracy. It had become, for the first time, an \\u201canocracy\\u201d, which shares qualities of both autocracy and democracy. America\\u2019s rating has more recently improved, putting us back, though not safely, in the democracy zone.\\n\\nIn media, the continuing loss of local newspapers \\u2013 in itself, a serious threat to democracy \\u2013 has been offset somewhat as innovation-minded journalists and entrepreneurs have stepped into that void. Witness the growth of digital-first news organizations such as VoteBeat and States Newsroom, and collaborative efforts like Spotlight PA or the partnership between the Texas Tribune and ProPublica.\\n\\nA recent big pricetag for Fox News \\u2013 $787.5m to settle a defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems \\u2013 is another encouraging development. It provided some accountability for the way the cable network knowingly spread election-related lies after the 2020 election; when that settlement was followed by Fox\\u2019s firing the reprehensible Tucker Carlson, it began to look as if legal challenges could do what advertiser boycotts could not.\\n\\nThe various criminal prosecutions and investigations to hold the January 6 insurrectionists accountable are heartening as well. Those potentially include Trump himself \\u2013 in Washington, in Georgia, and according to the latest news, maybe in Arizona, too. To some degree, the democratic guardrails are holding and the rule of law prevailing.\\n\\nAnd while this is hard to quantify, I know of many citizens and advocates who are working hard to protect voting, to support the rights of the disenfranchised. to lessen the blows dealt by the recent court rulings, and to sustain local journalism.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a heavy lift, so we should all lend a hand.\\n\\n\\u201cGet engaged locally,\\u201d urged Yale University\\u2019s Asha Rangappa told me recently when I interviewed the former FBI agent for my podcast, American Crisis: Can Journalism Save Democracy?

Did I want to take the call?\\n\\nThis was roughly a decade ago, but I still remember being momentarily confused. Assassinated in 1968, RFK was long gone, and though we did get some unusual calls in the public editor\\u2019s office, they tended to be from the living.\\n\\nI quickly realized, of course, that the caller was the former New York senator\\u2019s son, an environmental attorney then in his late 50s. And, given his prominence, I took the call, only to endure an unpleasant screed from this anti-vaccine crusader. Once Kennedy had my ear, he spun out his pseudo-scientific theories, mostly about the causal relationship between childhood vaccines and autism. Though these notions had been debunked, he was relentless in wanting the New York Times to give them more credence.\\n\\nMy job as public editor was to represent the readers of the paper and take their complaints seriously, often writing columns about them, but I didn\\u2019t do so in this case. As I recall, I just shook off the conversation and got back to work.\\n\\nThese days, I\\u2019m certainly glad I didn\\u2019t take up his cause. RFK Jr, now 69 and running for president as a Democrat, has proven himself to be even more divorced from reality.\\n\\nThe most recent example came just last week, and it was appalling. At a dinner on New York City\\u2019s Upper East Side, Kennedy (foolishly) thought he was talking off the record and therefore could drop his guard.\\n\\nSo he went full conspiracy theory \\u2013 suggesting that Covid could have been a bioweapon intended to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people while targeting \\u201cCaucasians and Black people\\u201d. The remarks, heard on a widely circulated video published by the New York Post, \\u201cfeeds into Sinophobic and antisemitic tropes\\u201d, an Anti-Defamation League spokesperson told the Washington Post. The director of the Stop Asian Hate Project called them irresponsible and hateful.\\n\\nKennedy has denied any antisemitic sentiment, or even that he intended that the \\u201cethnic effect was deliberately engineered\\u201d. But the recording tells a different tale.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not as if this latest chapter is an aberration. RFK Jr has consistently spread Covid conspiracy theories and even once compared US vaccine mandates \\u2013 unfavorably! \\u2013 to \\u201cHitler\\u2019s Germany\\u201d. (He later apologized for that one.)\\n\\nThe New York Times summed him up in a news story: \\u201cMr Kennedy has made his political career on false conspiracy theories about not just Covid-19 and Covid vaccines but disproved links between common childhood vaccines and autism, mass surveillance and 5G cellular phone technology, ill health effects from wifi, and a \\u2018stolen\\u2019 election in 2004 that gave the presidency back to George W Bush.\\u201d\\n\\nSomehow, though, his presidential campaign has gained traction; although a long shot, he does have significant support among primary voters. (And we\\u2019ve seen what can happen with a supposed long shot, as Donald Trump was considered in 2015.)\\n\\nThe reasons are obvious. His crazy ideas \\u2013 like Trump\\u2019s \\u2013 are catnip for the media. They make news and generate clicks. And social media amplifies him, too. Mark Jacob, a former Chicago Tribune editor, put it bluntly: \\u201cThe bots and trolls love RFK Jr. Because the bots and trolls hate a fact-based humanitarian society.\\u201d\\n\\nAll of this adds immeasurably to his prominence at a time when Democratic voters are looking for an alternative to Joe Biden, who they think is too old to endure a long campaign and a four-year presidency.\\n\\nWhich brings me full circle to that decade-old phone call. I wonder now why I so readily took that call and gave him a half hour that rightfully belonged to the ordinary readers of the New York Times? Not every phone call got patched through to me, any more than I personally answered every one of the 500 or so emails that the public editor\\u2019s office received each week.\\n\\nAnd I know the answer: I did it because of his famous name. When I was growing up in the 60s and 70s in the heavily Catholic steel city of Lackawanna, New York, any Kennedy was revered as something of a secular saint. And although we learned much more skepticism after Teddy Kennedy (RFK Jr\\u2019s uncle) drove a campaign worker to her watery death in 1969, the name still resonated decades later.\\n\\nWith his ugly theories and dangerous denials of reality, RFK Jr long ago sullied the family name. And these days, I would ask my assistant to have him send us an email.

Sorry King Charles, I tried my best.\\n\\nSo what\\u2019s going on? Good question: nobody really knows. But it all started last Saturday when the Sun put out an explosive front-page story claiming that an unnamed but well-known male BBC presenter had been paying a now 20-year-old \\u201cmore than \\u00a335,000 since they were 17 in return for sordid images\\u201d. The British tabloid, which built its brand by featuring topless women on its page 3 for almost 50 years, is not known for being nuanced and restrained. Still, even by the paper\\u2019s own questionable standards, the reporting on this was shocking. The Sun rushed out a story suggesting a serious criminal offence, without seeming to possess much of the underlying evidence to support the allegation.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, after several days of rabid speculation, the presenter at the center of the story was identified by his wife as Huw Edwards in a statement made on his behalf \\u2014a household name in the UK. Edwards, who had been suspended by the BBC, is now apparently in hospital \\u201csuffering from serious mental health issues.\\u201d\\n\\nThe BBC seem to have no idea how to handle this or even what\\u2019s happening; on Wednesday, the BBC\\u2019s Six O\\u2019Clock News reported that its star journalist had resigned and then had to swiftly issue an on-air correction. Meanwhile, officers at Scotland Yard have concluded there is no evidence suggesting criminality and the young person at the centre of the story has issued a statement saying the allegations are \\u201crubbish.\\u201d The Sun is backtracking and trying to blame everyone else for misinterpreting their reporting. The whole thing is a mess.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a mess, but it\\u2019s also a microcosm: the story encapsulates the unique tension in the British media between extreme recklessness and extreme restraint. It\\u2019s no secret that British tabloids lead the world in rashness. They tear their subjects apart and no tactic is too underhand. See, for example, the famous phone-hacking scandal that brought down Rupert Murdoch\\u2019s News of the World 10 years ago. (Murdoch\\u2019s News Corp. also owns the Sun). Or see the 2020 suicide of TV presenter, Caroline Flack, who was viciously ripped apart by tabloids before her death.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not saying the tabloids are always rash. In certain instances, and when it comes to certain people, they demonstrate extreme caution. They may publish every possible bit of gossip about Harry and Meghan, for example, but they are careful about what they say when it comes to rumors about other members of the royal family. That may be because the rumours are complete rubbish or it may be because there is an unspoken agreement in the British media that you don\\u2019t publish things like that about high-ranking royals.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not just in reporting about some royals that you see tabloid restraint at work: the likes of the Sun may stop at nothing to drum up drama, but they\\u2019re not allowed to say everything they\\u2019d like. The reason that Huw Edwards\\u2019s identity was a secret for so long wasn\\u2019t down to caution by the Sun, it was because of the UK\\u2019s rigid media laws.\\n\\nIn the US, you are free to criticize public figures without worrying too much about getting sued out of existence thanks to the Supreme Court\\u2019s 1964 decision in The New York Times v. Sullivan. The landmark ruling limits the extent to which public officials can sue for defamation and even protects newspapers when they print false statements\\u2014so long as no \\u201cactual malice\\u201d is involved. If you\\u2019re a public official who wants to sue for defamation in the US, you bear the burden of proof. By contrast, the UK has libel laws which are a lot friendlier to the person who has been written about. The burden of proof lies with whoever authored the claim.\\n\\nScumbags of various stripes don\\u2019t just have Britain\\u2019s libel laws on their side, they can also weaponize Britain\\u2019s privacy laws to avoid scrutiny. This is particularly true since a landmark privacy ruling by the UK supreme court in February which made it more difficult for the British media to publish information about people subject to criminal investigations. The case centered on a 2016 article by Bloomberg, naming a prominent business executive under investigation by a British regulator. The businessman, known in the legal filings as ZXC, sued Bloomberg, arguing that the media outlet shouldn\\u2019t have disclosed his private information because he hadn\\u2019t yet been charged with anything in the corruption enquiry. He based his argument on expectations of privacy afforded by the European convention on human rights, and the supreme court sided with him.\\n\\nThe result of Bloomberg LP v ZXC? A Britain in which it is a lot harder to speak truth to power. Britain is \\u201cstumbling toward a system in which tabloids can still peek into celebrities\\u2019 bedrooms but serious journalists cannot report on potential wrongdoing at public companies by powerful people,\\u201d John Micklethwait, the editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, said in an op-ed following the ruling. \\u201cThe courts have now presented the powerful with a path to keep their names out of print for years\\u2026This right to privacy is only for those who can afford it; strangely enough, these often tend to be those who have the most to hide.\\u201d\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re an American reading this and are feeling smug about press freedom in the US compared to the UK, then 1) OK, fair. 2) Don\\u2019t get too complacent. Conservatives in the US have long been determined to weaken media protections in the US. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,\\u201d Donald Trump declared in 2016. He promised to change the law \\u201cso when the New York Times writes a hit piece\\u2026we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they\\u2019re totally protected.\\u201d Conservatives haven\\u2019t managed to achieve that yet, but they\\u2019re certainly trying. There are a lot of people in the US who would like to follow the UK\\u2019s example and make the right to privacy a luxury only the rich and powerful can afford.\\n\\nThis article was amended on 18 July 2023 to clarify that, in the Bloomberg case, the businessman\\u2019s argument for misuse of private information was that he had not been charged with anything in the corruption inquiry.

He is the star turn in the new Apple TV+ seven-part airborne hostage thriller, Hijack, from Criminal/ Litvinenko team George Kay and Jim Field Smith. The problem is that Elba\\u2019s character, Sam, is so over-signposted as charismatic and authoritative, it backfires and he becomes one hugely annoying dude.\\n\\nEven before he saunters on to the plane, Sam is seen successfully charming an airport security woman into allowing a late passenger through (\\u201cMiss, how bad can it be?\\u201d), when this would never happen, and for good reason. Once on the fictional Kingdom Airlines commercial flight from Dubai to London, he stops another adult passenger playing a video game loudly (\\u201cPlease\\u201d), giving the unfortunate impression of a jobsworth teacher on a school trip. By the time the hijack starts playing out in real-time, 24-style, and Sam, some kind of alpha business negotiator, starts manipulating the hijackers (led by Neil Maskell), you\\u2019re thinking, but would they listen to him? Would they really?\\n\\nHow to get across that Johnson\\u2019s behaviour is shocking to watching Britons who are already all shocked out?\\n\\nOnce you make peace with the fact that Elba (Stringer Bell! Luther!) is playing a character who\\u2019s about as cool as Alan Partridge with added air miles, Hijack isn\\u2019t a bad ride. Sure, it takes the concept of implausibility to new heights, and (spoiler alert) it\\u2019s all so rigorously bleached of international politics that the motivation for the hijack, once revealed, verges on dull. It\\u2019s also true that passengers are reduced to stereotypes (posh bloke, vicar, squabbling couple), and there\\u2019s a bulky spaghetti tangle of diversions on the ground (including Archie Panjabi in counter-terrorism, and Max Beesley as a detective who\\u2019s also with Sam\\u2019s ex), only some of which feel necessary.\\n\\nStill, the onboard tension and claustrophobia build well, and the pace is cracking. Unlike too many draining, drawn-out streamer thrillers, you don\\u2019t watch it feeling as though your soul is being sucked out at 35,000 feet. Ultimately, Hijack has all the dramatic gravitas of a fidget spinner, but it calls itself a thriller and it is.\\n\\nOn Channel 4, the Dispatches documentary Boris, the Lord & the Russian Spy makes a rookie error right out of the trap. By now, we\\u2019ve all learned the hard way not to refer to Boris Johnson as Boris, which makes the former PM sound like a teddy bear whose only crime is to be too cuddly. Other than that, BTLATRS grapples with the same problem suffered by any serious examination of Johnson: how to get across that his behaviour is shocking to watching Britons who quite understandably are already all shocked out, what with lockdown/Partygate and the rest of the ever-churning ethics tsunami to deal with.\\n\\nThis time, it\\u2019s about Johnson and Russian billionaire and former KGB operative Alexander Lebedev and his son, Evgeny. The Lebedevs became influential after taking control of London\\u2019s Evening Standard and Independent newspapers a decade or so ago, and some questions in the documentary concern Johnson\\u2019s attendance at certain events at the pair\\u2019s residences in Umbria. Elsewhere, it covers how M15 intervened to advise against Johnson putting Evgeny into the House of Lords, and the unsuccessful attempt to get the Queen\\u2019s office to block the younger Lebedev\\u2019s life peerage (it was all forced through by Johnson, who dismissed concerns as anti-Russian xenophobia).\\n\\nEvgeny Lebedev, AKA Lord Lebedev of Hampton and Siberia, takes his seat in the House of Lords, 2020. PRU/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThis is a tight, compelling 50 minutes, involving former government and M15 spokespeople (the point is made that Alexander Lebedev was sanctioned in Canada in 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine). If it sometimes feels a little stiff, you appreciate the legal sensitivities. Still (and I never thought I\\u2019d say this), we don\\u2019t see nearly enough of Johnson in footage, images or anywhere else. With his feet held roasting to yet another self-inflicted fire, for once I would have liked considerably more of him.\\n\\nThe most positive thing to say about labyrinthine crime drama Before We Die (also on Channel 4), based on a Swedish thriller and starting a second five-part series, is that it\\u2019s entertainingly immoderate. It stars Lesley Sharp as DI Hannah Laing and Kazia Pelka as crime family boss Dubravka Mimica, who square up to each other like old-school Martina Cole-esque matriarchs.\\n\\nI say \\u201cmatriarchs\\u201d because their sons are central to their unbridled mutual venom, which fuels the entire saga. While former intelligence officer Billy (Vincent Regan) works with DI Laing, he\\u2019s reduced to the status of emotional support character.

In short, don\\u2019t come to Before We Die for gritty realism, or indeed any form of realism.

The night of three byelections gave just enough of a split decision for all sides to claim victory. And by all sides, I do not mean the three main parties in England that each chalked up a win. No, I am referring to the factions currently slugging it out within Labour over the best route to power at the next general election. For them, these results offered something for everyone.\\n\\nStart with the unexpected Labour failure to capture Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where Sadiq Khan\\u2019s ultra-low emission zone, or Ulez \\u2013 which imposes a tax on drivers of old, polluting cars \\u2013 appears to have provoked enough Tory voters to stay loyal. That will embolden those Labour voices, especially in the trade unions, who warn of a \\u201cgreenlash\\u201d \\u2013 already visible in France, Germany and the Netherlands \\u2013 among working people reluctant to pay the price for action on the environment.\\n\\nThat will give rise to a familiar cry: act on the climate, by all means, but let the cost fall on someone else. The Tories have already spotted the opening, with Jacob Rees-Mogg seeking to brand Labour as the party of \\u201chigh, green taxes\\u201d. (If the Conservatives follow the lead of other rightwing parties and set their face against any policy to tackle the climate crisis, forget the political impact: the victim will be the planet.)\\n\\nStill, the Uxbridge result, like the spectacular win in the deep Tory terrain of Selby and Ainsty, will also be seized on in the wider argument over Labour strategy. The fight is between two groups. One says Labour needs to offer a bold, radical vision that will inspire voters and match the scale of the task now facing a country all but broken by 13 years of Conservative rule. The other says that Labour\\u2019s primary task is to reassure the electorate that the party has changed since it was so roundly rejected in 2019, and that it must do nothing that risks it being deemed too irresponsible to be trusted with office.\\n\\nThe second group, enthusiasts for the leadership of Keir Starmer, points to Selby as proof that the current approach is working. The first group, which includes much of the left, cites Uxbridge as evidence that it\\u2019s not enough. The Starmerites hit back and say that it was precisely a radical policy popular with the left \\u2013 namely Ulez \\u2013 that cost them a seat. And round it goes.\\n\\nWhere you stand on this argument depends on how you view the next election. Will it be a referendum on the merits of Labour \\u2013 or will it be what might be called a revulsion election, comparable to the US presidential contest of 2020, when enough Americans were repelled by Donald Trump to do whatever it took to eject him from office? There are good reasons to suggest that the next British general election will be animated by just that kind of revulsion \\u2013 at the lies of Boris Johnson, the recklessness of Liz Truss and the damage that the Tories have done: to an ailing NHS and a raft of public services, but above all to the economy, mortgage rates and millions of Britons\\u2019 ability to make ends meet.\\n\\n00:41 Keir Mather becomes youngest MP in Commons after Labour\\u2019s historic Selby win \\u2013 video\\n\\nIn this context, the first task of the opposition is to become an acceptable vehicle for that revulsion, to remove all possible obstacles that might stand in the way of voters thinking of crossing over from right to left. Joe Biden pulled that off for the Democrats: he offered none of the charisma or oratorical fire of Barack Obama; he excited almost nobody. But he was inoffensive, leaving a small barrier for any would-be defector to clear.\\n\\nStarmer has clearly effected the same transformation in Labour, and at an exceptional speed and scale. Recall that the Labour defeat in 2019 was the heaviest since 1935; many forecasted that Johnson would be in Downing Street for a decade. Yet less than four years later, Labour has overturned a 20,000 Tory majority in North Yorkshire.\\n\\nThe Liberal Democrat win in Somerton and Frome is part of the same success story. Lib Dems do best when Labour is viewed as sufficiently unscary that voters in previously Conservative seats feel able to turf out a Tory MP. (It was no coincidence that the Lib Dems reached their high-water mark in the era of Tony Blair.) They did not feel that way in 2019, which is why a lot of remain-minded \\u201cblue wall\\u201d constituencies stuck with a Tory party promising to \\u201cget Brexit done\\u201d.\\n\\nBut Starmer does not scare them. The result is the kind of tactical voting on Thursday that saw Lib Dems lend their votes to Labour in the north of England, with Labour supporters returning the favour in the West Country \\u2013 depriving the Tories of two rock-solid seats. It is efficient tactical voting that walloped the Conservatives in May\\u2019s English local elections \\u2013 \\u201cblue wall\\u201d seats for the Lib Dems, \\u201cred wall\\u201d for Labour \\u2013 and which could remove Rishi Sunak from power.\\n\\nAll of which will hearten the leadership as the party gathers in Nottingham for its National Policy Forum this weekend. They will say that it is their efforts to shake off the legacies of the Jeremy Corbyn years that have delivered double-digit opinion poll leads and massive byelection swings to Labour, and that they have been right to strive for fiscal credibility \\u2013 even when that means having to forswear promises the party would dearly love to make, such as a commitment to overturn the Conservatives\\u2019 two-child benefit cap, a policy Labour once called \\u201cheinous\\u201d.\\n\\nThis argument \\u2013 that when faced with a revulsion election, caution and minimalism are the wisest course \\u2013 has plenty to commend it. Voters are more frightened now than they were in 1996, on the eve of New Labour\\u2019s landslide win: the economy is doing worse, and they need more reassurance. The revulsion is more intense now than then, too: Johnson\\u2019s lies outstrip any John Major-era sleaze. And the electorate is more sceptical, even cynical, of big promises. Johnson said Brexit would bring wealth and sunshine, and it hasn\\u2019t; the Tories said they would level up, and they haven\\u2019t.\\n\\nLabour faces a nation that has lost faith in the notion that politics can change anything \\u2013 and, if it wins power, it will not have at its disposal the cash that was around in the late 1990s. For all those reasons, to say nothing of Starmer\\u2019s own personality, it makes sense that, as one senior Labour figure puts it, the party offers \\u201cno Obama visions\\u201d.\\n\\nBut the combination of revulsion and reassurance is not, on its own, sufficient for victory. As Uxbridge shows, one big local issue can be enough to stop the traffic from Tory to Labour. Voters are clearly being pushed away from the Conservatives, but they need to be pulled to Labour too.

The United States forward announced earlier in July that this World Cup, her fourth, will also be her last. She will retire later this year after playing out the National Women\\u2019s Soccer League season with her club, OL Reign.\\n\\nAs with just about everything Rapinoe has done on and off the field in her glittering career, she is going out her way, on her terms.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m just grateful to be able to do it in this way,\\u201d Rapinoe said. \\u201cI understand that it is incredibly rare for athletes of any stature to be able to go out in their own way, on their own terms, at the time that they want, in a way that feels really peaceful and settled for them.\\u201d\\n\\nRegardless of what happens over the next month, as Rapinoe and Co aim to win an unprecedented third consecutive World Cup, the 38-year-old will walk away as one of the all-time greats in a program littered with them.\\n\\nShe may also be the most famous women\\u2019s player in history thanks to her advocacy off the field. Rapinoe is a steadfast fighter for equality and inclusion, which has inspired many and drawn the ire of others.\\n\\nAs teammate Kelley O\\u2019Hara said this week while holding back tears: \\u201cShe\\u2019s one of a kind. There\\u2019s never been one like her, there\\u2019s probably never going to be one close to her.\\u201d\\n\\nRapinoe reached a level of global fame four years ago when, with her unmistakable purple-pink hair, she led the USA\\u2019s campaign at the 2019 World Cup, scoring six goals while winning the Golden Ball as the tournament\\u2019s best player. That tournament marked an explosion of the team\\u2019s fame and Rapinoe\\u2019s celebrity, but the flame had been lit years earlier.\\n\\nIn 2011, with the US trailing Brazil in the 122nd minute of the World Cup quarter-final, Rapinoe hit a desperate cross to the back post that found the head of Abby Wambach for the equalizer. The moment was quintessential, never-say-die USWNT attitude \\u2013 and was later voted the greatest Women\\u2019s World Cup goal of all time. The Americans eventually advanced to the final, where they lost to Japan.\\n\\nEven before that match, without the comfort of having established her place on the team, Rapinoe was a bold personality. After scoring against Colombia in the group stage, she ran to one of the on-field microphones, picked it up and tapped it, and belted out a line from Bruce Springsteen\\u2019s Born in the USA.\\n\\nOne year later, Rapinoe helped the US win a third consecutive Olympic gold medal. Among her feats was an Olimpico \\u2013 a goal straight from a corner kick \\u2013 in the controversial extra-time win over Canada in the semi-final. Rapinoe scored another Olimpico at the Tokyo Games in 2021, a repeat trick which US Soccer believes has never been replicated at that level.\\n\\nIn between, she won the 2015 World Cup and refined her game with the Reign in Seattle. Her style of play was, and is, defined by audacity and ingenuity, from Olimpicos and unlikely free kicks (she surprised France with a near-post effort in the 2019 World Cup quarter-final) to quick throw-ins that produce assists. She is the type of player who will try anything once \\u2026 and nobody will question it.\\n\\nThe 2019 Women\\u2019s World Cup was a defining tournament for Megan Rapinoe. Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nPerhaps more famously, Rapinoe has also left her mark off the field. She is one of the world\\u2019s most famous out gay athletes, and fights fiercely for the LGBTQ+ community. She has also raised issues around race: in 2016, she knelt during the national anthem in solidarity with former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who did the same at the time in protest of social injustices. US Soccer proceeded to drop her from the team and create a rule (which was soon repealed) requiring all players to stand for the national anthem \\u2013 \\u201cWhite people were mad. Whew, were they mad!\\u201d she later wrote in her memoir.\\n\\nThen came 2019, when her life forever changed. With the team already mired in a bitter, high-profile equal-pay lawsuit with their own federation, Rapinoe said in an interview \\u2013 which was held for release until the World Cup \\u2013 \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to the fucking White House.\\u201d She meant if the team won the World Cup, and she said it as a direct shot at then-US president Donald Trump.\\n\\nTrump took to Twitter to say, \\u201cMegan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job!\\u201d. Trump claimed Rapinoe was disrespecting the country, and she became the face of a now polarizing US team that stood for inclusion, against a sizable group of conservatives. The US did win, of course, with Rapinoe striking an arms-extended pose after each of her six goals in the tournament.\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson Free weekly newsletter Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She never took herself too seriously.\\n\\n\\u201cI know that the world sees the Megan Rapinoe that the world sees, but we get to see her up close and personal,\\u201d O\\u2019Hara said. \\u201cObviously, the \\u2018Pinoe\\u2019 that the world sees is an incredible person and human, and that is her also up close and personal. She brings a sense of humor and lightness but [also] intensity and empathy.\\u201d\\n\\nRetirement has been in Rapinoe\\u2019s mind ever since that World Cup triumph in Lyon four years ago. Everything she did was scrutinized and she felt stuck in the hamster wheel of professional sports. Emotionally, spiritually and physically, she was taxed. Ongoing injuries further limited her production and stripped her of her joy in the game.\\n\\nNow, on a team that has been gutted and remodeled over the past 18 months, Rapinoe is part of the supporting cast. She will mostly come off the bench with the expectation that she can change games in the final minutes with that usual flair and audacity, whether it be another pinpoint cross or a perfect free-kick. Starting and starring roles? Those are unlikely, but she is fine with that.\\n\\nShe accepted as much last year when she returned to the team for World Cup qualifying after a hiatus. The team had transitioned to a new generation \\u2013 14 of the 23 players on the US roster this month are at their first World Cup \\u2013 and Sophia Smith and Mallory Swanson had taken over as the clear, in-form starters on the wings of the USA\\u2019s 4-3-3 formation.\\n\\nRapinoe had become a mentor, a player-coach. If that\\u2019s what it takes to win another World Cup, that\\u2019s fine with her.\\n\\n\\u201cRosters are not a compilation just of, go pick the best players and hope for the best,\\u201d Rapinoe said last year upon her return to the team. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about constructing an organism that works together on and off the field, that works not necessarily harmoniously all the time, but that the right pieces fit for certain reasons and for reasons most people don\\u2019t understand.\\u201d\\n\\nThe USA are among the favorites once again, but they are not without considerable questions, driven by injuries (including Swanson) and tactical uncertainty. If they are to win another World Cup, they will do so largely on the backs of a new, emerging generation, from Smith up top to Naomi Girma in defense.\\n\\nRapinoe will not be front and center as she was four years ago. But she\\u2019ll be integral to whatever the team does, rallying the team in huddles and locker rooms and, potentially, making one last game-changing play.\\n\\n\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"David Smith in Sarasota, Florida\", \"title\": \"\\u2018It\\u2019s my Florida too\\u2019: Pulse shooting survivor Brandon Wolf on being Black, gay and the anti-Ron DeSantis\", \"description\": \"Since losing his best friend in the 2018 nightclub attack, Wolf has become an outspoken advocate for gun safety and LGBTQ+ rightsSeven years after surviving the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, and dealing with the guilt of losing his best friend\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/14/brandon-wolf-florida-desantis-lgbtq-gun-safety\", \"text\": \"Seven years after surviving the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, and dealing with the guilt of losing his best friend there, Brandon Wolf is living life to the fullest. He belongs to an energized generation of young Democrats. He is a prominent gun safety and LGBTQ+ civil rights activist and, at just 34, is a newly published author.\\n\\nBut in Governor Ron DeSantis\\u2019s Florida, he does not always feel safe.\\n\\n\\u201cI have not looked over my shoulder this much since the days after Pulse,\\u201d Wolf says via Zoom from a neatly furnished apartment in Orlando. \\u201cIt\\u2019s because you never know if the person who\\u2019s calling you a paedophile in the Twitter mentions is now wandering the aisles of Publix with a gun they learned how to use on YouTube. You never know if the people hopped up on that transphobic hysteria that the governor keeps pumping out are the same ones that are going to show up to an event that you\\u2019re at.\\u201d\\n\\nWolf had sought refuge in Florida 15 years ago when he was done with rural Oregon, the childhood home where he suffered embedded racism and homophobia on a daily basis. As he writes in a recently published memoir, A Place for Us, his biological father, a Black man, abandoned him before learning his name and his mother, who was white, died from cancer when he was a boy. He was then raised by white parents. His siblings, classmates and neighbours were white.\\n\\nThe young Wolf never got \\u201cthe talk\\u201d about how to engage with police as a Black man or the chance to talk openly about his recurring nightmares of burning crosses and mutilated Black bodies hanging from trees. Nor could he publicly come out in Oregon despite the whispers and rumours he\\u2019d shrugged off for years. Among his motivations for writing the book was to reclaim intersectionality from DeSantis and others on the right who seek to hijack it.\\n\\nHe explains: \\u201cI wanted to give a human flavour to what intersectionality actually looks and feels like and what it feels like to experience racism and homophobia at the same time. Growing up in a conservative majority white town was difficult because the same kid who would call me the N-word on one day would call me a homophobic slur on another day and I was constantly navigating the intersections of those two things.\\n\\n\\u201cAt the same time, I was sitting around a dinner table with my family, who was also conservative and white, and there were just moments where we were never going to understand each other.\\n\\n\\u201cAlthough I had a roof over my head, a warm place to lay my head every night, it just didn\\u2019t ever feel like home and that can be isolating for a young person and ultimately that\\u2019s what drove me to move 3,000 miles from home.\\u201d\\n\\nWolf\\u2019s book has been praised for its raw honesty and vulnerability. He describes in harrowing detail surviving a sexual assault that he has never told his family about before (\\u201cThat was probably the hardest story in the book to write\\u201d). He recalls the palpable fear when his car was pulled over by police who falsely accused him of disrespect and ended with a callous epithet: \\u201cFucking faggot.\\u201d\\n\\nBrandon Wolf looks at the photos that are a part of the Pulse memorial in Orlando, Florida, on Sept. 9, 2022. Photograph: Cody Jackson/AP\\n\\nThen there is the Pulse nightclub shooting on 12 June 2016. By chance, Wolf had stepped into the bathroom when the gunman Omar Mateen entered the club and opened fire, killing 49 people in the deadliest attack affecting the LGBTQ+ community in American history.\\n\\nAmong them were Wolf\\u2019s best friend, Drew Leinonen, to whom the book is dedicated, and Leinonen\\u2019s boyfriend, Juan Guerrero. Some of Wolf\\u2019s memories of the event are foggy; others remain vivid, from the painted faces of familiar drag queens on a poster to a clear plastic cup resting on the rim of the sink and containing ice chips and mutilated slices of lime.\\n\\nWhen President Barack Obama came to pay his respects, Wolf lost his composure. He writes: \\u201cI buried my face in the shoulder of his pressed navy suit, blubbering into the soft, brushed fabric. His hug was firm and consoling. His shirt smelled faintly of cologne. Someone joked that he could be my father, and I chuckled, the first time I can remember laughing that week.\\u201d\\n\\nWolf still revisits the Pulse site from time to time. He explains: \\u201cIt comes with so much pain and grief, so many memories. I still do like to go there late at night when no one else is there when it\\u2019s quiet, because it\\u2019s almost as if I can feel like I\\u2019m in the presence of my best friends, if for just a moment.\\u201d\\n\\nAt the end of the day, the stealing of human life weighs less on [politicians\\u2019] scale than access to wealth, power and fame\\n\\nIt was the deadliest US mass shooting by a single gunman until, just over a year later, 60 people perished at a music festival in Las Vegas. There has since been more bloodshed at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, a school in Parkland, Florida, a school in Uvalde, Texas, and other cradles of lost innocence too long to list.\\n\\nWolf says he is unsurprised because it has become all too clear that the current generation of political leaders is uninterested in solving the problem. \\u201cAt the end of the day, the stealing of human life weighs less on their scale than access to wealth, power and fame. The situation is maybe in their mind too hard to solve, too complicated to solve. It comes with too much political cost if they speak out and so they do nothing and it will continue.\\n\\n\\u201cThe number of communities touched by gun violence, the number of people\\u2019s home towns that trend on social media, will escalate until, unfortunately, we get a new generation of leadership who doesn\\u2019t know any different than active shooter drills and their best friends\\u2019 names on concrete walls somewhere etched forever.\\u201d\\n\\nDoes there need to be systemic change? \\u201cI hope that we look back on this day with that same level of disdain for the way in which we allowed those [tobacco] companies and that lobbying industry to have a death grip on our children, because ultimately what tipped the scale in the fight against the tobacco industry was the way in which they were marketing their product to children and it was stealing the lives of young people across the country. You had an uprising.\\u201d\\n\\nWolf introduces Vice-President Kamala Harris during the United Against Hate Summit in the East Room of the White House in September 2022. Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP\\n\\nWolf, who was a national surrogate for Senator Elizabeth Warren\\u2019s presidential campaign in 2019, has been pleasantly surprised by Joe Biden\\u2019s efforts on gun safety and LGBTQ+ rights. But as a resident of Florida, he has witnessed up close a Republican backlash in the form of book bans, attacks on Black people\\u2019s voting rights and a law allowing Floridians to carry concealed guns without a permit.\\n\\nDeSantis\\u2019s efforts to out-Trump Donald Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary are further turning up the heat. In May the NAACP issued a travel advisory for Florida, highlighting hostility toward Black, ethnic and queer communities. Last month DeSantis\\u2019s campaign released an anti-LGBTQ+ video assailing Trump for his past support of gay and transgender people.\\n\\nWolf comments: \\u201cIt is a scary time to be not just LGBTQ but LGBTQ and Black in this state and ultimately that\\u2019s the intent. So many of these laws, so much of the rhetoric is about fear, intimidation, bullying a majority of the population into submission so the minority can impose their values on everyone else.\\n\\nIt is a disgrace to have a governor like Ron DeSantis that makes people look over their shoulders to win political points\\n\\n\\u201cI have to think, as a pretty privileged person to live in downtown Orlando and be a cisgender man in America, if I\\u2019m looking over my shoulder, I know that young people are looking over their shoulders. I know that other Black and brown folks are looking over their shoulders. I know that other queer people are looking over their shoulders.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd quite frankly it is a disgrace to have a governor like Ron DeSantis that makes people look over their shoulders to win political points. It is a disgrace to have someone like that turning his own residents into refugees fleeing to the north-east so they can get access to healthcare, send their kids to a school that\\u2019s going to treat them with respect.\\u201d\\n\\nDeSantis has been clear about his ambition to use Florida as blueprint for the nation. Wolf believes he knows exactly what that would look like. \\u201cThat looks like the US Department of Education banning books about people across the country, not just in Florida, but in New York City, in Los Angeles and in Seattle too.\\n\\n\\u201cIt looks like the US Department of Health and Human Services banning healthcare for trans kids, restricting access to healthcare for trans adults. It looks like trying to ram a near-total abortion ban through Congress so that he can sign it into law. It looks like probably using the US Department of Treasury as a weapon against any business that speaks out in dissent to his policies like he did with Disney.\\n\\n\\u201cIt looks like using the IRS as a tool against the Bud Lights of the world for daring to hire a trans person to put something on their Instagram profile. That is the vision for America that Ron DeSantis has.\\u201d\\n\\nPeople attend the 2nd annual Dunedin Pride Golf Cart Parade in Dunedin, Florida, in June.

He says it is still the same Orlando that he fell in love with \\u2013 but he recognises that this is a different Florida.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m honoured to be in Orlando, which I see as the seat of the resistance to Ron DeSantis\\u2019s rightwing brand of politics.

Moving to a new site would be an enormous risk for users because you would lose your network of friends. The network\\u2019s entire existence, the theory goes, is secured by these barriers to starting afresh at a new outlet.\\n\\nThis was how the Guardian described Myspace in 2007, when the early social network had 150 million global users, a number so large it was considered improbable that they would ever move elsewhere. (In the end Myspace was soon overtaken by Mark Zuckerberg\\u2019s Facebook, Rupert Murdoch lost almost all the money he spent buying the site, and Myspace\\u2019s once-ubiquitous founder Tom Anderson has travelled the world on the profits ever since.)\\n\\nSixteen years later, Elon Musk\\u2019s Twitter is also testing the theory that people remain loyally addicted to their favoured social network until suddenly, one day, they give up and move elsewhere. This weeek Zuckerberg launched Threads, a new platform aimed at winning over people who, in the words of one executive, want somewhere a bit like Twitter that is \\u201csanely run\\u201d.\\n\\nAfter a day using Threads, one thing is pretty clear: it is not Twitter. But Threads has the potential to be something different and powerful: Twitter with fewer rough edges, more corporate sheen, and enough potential to suck the remaining life \\u2013 and advertising revenue \\u2013 out of Musk\\u2019s struggling network.\\n\\nThe biggest difference is that Threads feels substantially less confrontational, less aggressive, and less based around shouting at strangers with different political views than Twitter. The racism, antisemitism, transphobia and general abuse that is prevalent on Twitter is just nowhere near as visible. Zuckerberg told a user on the site that this was a design feature: \\u201cThe goal is to keep it friendly as it expands \\u2026 That\\u2019s one reason why Twitter never succeeded as much as I think it should have, and we want to do it differently.\\u201d\\n\\nThreads has also solved the problem of starting a social network from scratch by borrowing an existing one from Instagram. Any existing Instagram user can sign up and swiftly reconnect their followers on the photo-sharing app, meaning Threads is not plagued by the sense that you\\u2019ve just turned up at a new school without friends. (In a strange benefit of Brexit for British users, EU countries are currently banned from signing up to Threads due to this feature potentially breaching Brussels\\u2019 data rules.)\\n\\nThe flipside is that, at the moment, no one is entirely sure why they are using Threads. Broadly speaking, three groups are dominating the site: users known for posting photos on Instagram that have unexpectedly gained an enormous audience on a text-centric app; social media managers at companies desperate to retain relevance by jumping on the hot new thing; and people fleeing Twitter\\u2019s increasingly toxic environment. All of them have a different idea of what they want from the site. A large chunk of the first day\\u2019s posts consisted of people asking why they had signed up.\\n\\nThreads also lacks the immediacy of Twitter, with the app\\u2019s main news feed currently only featuring an algorithmically generated summary of recent posts. Until this feature is changed to allow users to prioritise material published in the last few minutes, it limits the site\\u2019s use as a home for breaking news. When Keir Starmer was heckled at an event in Gillingham on Thursday morning, the clip was immediately all over Twitter. But it was far less visible on Threads, which also currently lacks a text search function.\\n\\nInstead, Threads is more like a cross between Twitter and Instagram, with a TikTok-style focus on juicing engagement from posts. You are more likely to see a funny post from the Archbishop of Banterbury meme account than an earnest discussion about a political intervention by his Church of England equivalent.\\n\\nAll of this is bad news for Twitter under Musk, which could retreat even further into being a home for rightwing libertarians arguing over culture war topics. At its best, the experience of being on Twitter in the mid-2010s felt like being able to drop in on the funniest, most interesting party in town. It proved to be one of the best media regulators that has ever existed, a perfect place to rapidly call out shoddy journalism and political lies. It was not necessarily the place where the vast majority of the world found out about things \\u2013 that was Facebook \\u2013 but Twitter was probably where the information was posted first.\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that changed almost a decade ago with the election of Narendra Modi\\u2019s government in India. In the years since then, Kumar has become an increasingly lone voice of truth-telling in an Indian media landscape in thrall to the Hindu nationalist politics of Modi\\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP).

At that time, many of my colleagues would say: \\u2018Well, power comes and power goes.\\u2019 And: \\u2018We have enough experience, Ravish, we have seen many leaders.\\u2019 But my gut was saying: \\u2018No, this is not something that has happened before. Something new is coming.\\u2019 In a very short span of time, the structures of newsrooms were demolished completely. That was not done step by step. It was done in one go.\\u201d\\n\\nShukla\\u2019s film contrasts Kumar\\u2019s meticulous efforts at reporting sectarian violence, or the desperate conditions in rural villages, with the shouty populist news channel Republic, which quickly became the Fox News of Indian media after Modi was elected prime minister. Republic\\u2019s excitable presenters are seen to fuel division and mistrust of the country\\u2019s minority (200 million) Muslim population, to routinely call political opponents of the BJP traitors, to promote warmongering against Pakistan and to neglect to report on the complex issues faced by ordinary Indians. In its manufactured culture wars and unhinged sloganeering, it is, you sense, the channel GB News aspires to be.\\n\\nNow 51, Kumar, a history graduate, had by 2014 been at NDTV for 15 years, having risen from the mail room to become its most trusted and recognisable face. For a long time, the station supported his mission to call out what was happening elsewhere in the media. \\u201cNDTV started running a campaign that said: \\u2018We do not profit from hate,\\u2019\\u201d he says. \\u201cThe owners were trying to save their core values. But in that process, everything became very tough. It was very tedious to always defend themselves.\\u201d Within the station, Kumar occasionally came under pressure to moderate his tone. \\u201cBut if I said no to an editor,\\u201d he says, \\u201cthey took it at once that this is my final word.\\u201d\\n\\nThe aftermath of sectarian clashes in Delhi in February 2020 between Hindus and Muslims protesting a contentious new citizenship law. Photograph: Rajesh Kumar Singh/AP\\n\\nDid it come as a shock to him how shallow the ethical foundations of much of the media proved to be? \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t shocked,\\u201d he says, \\u201cbut I was very pained and deeply hurt that no one stood up to stop this. A lot of [journalists] started making adjustments and those adjustments led them into that room with no windows, only the voice of command, saying: \\u2018You have to do this.\\u2019 And that is what they did.\\u201d\\n\\nThe film records something of the inside story of that playbook of fake news that we have all witnessed happening in plain sight: the undermining of properly sourced information across social media, the seeding of conspiracy theories, the targeting of individual journalists and organisations. There were, and remain, pockets of resistance to this pressure, Kumar insists: \\u201cBut the force of avalanche was such that nobody was untouched in their newsroom, whether he was a senior reporter or whether he was an intern.\\u201d\\n\\nI\\u2019m a very fearful person. I wasn\\u2019t ready to handle that mental trauma. It destroyed me\\n\\nKumar\\u2019s eventual resignation is referenced in the recent scathing Index on Censorship report into the escalating repression by Modi\\u2019s populist government. \\u201cIt has the structures of democracy but it has weakened democracy\\u2019s functions\\u2026 it has a media which is eager to demonstrate how nationalistic and patriotic it is in order to curry favour with the ruling party.\\u201d\\n\\nThat determination is fuelled in part by fear. Seven journalists are now in prison in India and many more have been subject to targeted harassment; eight journalists at the Wire website were charged with sedition in 2021 for reporting that the family of a protester, killed at an anti-government rally, believed he was shot by police. Other news organisations have been subject to blackouts, while some have been raided by police, including the BBC offices in Delhi and Mumbai, which appear to have been singled out after the corporation produced a two-part investigation into Modi\\u2019s alleged history in sectarian violence. India \\u2013 the world\\u2019s most populous nation \\u2013 has been consequently sliding down the UN\\u2019s human rights tables; among the top 10 nations that jails writers and journalists, it is the only \\u201cnominally democratic\\u201d one, according to PEN, the international charity that supports freedom of expression.\\n\\nA threat received by Ravish Kumar, as shown in While We Watched. Photograph: Britdoc Films\\n\\nShukla\\u2019s film examines the effect that the wider climate had on Kumar\\u2019s mental health. \\u201cI\\u2019m a very fearful person,\\u201d he insists, in the face of plenty of evidence to the contrary. \\u201cI had this strong feeling that I should not do anything immoral, but I wasn\\u2019t ready to handle that mental process. It destroyed me. When they launched [the continuous] attacks on me on social media, I could not handle it. I was very terrified, petrified. NDTV understood I needed security \\u2013 but I also needed counselling. I stopped sleeping. I was awake all the time assessing the threat to my life and my family.\\u201d\\n\\nIn addition to the constant wave of texts and calls from people promising to cut his throat, Kumar was pushed around in the street while working. On one occasion he was chased down the road by men with clubs and iron bars, only just making it to his car. The family \\u2013 his wife is an academic and they have two teenage daughters \\u2013 stopped going out together; on the rare occasions they did, he would walk on the other side of the street so they would not all be subjected to any attack.\\n\\nIf TV news is designed to desensitise you, I wanted to use the same form and sensitise people Vinay Shukla, director\\n\\nWatching all that again on Shukla\\u2019s film, he says, was almost too much for him to bear. \\u201cThe first time, I had to shut my eyes because I could not see myself again, going through that process. My daughters haven\\u2019t watched it yet,\\u201d he says, \\u201cMy wife saw it and she was very saddened too, but she\\u2019s a rational person. She said that people who watched the film would be able to see the story of any journalist, not just me.\\u201d He smiles a little ruefully. \\u201cThe other thing I was surprised and amused about,\\u201d he says, \\u201cwas that I finally saw what Vinay had been doing filming me for so many months and years. I used to tell him every day that my life was not exciting: who wants to watch a man get up from the bed and go to work?\\u201d\\n\\nDirector Vinay Shukla.\\n\\nThe director trusts that his story has a wider reference than that. \\u201cI think of the film,\\u201d Shukla says, \\u201cas my love letter to journalism, so that people understand, really, the price that proper journalists have to pay to be able to do their job. We are living in a time of disinformation. The dehumanisation of journalists is [part of that].\\u201d\\n\\nShukla is just about of the generation who came of age with social media. \\u201cI used to watch the news,\\u201d he says. \\u201cBut it used to make me anxious all the time.\\u201d Much of that anxiety, he suggests, is built-in with the attention deficit structure of television news channels, which jump quickly between crisis and disaster and outrage. He has used the fast-cut techniques for his own film \\u2013 but in order to dwell thoughtfully on a single life. \\u201cThere are lots of quick cuts [in While We Watched] but I was hoping to have the opposite impact. If TV news is designed to desensitise you, I wanted to use the same form and sensitise people, to do the complete opposite.\\u201d\\n\\nHe sees an increasing desire for that kind of slowness and depth of inquiry among an emerging generation of Indian documentary-makers, who are using the form as a counterpoint to the noisy chatter of the mainstream media; presenting proper complexity as a political act. Kumar recognises that opportunity and is encouraged to be exhibit A in it.\\n\\n\\u201cI hope that whoever watches this film will see that resistance is possible,\\u201d he says. In the film, he insists that even if one person witnesses the truth, then the political and sectarian lies cannot prevail. \\u201cI have a very deep sense of gratitude to the community of viewers who support me,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThey offered me anything, from a car, to a house, to money, to food. We do not know how many journalists have sacrificed their lives around the world to save this profession. I hope this film brings a ray of hope that it is not easy to kill journalism.\\u201d\\n\\nThe film is released in the UK and the US this month. Shukla is working hard to get it shown in India, lobbying cinemas and streaming platforms, referencing the documentary awards it has won at the Toronto international film festival and elsewhere. Still, as Kumar says, the culture of fear is such that: \\u201cI can\\u2019t imagine that anyone is saying: \\u2018Bring your film, I will put your big poster for it on the front of my cinema hall.\\u2019\\u201d Even so, he suggests, he is confident that the film will be seen: \\u201cLots and lots of people have been asking me how they will be able to see this film in India. Everyone should watch this film. Mr Modi should watch this film.\\u201d\\n\\nA video on Kumar\\u2019s YouTube channel, which has more than 6m subscribers. Photograph: Ravish Kumar / Youtube\\n\\nKumar is not hopeful that fundamental changes in the news media in India \\u2013 equivalent to the dismantling of the BBC \\u2013 can be reversed. The vested interests, including at his old channel NDTV, are now too great. The politically favoured billionaires have taken over.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a point in the film where he suggests that \\u201cpeople don\\u2019t question what they see on TV\\u201d. Given some of the extremes of what they now see, does he imagine that they may start to question that more? \\u201cTo destroy Indian democracy,\\u201d Kumar says, \\u201cIndian media destroyed itself first. And it\\u2019s now very difficult to change this, even if there is a regime change. The news anchors who are spreading hate lies will not go away overnight. This media will never return for democracy. That\\u2019s gone.\\u201d\\n\\nHe does believe, however, that politics may find a way to bypass those structures. \\u201cThe problem with social media,\\u201d he says, \\u201cis that it is rarely getting first-hand information. In India \\u2013 and elsewhere \\u2013 we have seen that social media can run in parallel and [amplify] compromised mainstream media. For this reason, the political opposition in India is going for a lot of mass contact. Rahul Gandhi [the former president of the Indian National Congress party], for example, is constantly on the road. Rallies, meetings, travelling by bus, by car, on foot. I cannot give a deadline that next year\\u2019s election, 2024, will mark the sunrise of new democracy. But I can see that the force of those who believe in democracy is multiplying at a fast rate.\\u201d\\n\\nHow, I wonder, before he finishes our call, is that colonial son Orwell viewed these days in his home town? \\u201cThere is a museum to him,\\u201d Kumar says. \\u201cBut most people are not very aware. It\\u2019s funny, over the years, I started talking about Nineteen Eighty-Four in my various programmes. Recently, the book has been translated into Hindi, along with Animal Farm. When [Donald] Trump was elected in the United States, I remember that Nineteen Eighty-Four suddenly became a very popular book to read and to buy.\\u201d\\n\\nPerhaps, he suggests, that appetite will also be awakened in India. If so, the film of his life makes the perfect primer.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Adam Gabbatt\", \"title\": \"Revealed: Christian \\u2018hate group\\u2019 funds US anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-abortion organizations\", \"description\": \"Alliance Defending Freedom distributes hundreds of thousands of dollars to fringe groups attacking trans, gay and abortion rights A rightwing Christian \\u201chate group\\u201d which is behind a host of legal efforts to roll back abortion rights, remove anti-LGBTQ+ prote\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/30/christian-hate-group-funding-us-anti-lgbtq-anti-abortion-organizations\", \"text\": \"A rightwing Christian \\u201chate group\\u201d which is behind a host of legal efforts to roll back abortion rights, remove LGBTQ+ protections and demonize trans people has seen a huge increase in its funding and has funneled some of that money to a slew of smaller anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-abortion groups across the US, the Guardian can reveal.\\n\\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a registered non-profit behind the ongoing 303 Creative supreme court case which could chip away at LGBTQ+ rights, saw its revenue surge by more than $25m between 2020 and 2021, a period in which a rightwing obsession with transgender rights and sexual orientation saw almost 200 anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced in states around the US.\\n\\nThe surge in funding to the ADF, which has been termed an \\u201canti-LGBTQ hate group\\u201d by the Southern Poverty Law Center, saw it record revenue of $104.5m in 2021, according to filings with the Internal Revenue Service.\\n\\nIt has handed over hundreds of thousands of dollars of that newfound wealth to fringe organizations which have sought to diminish the rights of trans students in schools and the right for trans people to participate in sports, an investigation by the watchdog group Accountable.US has found.\\n\\nThe ADF, which was founded in 1994 by a group of \\u201cleaders in the Christian community\\u201d, according to its website, has also given money to groups involved in efforts to ban books which address LGBTQ+ topics, and to organizations which seek to ban abortion.\\n\\nIt comes as Republican politicians and commentators continue to wage a culture war in the US. In June the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the country\\u2019s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy group, declared a \\u201cstate of emergency\\u201d for LGBTQ+ people in the US, citing \\u201can unprecedented and dangerous spike in anti-LGBTQ+ legislative assaults sweeping state houses this year\\u201d.\\n\\nAn HRC report this month found that 75 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were signed into law in the first five months of 2023 \\u2013 more than double the entire amount passed in 2022.\\n\\n\\u201cAlliance Defending Freedom is a recognized anti-LGBTQ hate group working to build a movement of far-right legal groups to force a dangerous, unpopular agenda on Americans,\\u201d said Kyle Herrig, president of Accountable.US, a progressive organization which researches the finances and activities of special interest groups.\\n\\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom\\u2019s goal is to strip Americans of their rights and undermine democracy Kyle Herrig of Accountable.US\\n\\n\\u201cFrom ADF\\u2019s involvement with a supreme court case contesting critical LGBTQ rights to the hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding ADF has granted to anti-democratic organizations, ADF\\u2019s goal is to strip Americans of their rights and undermine democracy.\\u201d\\n\\nThe ADF\\u2019s most high-profile current case is the lawsuit 303 Creative, Inc v Elenis, which the supreme court decided on Friday.\\n\\nThe plaintiff, 303 Creative, is a website design company. 303 Creative has never made wedding websites, but its owner, Lorie Smith, claimed her first amendment rights were infringed because, if she were to start making wedding websites, she would not want to make them for same-sex couples \\u2013 which would violate Colorado\\u2019s anti-discrimination laws. The court found in 303\\u2019s favor.\\n\\nThe ADF\\u2019s rightwing advocacy extends further, however, as the organization has donated to more than a dozen anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-abortion groups.\\n\\nAccountable.US found that the ADF donated $85,000 to the Child and Parental Rights Campaign, a group which, according to a Politico report, helped Florida Republicans shape the state\\u2019s so-called \\u201cdon\\u2019t say gay\\u201d law, which prohibits discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools.\\n\\nThe group has also sued two school districts in Florida over issues relating to the rights of trans youth. One case saw the Child and Parental Rights Campaign sue the Leon county school district, complaining that teachers had allowed a child to choose their preferred pronouns. The case was dismissed by a judge in January.\\n\\nThe Women\\u2019s Liberation Front (WLF), a group which previously campaigned against the Obama administration providing protections for transgender students in schools, received $50,000 from the ADF the same year.\\n\\nA self-described \\u201cradical feminist\\u201d organization, the WLF has been called an \\u201canti-trans hate group\\u201d by Glaad, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, and appears to have developed a specific focus on restricting trans children\\u2019s access to sports.\\n\\nThe WLF has partnered with rightwing organizations as it has attempted, and sometimes succeeded, to restrict trans people\\u2019s rights in the US. Members of the group have testified in support of legislation which restricts transgender treatments for youth in South Dakota, and have criticized Biden\\u2019s executive orders on gender identity.\\n\\nAnother beneficiary of the ADF\\u2019s largesse was the Kriegshauser Ney Law Group, which in 2022 brought a lawsuit, with the ADF, on behalf of a Kansas teacher who refused to use transgender or non-binary students\\u2019 preferred pronouns. The Geary county school district settled with the teacher for $95,000.\\n\\nThe Ethics and Public Policy Center, which filed an amicus brief supporting the ADF in the 303 Creative case, received $78,000. Leonard Leo, an influential rightwing activist who helped Donald Trump select three supreme court justices, serves as a director for the group, which has also supported a case which challenges FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Start the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day\\u2019s must-reads from across the Guardian Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Seven of the eight quarter-finalists were European but there was only ever going to be one winner. This time, the destination of the trophy is less obvious. A whole host of teams have a serious chance to deny the US, a team that are always potent but who are in transition, a third successive crown.\\n\\nEngland may be without a number of stars, but they have one of the best managers in the world in Sarina Wiegman and capable backup players. The Euro 2022 runners-up, Germany, have most of their players fit and a strong year behind them. Spain have performed exceptionally, even without some of their biggest names in the mix.\\n\\nFrance finally have some stability with their new manager, Herv\\u00e9 Renard, in post. Sweden reached the semi-finals in 2019 and were runners-up at the Olympics in Tokyo.\\n\\nThe tumult in the France camp during the buildup appears to have eased. Photograph: Melanie Laurent/DPPI/Shutterstock\\n\\nAustralia are the dark horses. The prospect of watching Sam Kerr on the world stage on home soil is spine-tingling. She is a big-game player but she also has a host of talent around her. With a home crowd behind them and the never-say-die Kerr spearheading the attack, Australia could have their own World Cup 1999 or Euro 2022 moment.\\n\\nExpect players to challenge the status quo too. In 2019 it was Megan Rapinoe duelling with then president of the United States, Donald Trump, championing LGBTQ+ rights and the US team leading the call for equal pay.\\n\\nLast year, players challenged the decision that left their male counterparts unable to wear the \\u201cone love\\u201d armband in Qatar and spoke out against human rights abuses and lack of rights for women in the country. At the Euros, England players challenged the government to commit to equal access to football in schools. There will be no shying away from the big issues \\u2013 players will maximise their opportunity to fight for change while in the global spotlight.\\n\\nOn and off the pitch, this should be a World Cup to remember.

Get in now, was the message, before it was too late.\\n\\nHe couldn\\u2019t avoid seeing parallels with the bedtime story \\u2013 that it relied on people buying into an idea that, he suspected, may prove to be a mirage. Getting to the part when it was a child who calls out the truth of the emperor\\u2019s \\u201cclothes\\u201d, he had a thought: maybe I\\u2019m that child. \\u201cI mean, what do I know?\\u201d he says now, with a laugh. McKenzie is an actor, a former teen heart-throb known for his role in the mid-2000s drama The OC and who recently starred in the superhero crime TV series Gotham. Even with his 20-plus-year-old economics degree, he seemed an unlikely anti-crypto crusader. \\u201cBut when in life do you have a chance to have an adventure?\\u201d he says. \\u201cWhat did I have to lose?\\u201d\\n\\nWe meet in a studio in London; the whole family are in the UK, where McKenzie\\u2019s wife, the actor Morena Baccarin, is shooting the third Deadpool film. Spare a thought for his daughter, seven and delightful, who is with her dad today and patiently waiting for him to finish (he has two children, plus a stepson from Baccarin\\u2019s first marriage). McKenzie is about to publish a book, Easy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud, which he has written with the journalist Jacob Silverman. It\\u2019s an entertaining caper, spiked with barely concealed fury at the people complicit in crypto\\u2019s rise to become an almost \\u00a33tn industry at its peak in 2021 \\u2013 the CEOs, politicians and celebrities who took advertising money \\u2013 and its collapse, which picked up speed in 2022 and swallowed many ordinary people\\u2019s savings. \\u201cUnfortunately, poorer folks disproportionately got in later,\\u201d he says, of those who bought during the boom.\\n\\nWhat makes me most angry is the selling of this junk to people who cannot afford to lose the real money they have\\n\\nMcKenzie is the accidental investigative journalist in what he calls his \\u201cbizarre career pivot\\u201d, occasionally deploying his self-deprecatingly described \\u201cmid-level celebrity\\u201d to such missions as getting into a social media company-sponsored party \\u2013 the same night a CIA operative comically tries to recruit the co-authors \\u2013 or smoothing the path to an interview with the crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried, through his OC-fan assistant.

Photograph: Warner Bros Tv/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock\\n\\nMcKenzie\\u2019s interest started during the early days of the pandemic. TV production had shut down and in the midst of \\u201cboredom and a midlife crisis\\u201d, he says with a laugh, he became curious. He considered buying crypto but the more he read, about bubbles and economic history, the more suspicious he became: \\u201cBubbles go parabolic up right at the end, and then parabolic down, usually. That\\u2019s where I felt we were, like this was not sustainable. But in times of mania, it\\u2019s herd mentality and everyone just piles on.\\u201d It was, he thought, \\u201cpotentially a massive Ponzi scheme. I hadn\\u2019t quite decided that, but I knew it was a bubble.\\u201d\\n\\nMcKenzie hadn\\u2019t been aware he\\u2019d been looking for a project, but suddenly here one was. He hoped that with his profile and rediscovered interest in economics he might make people question the boom. He contacted Silverman, a New Republic journalist whose piece headlined Even Donald Trump Knows Bitcoin Is a Scam he had enjoyed, and they met for a drink.\\n\\nMcKenzie suggested they collaborate on a book. \\u201cIt felt like something I could do, because I know a little bit about money, but I know about lying \\u2013 I do it for a living,\\u201d he says. His career had taught him about hype, and bubbles \\u2013 he\\u2019d lived through his own. McKenzie had discovered acting at university. He had never planned to be an economist but was vaguely thinking about becoming a lawyer, like his father. Then he auditioned for university plays, loved it, and within a couple of years of graduating he had the lead role in The OC. The show became an instant hit. Being one of the most famous young actors in the world at the time \\u201cwas a really fun experience, one I could never have imagined having, but a learning experience as well, let\\u2019s say. You talk about the parabolic rise and fall.\\u201d He laughs. \\u201cYou\\u2019re never the hottest thing for ever.\\u201d\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Photograph: Jessica Miglio/AP\\n\\nThe similarities between the cryptocurrency industry and Hollywood? Ultimately, it comes down to marketing. \\u201cIf crypto doesn\\u2019t have a product, which I would argue it does not, then what are you buying when you\\u2019re buying these bits of code? It\\u2019s just a story.\\u201d An appealing one, he adds. It claimed to be inclusive for people who, for various reasons, usually of inequality, didn\\u2019t have traditional bank accounts. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to build generational wealth, it\\u2019s going to democratise and decentralise the future of money,\\u201d he says. \\u201cNone of it\\u2019s true.\\u201d He understands why people were drawn in. \\u201cI almost was. It had, at least on paper, or screen, made money for a bunch of people. Even if at the end of the day it actually hadn\\u2019t because they couldn\\u2019t get the money out when the price crashed.\\u201d\\n\\nThere are plenty of things one could be upset about right now. Why did he feel so strongly about cryptocurrency? \\u201cBecause it\\u2019s wrong!\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s terrible. If I was right \\u2013 and this was two years ago \\u2013 there were signs, historically.\\u201d He and Silverman started writing articles. Their first, for Slate, criticised McKenzie\\u2019s fellow celebrities, such as Kim Kardashian and NFL star Tom Brady, who had endorsed crypto companies. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just gross,\\u201d says McKenzie. \\u201cShowbiz is a hustle, and there is money to be made by selling products, which is fine, but this is different. This is not soap or car insurance. This is an unregulated, unlicensed security, in my opinion, and you are effectively offering financial advice, whether you say you are or not.\\u201d (Kardashian was later fined $1.3m by the Securities and Exchange Commission; the \\u201ctoken\\u201d she was promoting is now virtually worthless.) One hilariously overblown ad fronted by Matt Damon likened crypto investing to the pinnacles of human achievement, such as mountaineering and space exploration. McKenzie laughs. \\u201cNo, you\\u2019re just a guy in a studio with a black T-shirt on, pointing at random [CGI] stuff that doesn\\u2019t even exist.

He essentially bet $250,000 that the crypto market would collapse but got the timing wrong and lost most of it. Did that make him question his position? \\u201cOh yeah. And it made me think about how to tell my wife, which is where a lot of crypto people [who have made big losses] have gotten.\\u201d He smiles. \\u201cIt was an expensive lesson. But it was a luxury that I had the money to speculate with. What makes me most angry is the selling of this junk to people who cannot afford to lose the real money they have, and the complicity of the people that did that.\\u201d\\n\\nWith everyone seemingly in thrall to crypto during the boom, it felt isolating at first. \\u201cAs soon as I met fellow sceptics, I was like: \\u2018Ah, these are my people,\\u2019 just a great group of nerds \\u2013 cryptographers, computer scientists, economists, a lot of amateur sleuths.\\u201d He didn\\u2019t find much dissent in the media, which saddened him. \\u201cThere was a lot of just putting out press releases, basically. I saw so much drivel.\\u201d\\n\\nBankman-Fried, founder of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange and at one point the world\\u2019s youngest billionaire, was the subject of many breathless media profiles. McKenzie built up a relationship with him before meeting for an interview \\u2013 this was months before his businesses spectacularly collapsed last year and he was arrested on criminal charges, including fraud and money laundering. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t know what we know now, but there were red flags,\\u201d says McKenzie. On a personal level, McKenzie wasn\\u2019t impressed with the young man routinely described as the next Warren Buffett or JP Morgan. His empire, McKenzie felt, was \\u201cfar more rickety than I had even suspected. He\\u2019s the guy? That\\u2019s your JP Morgan?\\u201d\\n\\nMcKenzie and Silverman spoke to politicians, and looked into the \\u201crevolving door\\u201d between politicos who then go to work for these companies, and the huge donations from crypto firms; Bankman-Fried\\u2019s companies alone donated at least \\u00a3100m between Democrats and Republicans. Did it surprise McKenzie, or is he cynical enough by now? \\u201cI thought I was cynical,\\u201d he says with a grim smile.\\n\\nWhat has this experience done for McKenzie? \\u201cIt\\u2019s been an incredible adventure,\\u201d he says. He has reported from El Salvador, which recognises bitcoin as legal tender, visited environmentally disastrous cryptocurrency mining facilities and, at the end of last year, he found himself testifying before the Senate banking committee. \\u201cIt\\u2019s given me a broader understanding of diversity of experiences. I\\u2019ve formed genuine friendships.\\u201d\\n\\nHe doesn\\u2019t know what he will do next. He still believes crypto has no real-world use or value but he hasn\\u2019t, I point out, successfully brought cryptocurrency down and he laughs. (For the crypto survivors, the market appears to be recovering even if the regulators are circling. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not a fair market, most of the volume is fake, there\\u2019s very real liquidity, meaning the real money, backing it,\\u201d counters McKenzie.) Crypto will be around, he says, \\u201cas long as people believe in it. The brilliance of the con is it points out something we can all agree on \\u2013 the financial system is unequal \\u2013 and then pivot: \\u2018crypto solves it\\u2019.\\u201d He smiles. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the trick \\u2013 it doesn\\u2019t.\\u201d\\n\\nWe could continue to choose to ignore those flaws in traditional finance, but McKenzie doesn\\u2019t think we should. \\u201cWe made [the financial system] up, just like we made up money, so we can change it \\u2013 but it does require work and it does require we speak the truth.\\u201d\\n\\nEasy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud is published on 27 July by Abrams.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Victoria Amelina\", \"title\": \"Victoria Amelina: Ukraine and the meaning of home\", \"description\": \"Before she was killed by a Russian missile strike, the acclaimed novelist and war crimes researcher wrote about growing up in Moscow\\u2019s shadow, and how she came to understand what being Ukrainian really meantVictoria Amelina, an award-winning novelist, essayis\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/06/victoria-amelina-novelist-kramatorsk-russia-ukraine-war-meaning-of-home\", \"text\": \"Victoria Amelina, an award-winning novelist, essayist and poet, died on 1 July from injuries sustained in a Russian missile attack on a restaurant in eastern Ukraine.

I remember singing Wind of Change by the German band the Scorpions at an international summer camp near Pskov, then the Soviet Union, in 1990, and feeling like the lyrics truly spoke to me: \\u201cThe world is closing in / and did you ever think / that we could be so close, like brothers?\\u201d Were we all \\u201cchildren of tomorrow\\u201d, dreaming and believing in a better future? Where are we now?\\n\\nThe winds of change turned out to be nothing more than an illusion, and my belief in it only shows that, culturally and mentally, Ukraine has always been a part of the somewhat naive west. The difference is that the Ukrainians were destined to face the truth eventually. Some learned it from the stories of Ukrainian dissidents like the poet Vasyl Stus, who was murdered in a Russian penal colony five years before Wind of Change was released. Others, like me, had to experience the Russian world first-hand to realise that the border between Russia and Ukraine is not a redundancy or a formality, but essential for our survival.\\n\\nIt seems that we are all doomed to repeat our mistakes if we don\\u2019t know where our home \\u2013 the safe space of trust \\u2013 ends, and which of its borders need to be especially well guarded.\\n\\nI was born in western Ukraine in 1986, the year the Chornobyl nuclear reactor exploded and the Soviet Union began to crumble. Despite my birthplace and the timing of my birth, I was educated to be Russian. There was an entire system in place that aimed to make me believe that Moscow, not Kyiv, was the centre of my universe. I attended a Russian school, performed in a school theatre named after the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin and prayed in the Russian Orthodox church. I even enjoyed a summer camp for teenagers in Russia, and attended youth gatherings at the Russian cultural centre in Lviv, where we sang so-called Russian rock music, which was actually more honest about the changes happening in Russia than the naive compositions of the Scorpions.\\n\\nVictoria Amelina\\n\\nWhen I was 15, I won a local competition and was chosen to represent my home town, Lviv, at an international Russian language contest in Moscow. I was excited to visit the Russian capital. Moscow felt like the centre of what I considered home. My library was full of Russian classics, and even though the Soviet Union had collapsed almost a decade earlier, not much had changed in the Russian school I attended, or on Russian TV, which my family had the habit of watching. Additionally, while I didn\\u2019t even have the money to travel around Ukraine, Russia was happy to invest in my Russianisation.\\n\\nAt the contest in Moscow I met kids from all those countries Russia would later try to invade or assimilate: Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova. The Russian Federation invested a lot of money in raising children like us from the \\u201cformer Soviet republics\\u201d as Russians. They probably invested more in us than they did in the education of children in rural Russia: those who were already conquered didn\\u2019t need to be tempted with summer camps and excursions to Red Square.\\n\\nHopefully, I will have turned out to be one of the worst investments the Russian Federation ever made.\\n\\nIn Moscow, a famous journalist from ORT, a top Russian TV channel at the time, approached me for an interview on the evening news. I was flattered, I felt like a star. The journalist started with a polite question about how I was enjoying the event and the Russian capital, but quickly moved on to her real agenda. \\u201cHow oppressed do you feel as a Russian speaker in the west of Ukraine? How dangerous is it to speak Russian on the streets of your home town, Lviv?\\u201d\\n\\nI gasped as I realised that I wasn\\u2019t a star at all; I was just being used to manipulate millions of viewers of the evening news. The huge camera was watching me and a big, professional microphone was in front of me for the first time in my life. I was only 15 years old. But in that split second, I had to figure out where the borders of my home were. I wasn\\u2019t Russian, after all \\u2013 I was a Ukrainian kid brought to Moscow to reinforce certain Russian narratives. I may have believed that Russia was a great country with peace at its core, but I only felt that way because of watching the very channel that was now trying to exploit an inexperienced 15-year-old.\\n\\n\\u201cAfter our complex history, it would only be natural for Ukrainians to feel uncomfortable and react at times to the Russian language,\\u201d I replied. \\u201cHowever, I don\\u2019t experience any oppression. Maybe your information is outdated? I am young, and there\\u2019s no such problem among the younger generation.\\u201d\\n\\nThe journalist tried to ask me again, but my responses weren\\u2019t going to change. She had already failed. I doubt they aired this interview on the evening news. Or perhaps they managed to edit it in a way that suited their agenda. Now, as a Ukrainian writer, I receive requests for interviews from various Russian channels, but I decline them all. My Moscow experience was quite enough.\\n\\nA local resident walks among the remains of the restaurant destroyed by a Russian missile strike on Kramatorsk on 27 June. Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nI remembered this story in 2022, watching an interview with an elderly man in Mariupol. He was desperate, disoriented and disarmingly honest. \\u201cBut I believed in this Russian world, can you imagine? All my life I believed we were brothers!\\u201d the poor man exclaimed, surrounded by the ruins of his beloved city. The man\\u2019s apartment building was in ruins and the illusion of home, the space he perceived as his motherland, the former Soviet Union where he was born and lived his best years, had been crushed even more brutally. The propaganda stopped working on him only when the Russian bombs fell. The border between independent Ukraine and the Russian Federation arose in his mind as a crucial barrier, just like it did in mine when I realised I had only been brought to festive Moscow to lie about my home town in Ukraine, so that the Russian viewers could hate it even more.\\n\\nI think most people would now agree that a wall between us and Russia is a good solution until Russian society undergoes significant changes. A world where every neighbour is a friend is a nice idea to sing about, but where Russia is concerned, it is unfortunately not so realistic.\\n\\nIt is tempting to believe in the simple, inspiring concept of welcoming everyone as a friend and brother. But does this approach actually work? In a very different winter in 2019, I saw another collision between the imaginary idyll, where borders can be crossed in search of miracles, and a harsher reality. As my family and I prepared to celebrate Christmas in Boston, Massachusetts, I found myself standing among a forest of trees, promising my son that we would choose the best one. Despite my lack of experience in choosing Christmas trees (in Ukraine, we had always used an old, artificial, but reusable one), I regretted not looking up some advice beforehand.\\n\\nI needed to ask the seller for help selecting a tree, but he seemed too busy with other customers and clearly needed to sell all the trees, even the poor quality ones. However, I knew what would get him to pay attention to us. I simply mentioned that this would be our first Christmas in the United States, which was true. And the \\u201cWelcome to America\\u201d magic began. The man immediately made us his priority and helped us find the perfect tree. He seemed to be one of those true Americans who believe that welcoming newcomers is at the core of American values.\\n\\nI knew of course that this value was shared by many in the US, but not everyone. After all, it was the time when Donald Trump was president. As I walked the streets of Cambridge, I always stopped to look at a picture of a child that had been attached to a church fence \\u2013 one of those children who had been separated from their parents and detained at the border, and had not survived. The only crime of the little girl in the picture was crossing the border from Mexico into the US with her parents, who were only trying to give her a better life.\\n\\nThe Christmas tree seller was just as angry about the family separation policy in the US as I was. But Trump supporters had different ideas about what the country was and how its borders should be protected. It was incomprehensible to me why it was so difficult for Mexican migrants to cross into the US in 2019, yet so easy for Russian soldiers to cross the border into Ukraine in 2022.\\n\\nOne thing remains indisputable: humanity constantly messes up with borders. Much like adolescents unsure about their identity, we let the wrong people in and keep the right ones out. We pay too much attention to appearances, including not only the colour of our skin, but the colour of our passports; instead we could pay more attention to core values like freedom, dignity and the rule of law, which we either do or do not share. Yet some of us are easily tricked by strangers, like I was when I admired Russia as a kid, or we are too scared of them, like Americans clamouring for a wall to keep Mexicans out. Why are we so wrong in choosing who to trust? Perhaps it\\u2019s because we don\\u2019t know how to trust each other in our own countries.\\n\\nAs a writer, I tend to think of home as the narrative shared by its inhabitants. People and places come about in stories: poets, playwrights, ancient prophets and novelists have all imagined the countries and cities we live in now, and their stories have greatly affected us and our relations with one another. But what story do we all fit into? My answer is complicated and straightforward: the only story we all can fit into is a true one.\\n\\nThe National Museum of the Holodomor-Genocide in Kyiv. Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images\\n\\nThe true history of Ukraine is complex, painful and dramatic. For a long time, no book reflected my family\\u2019s experience or explained why I didn\\u2019t inherit the Ukrainian language from my grandparents. Their decision to protect their kids (my parents) by raising them to speak Russian was inexplicable to me as a child. Growing up speaking Russian made me feel out of place. So eventually, I had to write a novel about families like mine. My home town Lviv was in the heart of the \\u201cBloodlands\\u201d, as the historian Timothy Snyder calls the lands from the Baltic to the Black Sea. I had to discover that the Soviet army killed thousands of Ukrainians early on in the second world war. And that around 100,000 Jewish citizens of Lviv perished in the same period.\\n\\nMy family lived through the trauma of the Holodomor, also called the Great Famine, which took place from 1932-33, but my grandparents never talked in detail about it. Silence creates cracks so deep that it is hardly possible to feel at home. When stories about the Holocaust or Holodomor are not fully revealed, we\\u2019re bound not to trust each other. Who were you in 1933? The hungry one or the one taking all the food? The one who shot Ukrainian activists in 1941, or the one who searched for their loved one among the decomposing bodies? The scared one watching from the window when Jews were taken away or the one who took them? The one who wrote to the KGB about your neighbour or the one who helped Ukrainian dissidents? There were silences instead of the much-needed stories. And where there\\u2019s a lack of true stories, there is a lack of trust. We are bound to believe the propaganda and draw all the wrong borders again and again, never feeling completely at home.\\n\\nIn Ukraine, everything changed in the first days of December 2013, at the beginning of the Revolution of Dignity, when protesters took to the streets after President Yanukovych rejected closer ties with Europe in favour of Moscow. After the police severely beat students on Independence Square in Kyiv, it became clear that this was a time to prevent Ukraine from turning into an authoritarian state like Russia or Belarus. Everyone who felt like a free Ukrainian had to take the risk of heading to the Maidan. But what if others didn\\u2019t have the courage to join the demonstration? Then the few brave ones would be powerless against police violence. To take to the streets of Kyiv, we had to take the risk of trusting each other.\\n\\nEventually, up to half a million people showed up. That\\u2019s when we knew we could count on each other. Ukraine finally felt like home to me, too. Home isn\\u2019t a magical, perfect place, but a place where, if you are being beaten by the police, you can be sure that your neighbours will show up to take a stand for you.\\n\\nPeople gathered at the Maidan in Kyiv in February 2014. Photograph: Fabrice Elsner/SIPA/REX\\n\\nThe old silences didn\\u2019t disappear miraculously, but after 2013 we trusted each other enough to build platforms and institutions that deal with our traumatic past as well. And after the Revolution of Dignity, there was a new true story, in which the question \\u201cWho are you?\\u201d was being answered by everyone every day in 2014. There was war at our doors, fighting continued in the Donbas region, but our vision was as clear as ever.\\n\\nIn the spring and summer of 2014, I was sure a full-scale Russian invasion had already begun, and that the brutality would intensify and gradually spread throughout Ukraine. I packed my three-year-old son\\u2019s belongings into an emergency backpack so we would be ready to hide in a bomb shelter at any moment. At that time, the bombs didn\\u2019t fall on us; Russia annexed Crimea and ruined the lives of Ukrainians in Donetsk and Luhansk, but didn\\u2019t go further in full force. The world didn\\u2019t react. So the borders of my home were clear: they were Ukraine\\u2019s borders. No one had our backs but us.\\n\\nWe had each other, and that was invaluable. But what about the beautiful vision? If we couldn\\u2019t yet achieve the perfect world where we all supported one another, what about our cosy continent, Europe? Those years of the initial Russian invasion, 2014-2015, were a time when many Ukrainians felt betrayed not only by Russia, but also by the west, for not coming to our aid. We were Europeans under attack, but it was mainly our problem.\\n\\nIn November 1956, the director of the Hungarian news agency sent a message via telex to the world, shortly before Russian artillery wrecked his office. It read: \\u201cWe are going to die for Hungary and for Europe.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Czech writer Milan Kundera started his 1984 essay The Tragedy of Central Europe with this message. As one of the leading figures of the 1968 Prague Spring, Kundera understood what the brave Hungarian had meant by dying for Europe. As a Ukrainian writer in Kyiv in 2022, I can\\u2019t stop thinking about Kundera, writing in exile after the Prague Spring failed. We, Central Europeans, are ready to fight for Europe, even if at times our love may be unrequited.\\n\\nEurope didn\\u2019t come to Hungary\\u2019s rescue. Nor did it come to the Czechs\\u2019 rescue, or the Ukrainians\\u2019 in 2014. If being a Central European means being betrayed by Europe, Ukraine is certainly a member of the club.\\n\\nHowever, when Russia started the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Europe did take in fleeing Ukrainians and accepted us unconditionally.\\n\\nI was out of the country at the time of the invasion. My flight from Egypt back to Ukraine was scheduled for 7am on 24 February 2022. The flight got cancelled, of course; Russia was bombing Ukrainian airports from Kyiv to Ivano-Frankivsk. \\u201cDo you know what happened?\\u201d the Egyptian official asked me as soon as we entered the terminal. I didn\\u2019t reply for a moment, so he kept repeating as if allowing me time to take it in: \\u201cYou cannot go to your country.\\u201d\\n\\nWe stood for a long time amid a desperate crowd of Ukrainians, but eventually we were the only ones left in the tiny airport. The rest of the Ukrainians had left the building, heading to buses laid on by their tour agency.\\n\\nThat day, I bought overpriced tickets from Egypt to Prague, where Milan Kundera had fought for his home and Europe in 1968. At Hurghada airport, citizens of the European Union checked in casually and headed to the security control area; all Ukrainian citizens were asked to wait on one side. We tried to explain that Ukrainians had been able to travel to the European Union without visas for several years. But the airline workers replied that that didn\\u2019t matter now: Prague had to tell the Egyptian side whether they were ready to let us into the country.\\n\\n\\u201cAnd what if they won\\u2019t let us in?\\u201d my 10-year-old son asked me quietly.\\n\\nI didn\\u2019t know what to answer and just squeezed my son\\u2019s hand.\\n\\nOther Ukrainians and I waited for the decision from Prague for about an hour, discussing rumours about a Ukrainian man who wasn\\u2019t allowed to board his flight to Germany earlier in the day. Then the verdict was announced to us: \\u201cYou can go.\\u201d\\n\\nPeople fleeing the war in Ukraine cross the border into Poland in March 2022. Photograph: Omar Marques/Getty Images\\n\\nEven when we got to Prague airport, I wasn\\u2019t sure what would happen. The Czech border officer glanced at our passports and then looked at us. She was more interested in the expressions on our faces than in our passport details: maybe she was new at the job and hadn\\u2019t yet seen people whose country was being bombarded by the Russian Federation. I think she was looking at us with compassion. Then she just stamped our passports without asking any questions. And I realised that she knew; the whole world was looking at us. I started crying and couldn\\u2019t stop, and when my son asked why I was crying, I replied:\\n\\n\\u201cBecause we are home.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cBut this is not Ukraine,\\u201d he argued.\\n\\n\\u201cThis is Europe,\\u201d I answered, as if this word \\u201cEurope\\u201d should explain everything to my child.\\n\\nWe were falling, and our fellow Europeans were ready to catch us. The limits of home may have just expanded, I thought.\\n\\nA bit later, I learned that train tickets in the Czech Republic and in Poland were free for Ukrainian citizens who had just fled their homeland. I travelled by train from Prague to Poland, and on the third day of the invasion, finally crossed the border back into Ukraine.\\n\\nAt the Polish-Ukrainian border, I witnessed indescribable desperation and fear. Little kids were pulling heavy suitcases, their frightened grandmas and mothers looking even more disoriented than them. I heard screams in the crowd as people were squeezed in the crush, and the loud voice of the border guard trying to get the refugees\\u2019 attention and prevent a tragedy. Yet all these people were going to be accepted and even welcomed into the EU. They might not have known it at the time \\u2013 cold, hungry, and fearful at the border \\u2013 but at that very moment the boundaries of their home, Europe, were being expanded to include Ukraine.\\n\\nEurope was home, and it proved to be a space where we could count on each other, as Ukrainians counted on each other at the Maidan in 2014.\\n\\nWe Ukrainians are well aware of the discussions surrounding Europe\\u2019s acceptance of Ukrainian refugees. While I share the concerns about racism and Islamophobia, I believe that what happened to Ukrainian refugees was more than just an act of kindness. It was a change in perspective, a change in the story of Europe, and ultimately a change in the borders of what Ukrainians and other Europeans consider their shared home. Ukrainians are now fighting not just for Ukraine, but for Europe as well.\\n\\nThis may not be much help to refugees from Syria or Sudan, unfortunately. But I believe that acts of kindness towards one group of refugees can teach us all, including Ukrainians, to be more kind to all other people fleeing wars. We can sing about a utopian brotherhood, or we can work diligently to expand the limits of the fragile shared trust we have. Despite all the obstacles, I still believe that the dream of a world without borders should be our inspiration. We may never fully realise this vision, but it can turn into a strategy that changes reality for the better.\\n\\nNo one is obliged to take in a stranger or show them love, yet it happens. This love becomes a true story that changes all future stories, including those of refugees.\\n\\nIn June 2022, I arrived in Brussels and took a bus from the airport to the city. I was headed to a meeting at the European parliament to discuss accountability for Russian war crimes. The bus was full of men in suits, all clearly headed to European institutions as well. However, I was perhaps the only one who noticed the irony of the song that opened the bus playlist: \\u201cI follow the Moskva, down to Gorky Park \\u2026\\u201d the Scorpions frontman sang. The bureaucrats in their expensive suits kept typing on their laptops, paying no attention to the song and the story it conveyed. I knew I didn\\u2019t fit into this story. But I knew that we came to Brussels to write a new narrative for everyone, not to change some lousy playlist on an airport shuttle.\\n\\nThis piece is adapted from an essay first published as part of the International Writing Program\\u2019s Home/Land/s symposium\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Helen Livingstone\", \"title\": \"Russia-Ukraine war live: traffic stopped on Crimean bridge due to \\u2018emergency\\u2019, governor says, as explosions reported\", \"description\": \"Russia-installed governor Sergei Aksyonov says \\u2018measures\\u2019 are being taken to restore \\u2018situation\\u2019 at bridge, which is a vital logistical link for Russian military<ul><li>Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 509 of the invasion</li></ul>Hello and\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/17/russia-ukraine-war-live-crimean-bridge-emergency-traffic-stops-explosion\", \"text\": \"From 17 Jul 2023 13.31 EDT Putin says Russia preparing response to Crimea bridge attack The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Monday his defence ministry was preparing proposals for a response to the overnight attack that damaged the road bridge linking Crimea to southern Russia, for which he blamed Ukraine.

Erik Connolly, now has another shot to be on top.\\n\\nConnolly is representing Smartmatic in another lawsuit against Fox News, which is still ongoing.\\n\\nAfter Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, his legal team pushed false conspiracy theories alleging the election was stolen. Two of the then-president's lawyers, Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, falsely claimed that election technology companies Dominion and Smartmatic were secretly in cahoots with each other and deployed their technology to flip votes from Trump to now-President Joe Biden.\\n\\nDominion and Smartmatic each brought defamation lawsuits against Fox News. Fox and other media organizations advanced the false theories by allowing Powell and Giuliani to speak freely on their networks, the companies have alleged.\\n\\nJust as a trial was set to begin in Delaware state court, in April, Fox agreed to settle Dominion's claims for the record-breaking sum.\\n\\nBut Smartmatic's lawsuit continues going forward, playing out in a New York state court. (Giuliani is also a defendant in the case; Smartmatic's case against Powell is moving forward in Washington, DC, for jurisdictional reasons.)\\n\\nExperts told Insider that the $787.5 million settlement is a strong benchmark for Smartmatic \\u2014 and that Smartmatic will likely get more.\\n\\n\\\"When Fox settled the Dominion case, it knew, or reasonably should have known, that it would be establishing a precedent or a benchmark that Smartmatic would try to exceed in its case,\\\" Clay Calvert, a First Amendment expert and nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told Insider.\\n\\nA better benchmark might be a cool $1 billion, according to James Goodale, a former lawyer for the New York Times and experienced First Amendment litigator.\\n\\n\\\"I think the number will float around that, $1 billion, one way or another,\\\" he said.\\n\\nSmartmatic wants more than Dominion. Fox says it isn't worth that much.\\n\\nSmartmatic's lawsuit alleges $2.7 billion in damages. The company's technology played a role in just one county in the 2020 election. In a series of appendices filed to court, Smartmatic has shown that it arrived at the $2.7 billion figure by adding up its forecasted lost profits in different regions worldwide because of what it says are canceled contracts. While Dominion has a large footprint in the US, Smartmatic does more work across Africa and Europe, according to the filings.\\n\\n\\\"Smartmatic's original projections are now unachievable as a result of Defendants' disinformation campaign,\\\" lawyers for the company wrote in its lawsuit against Fox.\\n\\nFox is battling Smartmatic's lawsuit in court, calling it an assault on the First Amendment's protections for free speech.\\n\\n\\\"We will be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial, likely in 2025,\\\" a Fox spokesperson told Insider. \\\"As a report prepared by our financial expert shows, Smartmatic's damages claims are implausible, disconnected from reality, and on its face intended to chill First Amendment freedoms.\\\"\\n\\nFox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch. Victoria Jones/PA Images via Getty Images)\\n\\nIn court filings and public statements, Fox has characterized Smartmatic's damages demand as ludicrous. It hired a corporate law expert who looked at Smartmatic's underlying finances and argues it isn't worth nearly as much as it says.\\n\\nAccording to Fox's filings, Smartmatic's revenue has been largely shrinking since 2012. The \\\"extravagant\\\" damages claim is \\\"divorced from reality\\\" because it was losing money, Fox argues.\\n\\n\\\"Smartmatic insists that these phantom losses are all attributable not to the nationwide (indeed, global) coverage of the President's allegations against it, but to a handful of segments on Fox News,\\\" Fox lawyers wrote in one filing. \\\"That claim does not pass the straight-face test.\\\"\\n\\nSmartmatic, for its part, maintains that it lost contracts around the world because of false conspiracy theories pushed through channels like Fox News. But the differences between Smartmatic and Dominion do make it harder to predict the outcome of their cases, Calvert said.\\n\\n\\\"It's not necessarily a rinse and repeat situation, because they're different businesses,\\\" Calvert said. \\\"But I think it does establish a template for a potential settlement in terms of the damages.\\\"\\n\\nThe Dominion settlement helps Smartmatic\\n\\nIn Dominion's lawsuit, the election technology company calculated it lost about $88 million in lost profits from canceled contracts. From there, it extrapolated that it suffered $921 million in what are called \\\"lost enterprise\\\" damages to its business overall. Dominion also asked for hundreds of more millions to cover lost projected future profits, as well as money to fund repair to its reputation and security for its employees who suffered harassment. (Fox, before the settlement, challenged those figures).\\n\\nThere are two ways to view the $787.5 million settlement figure as a benchmark for Smartmatic, experts say.\\n\\nOne is as a 15% discount from the overall $921 million enterprise damages claim. The other is about 900% of the amount the company said it lost in profits.\\n\\nBy either metric, Smartmatic would get more money.\\n\\nIts \\\"lost enterprise\\\" calculation for its elections technology business comes out to $2.4 billion, according to the calculations in its court filings. Profits, per Smartmatic, were $690 million over five years. Either way you slice it, using those baseline numbers brings you above the $787.5 million figure Fox paid to settle Dominion's lawsuit.\\n\\n\\\"They're different numbers, they're different companies, they have different markets,\\\" Calvert said. \\\"But as long as the methodology in estimating their damages is the same, and you end up getting this portion of that amount, then I'm sure Smartmatic is saying to itself, 'That's the same thing we're going to get, as long as we follow that formula.'\\\"\\n\\nA protest outside of Fox News's New York headquarters. Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images\\n\\nSmartmatic would also likely insist on getting more money than Dominion received because they claimed more damages in the first place, pointed out Gautam Hans, a professor at Cornell Law School's First Amendment Clinic. The only question, Hans said, is how much higher the number will be.\\n\\n\\\"They have a very strong incentive to keep their prices down, and they may also want to be at a level that's close \\u2014 or at the very least, not too much higher than \\u2014 what they paid Dominion,\\\" Hans said of Fox. \\\"So I think that the real question is the strength of the case and how long Fox is willing to draw this out.\\\"\\n\\nThe fact that Dominion and Fox settled their case makes it hard to predict where things will go. It's not uncommon for parties to settle a lawsuit after a trial, agreeing on damages to ward off years of appeals. In the case between Fox and Dominion, they settled after a jury was selected but before opening arguments.\\n\\n\\\"It's hard to extrapolate from the Dominion case in part because it never got litigated,\\\" Hans said.\\n\\nGoodale, an attorney at Debevoise & Plimpton, believes Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch will view $1 billion as the benchmark \\u2014 and will try to ensure the settlement number is less than that.\\n\\n\\\"De minimus, if the two cases look alike, they're going to go for the same amount. If there's something worse in the second case, it's going to go for more,\\\" Goodale said. \\\"But I think people will be circling around that billion-dollar figure. And Murdoch won't want to pay a billion, because the headline for a billion is bad.\\\"\\n\\nFox may want to settle the lawsuit before it gets to the summary judgment phase \\u2014 when each side asks a judge to rule in its favor before going to trial.\\n\\nDominion's summary judgment filings in its lawsuit against Fox News disclosed some of the most damaging revelations about its hosts and executives.\\n\\n\\\"I would probably price in a significant increase over what Fox paid Dominion,\\\" Hans said. \\\"Would you rather pay $1 billion now and get rid of your legal fees on this case? Or are you willing to pay $1,000,000,001 in a few months and then have to pay more legal fees and also look foolish because you drew this out?\\\"\"}, {\"source_name\": \"NPR\", \"author\": \"Tamara Keith\", \"title\": \"President Biden posts 'blockbuster' three-month fundraising total: $72 million\", \"description\": \"The Biden campaign's self-reported fundraising numbers dwarf second-quarter totals for Republicans Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis.\", \"url\": \"https://www.npr.org/2023/07/14/1187702969/biden-campaign-fundraising-dnc-fec-donors\", \"text\": \"President Biden posts 'blockbuster' three-month fundraising total: $72 million\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Makela/Getty Images Mark Makela/Getty Images\\n\\nPresident Biden is starting his reelection campaign with tens of millions of dollars in the bank, dwarfing second-quarter fundraising totals already announced by the campaigns of former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\\n\\nAccording to an announcement from the campaign ahead of a Federal Elections Commission reporting deadline this weekend, the Biden-Harris campaign, Democratic National Committee and their joint fundraising committees combined to raise $72 million from April to the end of June. They have $77 million cash on hand.\\n\\nBecause Biden is the incumbent president and his campaign is fully integrated with the DNC, the combined fundraising total represents all the funds the reelect could draw upon.\\n\\nDespite higher donation limits this election cycle, these totals are actually lower than the numbers posted by former Presidents Barack Obama and Trump at a similar point in their campaigns. Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $105 million in the second quarter of 2019, while Obama and the DNC raised $86 million.\\n\\nA Biden campaign official pointed out Obama got into the race in early April in 2011, while Biden waited until late April, so on a per-day-of-campaign basis Biden raised slightly more. The official also argued that Biden isn't running against the Obama of 2011 or the Trump of 2019.\\n\\nFor Republican candidates in this cycle, there is a competitive primary, so Republican National Committee fundraising totals don't help them yet.\\n\\nEarlier this month, the Trump campaign announced the former president and his affiliated political action committee had raised more than $35 million in the second quarter.\\n\\nDeSantis' campaign said he had brought in $20 million since launching his candidacy in late June. DeSantis' super PAC, Never Back Down, says it has raised $130 million since early March. While super PACs work in support of the candidate, they can't coordinate with them.\\n\\nIn an online message shared with small-dollar donors via email and text, Biden-Harris campaign manager Julie Ch\\u00e1vez Rodr\\u00edguez touted Biden's advantage over the GOP field.\\n\\n\\\"While Republicans are burning through resources in a divisive primary focused on who can take the most extreme MAGA positions, we are significantly outraising every single one of them \\u2014 because our team's strength is our grassroots supporters,\\\" Ch\\u00e1vez Rodr\\u00edguez said.\\n\\nJoe Biden via YouTube\\n\\nMore details will be available this weekend when campaigns file detailed reports with the FEC. What they release in advance of that reporting deadline tends to accentuate the data points that the campaign wants people to focus on.\\n\\nIn the case of the Biden campaign, they point to donations coming from nearly 400,000 donors, with an average donation of $39. A lower average donation shows grassroots enthusiasm and not just the support of deep-pocketed mega-donors. At this point in 2011, the Obama reelect had donations from more than 550,000 individuals.\\n\\nThe Biden campaign says 30% of its donations this past quarter came from new donors, who didn't give Biden money in 2020.\\n\\n\\\"There's only one word: blockbuster,\\\" said Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Biden campaign co-chair, who knows a thing or two about blockbusters. He co-founded the movie studio DreamWorks and now leads WndrCo.\\n\\nKatzenberg hasn't hosted a fundraiser for Biden yet this election cycle, though he has attended several high-dollar fundraisers with the president in his role as campaign co-chair.\\n\\nAs the quarter was nearing its end, some donors expressed concern to journalists that Biden's fundraising numbers would be weak and that his events weren't well attended. In the end, though, Katzenberg told NPR that Biden raised more than $10 million in two days of attending fundraisers in San Francisco in June.\\n\\n\\\"These numbers are just, you know, they're undeniable,\\\" said Katzenberg. \\\"No one has ever raised more money faster, more diversely than President Biden.

Nauta's trial also starts on May 20.\\n\\nThe indictment alleges that Trump was personally involved in packing the classified documents as he left the White House in 2021, that he then bragged about having these secret materials and pushed his own lawyer to mislead the FBI about what he had stored at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago.\\n\\nA trial date is set. That doesn't mean it will stick\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lynne Sladky/AP Lynne Sladky/AP\\n\\nCannon cited the the extensive evidence presented in the case as one of the reasons she pushed the start date to next year.\\n\\nThis evidence includes \\\"more than 1.1 million pages of non-classified discovery produced thus far (some unknown quantity of which is described by the Government as \\\"non-content\\\"), at least nine months of camera footage (with disputes about pertinent footage), at least 1,545 pages of classified discovery ready to be produced (with more to follow), plus additional content from electronic devices and other sources yet to be turned over,\\\" Cannon wrote in her order.\\n\\nTrump and Nauta's teams have applied for a security clearance to go through the stacks of classified material ahead of the trial. This, alone could take weeks or even months to get approved \\u2014 potentially pushing back Cannon's deadline even more, said Barbara McQuade, a professor of practice at the University of Michigan Law School and a former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan.\\n\\nThe attorneys will also be limited to where they can view these records. They won't be able to view the records at their offices or whenever they want to like in an ordinary trial, McQuade noted.\\n\\n\\\"They will probably be allowed to review the classified documents only in what's called a SCIF \\u2014 a sensitive compartmented information facility \\u2014 at the courthouse or at the FBI. They'll have to make appointments to come in and review all of these documents,\\\" she said.\\n\\nPulling relevant records to show to the jury is just the discovery phase, \\\"which in most cases is a pretty straightforward process. But because of the classified nature of the evidence in this case, I think it could be a little more cumbersome and could cause more delay,\\\" she said.\\n\\nRichman was more direct: There will undoubtedly be delays in this case.\\n\\n\\\"One general rule is that trial dates, in the early stages of a case, are often placeholders and don't mean anything. It's well understood that the date set will slip. That's true in all sorts of cases and I certainly expect it to be true in this case,\\\" said Richman, a former federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\\n\\nThis case will be tried under CIPA rules. What is that?\\n\\nTrump's case will be tried within the rules of the Classified Information Procedures Act, or CIPA, a complicated statute that adds difficulties for the government's plans for a speedy trial, legal experts who spoke to NPR for this story said.\\n\\nCIPA was passed by Congress in 1980 to control the disclosure of classified information in criminal prosecutions and to prevent something called \\\"graymail.\\\" This is when a defendant threatens to release classified information, with the aim of forcing the government's hand to drop the case, Saltzburg said.\\n\\n\\\"The defense position is: Drop the case if you're not willing to make [classified documents] public,\\\" he said.\\n\\nCIPA requires the defense to notify the court of any classified evidence they want to bring up in front of a jury and to submit it as part of the public record. A judge must then decide if this classified information is admissible. Under this federal law, the government can introduce an unclassified alternative that doesn't reflect any classified information.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Department of Justice via Getty Images U.S. Department of Justice via Getty Images\\n\\n\\\"The first thing you're supposed to do is see whether you can come up with a substitute. And that is: A non-classified version of the same thing that will give the defendant a fair trial. And that's not always easy\\\" and it can take a lot of time to come up with, Saltzburg said.\\n\\nSubmitting a summary of a classified document rather than showing the actual document is one option, he said. \\\"But the defense may object to say it's not a fair picture. I'm sure there's going to be fights about it\\\" in Trump's case, Saltzburg said.\\n\\nProsecuting cases with classified documents is hard. Just look at the Oliver North case\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chris Wilkins/AFP via Getty Images Chris Wilkins/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nIf an alternative can't be found, it's possible charges against Trump could be dropped, Saltzburg said.\\n\\nThis has happened before.\\n\\nSaltzburg was part of the prosecutorial team in the criminal trial of Oliver North, who was involved in Iran-Contra affair during the 1980s.\\n\\n\\\"Everything got complicated because the North team wanted to show classified documents to the jury to suggest that he was doing what he was essentially ordered to do. And the intelligence agencies did not want those documents released,\\\" Saltzburg said.\\n\\nThat case faced lengthy delays. North went on trial for 12 criminal charges only after prosecutors dropped several charges against him.\\n\\nA 1989 New York Times article on the opening day of the North trial said, \\\"The case has been reduced somewhat in scope after the special prosecutor, Lawrence E. Walsh, dropped several important conspiracy charges against Mr. North because national secrets would have been disclosed in pressing them.\\\"\\n\\nNorth was eventually convicted on three felony charges, but those convictions were later reversed and all charges dismissed in the '90s.\\n\\nGiven these difficulties with CIPA and classified records, Saltzburg and Alan B. Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, wrote an op-ed saying they think prosecutors \\\"should withdraw all but half a dozen\\\" of Trump's 31 counts of wrongful possession of classified records.\\n\\n\\\"The fact that there were as many as 200 classified documents in unsecured locations at his home made the case more serious, but his refusals alone were sufficient reason to indict him,\\\" they wrote. \\\"Focusing on his willful refusal to return the documents can shorten the trial and serve to undercut Trump's claim of selective prosecution\\u2014 because no one else kept classified documents once the government asked for them back.\\\"\\n\\nSaltzburg and Morrison argued that the 31 counts were useful to signal how serious the charges were, but would likely slow down the pretrial process \\\"as Trump's lawyers will insist on examining each one of them and they will ask the judge for much more trial time so that they can be sure that each record was properly classified. The prosecution should attempt to see if a smaller document sample could be declassified.\\\"\\n\\nCannon's experience was questioned early on\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Senate via AP U.S. Senate via AP\\n\\nCriminal cases involving classified documents are rare, Saltzburg said. \\\"It's a very small percentage of the criminal cases that are brought throughout the entire United States. But there may be 10 or 15 of them,\\\" he said.\\n\\nThey usually come up in national security cases in Washington, D.C., and in the courts in the Eastern District of Virginia and the Southern District of New York, he said. \\\"Lawyers in those jurisdictions have a lot of experience, so do a lot of the judges, and they know how to move these cases along,\\\" he said.\\n\\nBut Trump's case is being heard in a small courtroom in Fort Pierce, Fla., by a judge with no such background.\\n\\nCannon was appointed by Trump in 2020 and listed herself as a member of the conservative Federalist Society.\\n\\nHer professional experience includes work as an assistant U.S. attorney for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida in Fort Pierce \\u2014 the same city she works out of now as a federal judge, according to the questionnaire she filled out for her judicial nomination in 2020.\\n\\nIn 2013, Cannon prosecuted 41 cases out of the Major Crimes Division, according to the Associated Press. She later handled appeal cases for criminal convictions and sentences.\\n\\nShe also worked as an associated attorney at Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher in Washington, D.C., a summer associate at Squire Sanders (now known as Squire Patton Boggs) in Miami and served in a short stint with the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division as a paralegal specialist.\\n\\nBut it's those ties to Trump as one of his appointees that has raised concern, and questions, over whether Cannon can serve as an unbiased judge in this case.\\n\\nThere were calls for Cannon to recuse herself almost immediately after she was assigned the case. But her background is pretty standard, according to Richman.\\n\\n\\\"She was in the system for quite some time, she came out of a well-respected firm, she got her name pushed forward by her local senator. And yes, she's got a Federalist background, but so do quite a few other judges,\\\" Richman said.\\n\\nMcQuade said, \\\"I think the fact that she's been appointed by Trump is not relevant. We accept the notion in this country that judges get appointed by presidents of both parties and that when they take the bench they are supposed to be independent. That's why they're appointed for life.\\\"\\n\\nMcQuade said as for Cannon's perceived lack of experience: \\\"Every judge is new at some point. Judges are randomly assigned [cases] and some are new and that's just the way it goes. Over time she will become experienced.\\\"\\n\\nCannon's early actions in this case rightfully raised some red flags, lawyers say\\n\\nCannon is the same judge who ruled in favor of Trump's request to appoint a special master to review documents seized by the FBI from Mar-a-Lago last summer. This temporarily prevented federal prosecutors from continuing their investigation into the former president's possession of classified documents. Cannon also ruled to unseal a list of items the FBI seized from their search of Trump's home.\\n\\nThis ruling sparked serious pushback from the Justice Department and some in the legal community who questioned Cannon's legal rationale in that decision.\\n\\nAnd it's criticism and serious concerns that Saltzburg, McQuade and Richman shared.\\n\\n\\\"I think people are concerned about her mostly because of the way she ruled in that search warrant matter, which was, to me really obviously wrong,\\\" McQuade said.\\n\\nCannon's decision to request that special master was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\\n\\nSaltzburg said his feelings on Cannon changed when on Friday she pushed the start date of the classified documents trial until May 2024 and issued a detailed schedule of hearings for both sides to adhere to.\\n\\n\\\"This is just what I would expect from a judge who had experience in classified information cases,\\\" he said. \\\"It is impressive and shows considerable thought. If Judge Cannon sticks by the schedule, she will have demonstrated an ability to control a complicated case.\\\"\"}, {\"source_name\": \"NPR\", \"author\": \"Carrie Johnson\", \"title\": \"DOJ won't shield Trump from claims he defamed writer E.

Jean Carroll, reversing course on one of its most controversial decisions during the early stretch of the Biden administration.\\n\\nThe department notified attorneys for Trump and Carroll of the move late Tuesday afternoon. In papers filed with a federal judge in New York, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton said DOJ determined that it \\\"lacks adequate evidence to conclude\\\" Trump was serving the federal government and acting within the scope of his employment when he denied he had sexually assaulted Carroll and made other derogatory remarks about her.\\n\\nThe change in course is a significant one. If the Justice Department had decided Trump were covered under a law called the Westfall Act, he would, in essence, have secured immunity from the civil claims. That's because federal workers are shielded from those kinds of lawsuits so long as the workers are acting within the bounds of their jobs.\\n\\nRoberta Kaplan, a lawyer for Carroll, said she was grateful for the new position from the department.\\n\\n\\\"We have always believed that Donald Trump made his defamatory statements about our client in June 2019 out of personal animus, ill will, and spite, and not as President of the United States,\\\" Kaplan said in an emailed statement. \\\"Now that one of the last obstacles has been removed, we look forward to trial in E Jean Carroll's original case in January 2024.\\\"\\n\\nLawyers for Trump had no immediate comment on the reversal.\\n\\nThe case has worked its way not only through the New York federal court system, but also the D.C. Court of Appeals. Last year, that D.C. court said the analysis under the Westfall Act required some \\\"purpose\\\" to serve the employer.\\n\\nThe Justice Department said it reviewed the court ruling, Trump's deposition, new allegations in Carroll's complaint and the jury verdict in a separate case Carroll won against Trump earlier this year. That jury took just a few hours to find Trump liable for battery and defamation, awarding Carroll millions of dollars in damages.\\n\\nAmong the factors DOJ mentioned in court papers Tuesday to explain its new position are that Trump made negative remarks about Carroll even after he left office, added fuel to the fire with new comments this year after the New York jury verdict and the alleged sexual assault \\\"was obviously not job related.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The evidence of Mr. Trump's state of mind, some of which has come to light only after the Department last made a certification decision, does not establish that he made the statements at issue with a 'more than insignificant' purpose to serve the United States Government,\\\" DOJ official Boynton wrote.\\n\\nCarroll filed the defamation lawsuit three years ago. At that time, then-Attorney General Bill Barr sided with Trump and said Trump had been acting within the bounds of his office as president. But Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected that position \\u2014 only to watch as the new Biden attorney general, Merrick Garland, also extended a legal shield to Trump.\\n\\nThe Biden Justice Department said Trump had drafted and made the negative remarks while he was in the White House, in response to questions from reporters. And DOJ pointed out that \\\"the former President was responding to allegations that could have called into question his fitness to hold the office of the Presidency.\\\"\\n\\nThe change in course adds yet another legal burden for Trump, who is fighting criminal charges over accounting for alleged hush money payments in Manhattan and separate federal charges for alleged obstruction and willful retention of highly classified documents at his Florida resort.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"NPR\", \"author\": \"David Folkenflik\", \"title\": \"Fox News hit with another defamation lawsuit \\u2014 this one over Jan. 6 allegations\", \"description\": \"Trump supporter and Jan. 6 protester Ray Epps sued the network over the allegations of former star, Tucker Carlson.

Yet Carlson never presented viewers with any concrete evidence of the claims.\\n\\n\\\"In the aftermath of the events of January 6th, Fox News searched for a scapegoat to blame other than Donald Trump or the Republican Party,\\\" the lawsuit begins. \\\"Eventually, they turned on one of their own, telling a fantastical story in which Ray Epps \\u2014 who was a Trump supporter that participated in the protests on January 6th \\u2013 was an undercover FBI agent and was responsible for the mob that violently broke into the Capitol and interfered with the peaceful transition of power for the first time in this country's history.\\\"\\n\\nOther Fox stars also picked up the call, including Laura Ingraham and Will Cain.\\n\\nFox and Carlson did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.

Fox News Network\\n\\nAttorney says Epps fled home out of fears for his family's safety\\n\\nAccording to Epps' attorney, Michael Teter, Epps and his wife were Fox viewers and Carlson fans whose lives were turned upside down by the network.\\n\\n\\\"Fox News and in particular Tucker Carlson spent a good part of two years lying about Mr. Epps's involvement in January 6th, creating a fictitious story and narrative about him that is wholly untrue,\\\" Teter tells NPR. \\\"And because of that he has faced harassment and threats from Fox viewers and others that have ruined his life.\\\"\\n\\nEpps has said he and his wife had to sell their home \\u2014 and give up their wedding business \\u2014 and move to a mobile home in Utah.\\n\\n\\\"He believed in Donald Trump and he believed the lies that Fox told,\\\" Teter says. \\\"The fact that then Fox would take one of their viewers and turn him into the villain of one of their conspiracy theories demonstrates what we've known for a while, which is Fox News does not care [about its viewers].\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It cares about making money,\\\" Teter says. \\\"And it will lie to them. It will discredit them. And ultimately it will ruin their lives if they see a profit for them to be made.\\\"\\n\\nA growing list of lawsuits against Fox News over election-related falsehoods\\n\\nEpps' suit is just the latest legal front against Fox, the result of its lurching embrace of Trump's false claims that he had been cheated of victory in the 2020 race.\\n\\nFox was the first television network to project that Democratic nominee Joe Biden would win Arizona. The call outraged many of its core viewers, who defected to other right-wing outlets.\\n\\nAs contemporaneous reporting and documents and testimony in a later court case would demonstrate, executives and stars amplified the increasingly outlandish claims in order to win back those viewers.\\n\\nThat decision proved costly and fateful to its credibility, as Fox hosts and executives agreed to air claims they knew to be false, and to its bottom line.\\n\\nFox News paid $787.5 million earlier this year to settle a defamation claim brought by a voting-technology company called Dominion Voting Systems, which was frequently placed at the center of those groundless conspiracy theories.\\n\\nPlaintiffs who sue media organizations for defamation face long odds. They must prove not only that the claims made about them were false and harmful, but that the people spreading those claims knew they were false, or should've known and recklessly disregarded the truth.\\n\\nYet Fox's settlement with Dominion, just moments before opening statements in the trial were to begin, gives others reason to hope.\\n\\n\\\"The Dominion settlement has emboldened other targets of Fox's coverage to sue, and that's not good news for Fox,\\\" says Tom Wienner, a retired corporate litigator who followed the Dominion case at NPR's request.\\n\\nEpps' suit is being heard in the same venue, Delaware Superior Court.\\n\\nFallout from a $787.5 million legal settlement\\n\\nDays after the Dominion settlement, Fox stripped Carlson of his primetime show, seeking to sideline him until his current contract ends, which is after the upcoming elections. According to Chadwick Moore, who has written a biography of Carlson, his show was to focus once more on Epps the evening that he was ousted.\\n\\nCarlson was one of the primary defendants in the Dominion suit, which showed him to be privately attacking the network's reporters for publicly contradicting Trump even though, as he acknowledged, they were correct.\\n\\n\\\"The Dominion suit... demonstrates a pattern on Fox that they have engaged in lies about the 2020 election, seeking to placate their viewers,\\\" Teter says. \\\"They wanted the frustration \\u2014 the anger \\u2014 that their viewers expected, to continue to have them watching Fox News.\\\"\\n\\nLate last month, Fox paid $12 million to settle a lawsuit from a former senior producer for Carlson who alleged his show's work environment was replete with bigotry and misogyny in her own civil suit. She had separately alleged that attorneys for the network and its parent company, Fox Corp., had pressured her to lie to defend Carlson and male executives in sworn testimony. Fox vigorously contested the allegation of misconduct by its legal team but backed down from its initial defenses of the work environment on Carlson's show.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Fox faces another lawsuit for $2.7 billion from a second voting tech company, Smartmatic. And investors have brought a pair of lawsuits, arguing that top officials and board members at Fox Corp. failed to exercise appropriate control over the network.\\n\\nFox seeks to have Epps case moved to another venue\\n\\nFox News and Fox Corp endured tough sledding in the Delaware Superior Court during the Dominion case. After months of being asked by Dominion, for example, Fox's attorneys belatedly acknowledged that Fox Corp. founder and chairman Rupert Murdoch also held the title of executive chairman of Fox News.\\n\\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis, who oversaw the Dominion case, chastised Fox's attorneys on that score and several others. And Davis has been assigned related cases. It is perhaps unsurprising that Fox's attorneys have filed a legal notice seeking to have the Epps case moved to federal court in Delaware.\\n\\nOther Fox hosts stoked the emotional fires that fueled the January 2021 protests to a greater degree than Carlson. Yet after the siege, Carlson quickly embraced a series of contradictory conspiracy theories. He argued that the brutal attack was essentially a rally that got a bit rowdy. And he also claimed that the federal government and antigovernmental protesters from Antifa instigated it.\\n\\nEpps became a touchstone in reconciling those so far baseless theories. Carlson's claims, presented on his show and in a three-part series called Patriot Purge on the Fox Nation streaming service, led to the resignations of two Fox commentators, Jonah Goldberg and Stephen Hayes. Anchor Bret Baier and then-Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace objected to top network officials. Wallace signed with CNN shortly after.\\n\\nAs recently as this March, however, Carlson once more invoked the specter of federal involvement in the attack on the Capitol.\\n\\n\\\"A lot of this was clearly influenced by federal agents or informants. It was. Ok?\\\" Carlson told viewers. \\\"But I did not want to suggest someone was a federal agent or informant unless I knew for a fact because you really could get someone in trouble.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's very clear, something very strange is going on with Ray Epps,\\\" he said. \\\"I mean, don't lie to my face.

Now, the court has denounced the practice as a form of racial discrimination that violates the 14th Amendment, which was itself enacted to enfranchise the formerly enslaved.\\n\\nThis week's affirmative action ruling was nearly as notable a departure from precedent as last year's spiking of Roe, which had been the law of the land for half a century before the court called it \\\"egregiously wrong.\\\"\\n\\nIt was a rare combination of two such far-reaching reversals, and it was accompanied by other rulings on sensitive issues by the same six justices. The combined effect has focused national attention on the court's dramatic swing to the right.\\n\\nThe most immediate explanation for the earthquake is the weight of three conservative justices appointed by former President Donald Trump and confirmed by a Republican-controlled Senate during his term. Trump was able to fill more seats in a single term than any president since Franklin Roosevelt.\\n\\nBut that is far from the whole story.\\n\\nThe current supermajority on the court exists because of major political factors that have favored Republicans in the postwar era and historic circumstances that were windows of opportunity for all six conservatives to be appointed and confirmed.\\n\\nThe Electoral College and the fortune of timing\\n\\nThe longest-serving member of the current court, Clarence Thomas, was confirmed in 1991. At the time, Republicans had won the popular vote for president in seven of the previous ten election cycles (1952 - 1988).\\n\\nBut in the eight presidential elections since then, Republicans have won the popular vote only once. Two Republicans who lost the popular vote reached the Oval Office by prevailing in the Electoral College.\\n\\nThose two \\u2014 George W. Bush and Donald Trump \\u2014 would eventually appoint the five justices who, with Thomas, make up the current 6-3 conservative supermajority.\\n\\nThe biggest contributor on this score was Trump's 2016 win in the Electoral College against Hillary Clinton. George W. Bush also came to the presidency initially via the Electoral College after losing the popular vote to Al Gore in 2000. (Bush did win the popular vote in his reelection year, before he appointed any justices.)\\n\\nRepublicans have also had far more luck in having Supreme Court vacancies occur when they controlled the White House and a working majority in the Senate.\\n\\nWhile the presidency itself has swung between the two parties with some regularity since World War II, with Republicans holding the office for 40 years and Democrats for 38, no Democratic president in all those decades has been able to appoint and confirm a chief justice. By contrast, four of the six Republican presidents in that same period \\u2014 Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush \\u2014 have named a chief justice.\\n\\nOverall, in the 54 years since Nixon first took office, there have been 20 confirmed appointments to the court, counting chiefs and associate justices. Republican presidents have had 15 of them, Democratic presidents just five.\\n\\nCentrists as an endangered species\\n\\nThroughout its history the Supreme Court has made momentous political decisions, driven at times by strong ideological leanings. But it has also had a tradition of idealizing a nonpartisan consensus and seeking unanimity whenever possible. It is a tradition the current chief justice often salutes and, at least at times, seems eager to serve.\\n\\nIn the past, as a rule, the Senate defaulted to confirming nominees in deference to the president \\u2014 even across party lines. If there was not an egregious issue or personal matter, the vote was often lopsided. Reagan appointee Antonin Scalia, a true conservative icon, was confirmed in 1986 without a dissenting vote.\\n\\nMoreover, individual justices at times seemed to evolve in their views and alliances during their time on the court, sometimes frustrating the president who appointed them or elements of his party.\\n\\nFor example, when Thomas was appointed in 1991, seven other sitting justices had been appointed by Republicans, and an eighth was appointed by a Democrat but had a conservative record. Yet for all its party unity, the court of that time was not regarded as particularly conservative. Two of its members would come to be viewed as part of its \\\"liberal wing\\\" (David Souter and John Paul Stevens), two Reagan appointees were regarded as moderates or centrists (Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy) and a fifth, Harry Blackmun, had been the author of Roe v. Wade.\\n\\nBut change was already underway to nominate justices who would more reliably keep a conservative bent.\\n\\ntoggle caption J. David Ake/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nThe highly partisan battle over Reagan appointee Robert Bork, whom the Senate rejected in 1987 after liberals blasted his record, had poisoned the well.\\n\\nThomas had an ideological profile much akin to Bork's, but he was confirmed in part because he declined to state opinions about controversial issues.\\n\\nHis hearing was not without controversy, however. Thomas faced accusations of sexual harassment by a former co-worker named Anita Hill. Thomas \\u2014 who is Black and was nominated to fill the vacancy left by Thurgood Marshall, the only African American ever to serve on the court at the time \\u2014 called Hill's televised testimony \\\"a high-tech lynching for uppity Blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves.\\\"\\n\\nThomas' nomination was confirmed by the full Senate 52 to 48, saved by the votes of 11 Democrats unwilling to oppose him.\\n\\nCampus organization seizes power: The Federalist Society\\n\\nBack in 1991, Thomas was the first new justice on the court who had been associated with the Federalist Society, a campus gathering of conservative law students and faculty at Yale, the University of Chicago and other schools. Rising up in the wake of Roe, the group was formally founded in 1982.\\n\\nPolitics What Is The Federalist Society And How Does It Affect Supreme Court Picks? (2018) What Is The Federalist Society And How Does It Affect Supreme Court Picks? Listen \\u00b7 4:14 4:14\\n\\nTheir animating idea was that federal judges were arrogating too much power to themselves and playing fast and loose with the Constitution to accommodate their own policy preferences. Many of the rulings of the Supreme Court under Chief Warren Burger and his predecessor Earl Warren were regarded as egregious examples of \\\"activist judges\\\" run amok.\\n\\nSince then, the Society has grown and prospered in numbers, influence and fundraising prowess. Succeeding perhaps beyond its dreams, it now counts the six conservative members of the Supreme Court among its current or former members. It has had no small role in their elevation, aggressively recruiting and promoting candidates for the bench and supporting conservative Republican candidates for president.\\n\\nThe current court's conservative majority is now often seen as a Federalist Society majority.\\n\\nThe breakthrough year of 2005\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul J. Richards/AFP via Getty Images Paul J. Richards/AFP via Getty Images\\n\\nSignificant as it was to see the first President Bush nominate Thomas, the real breakthrough for movement conservatives in legal circles came in 2005. The circumstances were unique and highly personal.\\n\\nO'Connor, who in 1982 became the first woman to join the court, decided to retire a bit early to spend more time with her husband, who was ill. She announced her retirement in 2005, and the just-reelected President W. Bush named John Roberts, a former Reagan adviser who had become a federal appeals court judge, to replace her. Roberts had been a Harvard undergrad and law student and had a reputation as a high-powered intellect.\\n\\nBut before Roberts could be confirmed, the court's senior-most member, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, died. So Bush withdrew his nomination for the O'Connor seat and put him up for chief instead in September 2005. Roberts' hearings began a week later, and he was confirmed in time for the court's traditional opening on the first Monday of October.\\n\\nThe Roberts hearings were largely non-contentious. Only minor controversies had arisen concerning Roberts' career, and he handled questions about his views with aplomb, referring to the court's task as that of an \\\"umpire calling balls and strikes.\\\"\\n\\nThe O'Connor vacancy was to be filled by Bush's White House counsel, Harriet Miers, a Texan and a longtime associate of the Bush family. It seemed appropriate to replace O'Connor with another woman, and while Miers had not been a judge and was little known in the legal community, she had the support of some prominent Democrats in the Senate.\\n\\nThe problem arose on the other side, as a number of prominent conservatives denounced the choice. Bork called it a \\\"disaster\\\" and a \\\"slap in the face\\\" to the conservative movement that had been \\\"building up ... for the last 20 years,\\\" a reference to the Federalist Society. The movement conservatives did not trust Miers to toe their line, as she did not have a history of ruling in the cases they cared most about.\\n\\nAs president of the Texas State Bar, she had supported an affirmative action program for women and minorities. The critics feared \\\"another Souter,\\\" a reference to the first justice chosen by the first President Bush. The opposition grew loud enough that Miers chose to withdraw her name from candidacy.\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\\n\\nAt that point, Bush called on a prospect he had first interviewed years earlier for an appellate court position, Samuel Alito, who had actually been at Yale with Thomas in the 1970s. While he satisfied Miers' detractors, Alito also stirred the opposition party to action. Although Democrats had only 44 lawmakers in the Senate that fall, they had enough votes to mount a filibuster if they chose to, and there were Republicans willing to at least consider voting no.\\n\\nAmong those withholding commitments on Alito was a first-year senator from Illinois who had been a Harvard law student and a law professor at Chicago. His name was Barack Obama, and he declared himself \\\"concerned that President Bush has wasted an opportunity to appoint a consensus nominee in the mold of [O'Connor] and has instead made a selection to appease the far right-wing of the Republican Party.\\\"\\n\\nSen. Edward Kennedy, a senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, interviewed Alito and took careful notes for his diary (later shared with biographer John A. Farrell). Kennedy asked Alito about Roe and recorded this as his answer: \\\"I am a believer in precedents, people would find I adhere to that.\\\" But Kennedy was not convinced.\\n\\nKennedy had also written in his diary that he found Roberts \\\"bright and smart and compelling,\\\" but that when he sought Roberts' commitments on social justice issues, Roberts \\\"didn't want to get into that at all.\\\" Kennedy would eventually vote against both the Bush nominees.\\n\\nEighteen years later, it was Roberts who signed the opinion that erased affirmative action in college admissions this week.\\n\\nConfirmation drama returns\\n\\nThe Alito hearings began the first week of January 2006, in an atmosphere of tension. Confirming Roberts to the Rehnquist vacancy was one thing, but Alito was taking the place of O'Connor, who had been a vote for moderation on abortion and racial gerrymandering and other issues.\\n\\nThe Democratic leader at the time and some of the chamber's liberals were ready to filibuster, protesting the choice of a candidate as ideological as they believed Alito to be.\\n\\nThe questions in the hearing room were tough. Alito had denied being a member of a certain alumni group that wanted fewer women and minorities admitted to Princeton, but evidence emerged that he had cited such a membership in the past. The questioning grew more hostile. There was talk of a subpoena for records of the group.\\n\\nOn the third day, one of the Republicans on the committee, Lindsey Graham, praised Alito and regretted what the nominee was enduring. Alito's wife, Martha-Ann Bomgardner, began to cry and left the room in tears after Graham sarcastically had asked Alito: \\\"Are you really a closet bigot?\\\" She later returned, composed and holding her husband's hand. But the image of her looking distraught became the focus of the day's proceeding in the media.\\n\\nAfter that, the mood in the hearing room was palpably different, and the steam soon went out of the filibuster talk. Years later, as a president seeking support for his own court nominees, Obama would say he regretted entertaining the idea of a filibuster against Alito.\\n\\nAt the time, Democrats were increasingly focused on that fall's election, one in which they hoped to recapture the Senate majority. So the filibuster did not happen. Later that month, with just one Republican breaking ranks against him and four Democrats in favor, Alito was confirmed 58-42.\\n\\nLast year, Alito wrote the decision in the Dobbs case that overturned Roe.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"NPR\", \"author\": \"Suzanne Nuyen\", \"title\": \"Up First briefing: Meta's free AI; Trump's legal troubles; a scary fish's teeth\", \"description\": \"Facebook's parent company has released its newest AI for free.

Many decide to wait because the new rules make gaining asylum much harder if they cross the border illegally.\\n\\nImmigrant advocates say the app can't be the only way to access asylum, as it creates a bottleneck, according to NPR's Joel Rose.

Now, the curtain is falling.\\n\\nThis news arrived to us, as so much news about Rivera does, via Rivera himself, thanks to an interview with The Associated Press, and a stream of Tweets in which he ruminates on his career, exults in praise, responds to insults, and, of course, provides an obligatory shirtless selfie.\\n\\nThat one, from last Friday, was entitled simply \\\"80 year old contemplating retirement.\\\" For the record, Rivera, who routinely goes out of his way to proclaim his patriotism and to metaphorically wrap himself in the American flag, will turn 80 on July 4th.\\n\\nHe had earlier announced that Thursday and Friday would be his final appearances on The Five, the top-rated show on cable news with no real competition since Fox canceled star Tucker Carlson's program, as Rivera contemplated what role he could hold at the network. That's not in the cards now.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not going to be on The Five. I've been fired from The Five, and as a result of that, I quit Fox,\\\" Rivera tweeted in a video he posted from Jones Beach Inlet, as he made his way to Manhattan by boat, his gray hair and mustache fluttering in the sea breeze.\\n\\n\\\"We reached an amicable conclusion with Geraldo over the past few weeks and look forward to celebrating him on Fox & Friends, which will be his last appearance on the network,\\\" Fox said in a statement released by a spokesperson Thursday night.\\n\\nRivera's Friday appearance on the network's morning show came after lengthy discourse mocking President Biden's appearance on MSNBC and Hunter Biden's scandals, and a brief performance from Skillet, a Christian hard rock group. Rivera didn't sugarcoat his departure, saying he had been fired by Fox from The Five and reiterating that he had quit. The network then ran a lengthy video tribute to his five decades in television.\\n\\nHe proclaimed himself \\\"touched.\\\"\\n\\nA history of head-turning decisions, all playing out on TV\\n\\nAs a journalist who has covered the media, and Rivera, since 2000, I must confess to watching all this with no small interest.\\n\\nRivera, a muckraking local television news journalist turned network star at ABC News and CNBC, proved to be an award-winning and self-promoting sensation. He built up his own brand decades before the word \\\"influencer\\\" had been coined, talking network executives into primetime specials and daytime talk shows filled with stories of scandal and dysfunction.\\n\\nHe memorably opened up the legendary gangster Al Capone's vault on live TV to reveal... nothing. And he famously had his nose broken by a chair flung his way during a brawl between neo-Nazis and a Black civil rights activist that erupted on his tabloid TV talk show Geraldo. He unfairly questioned the military recognitions of a Democratic U.S. representative who called for President Bill Clinton's resignation after the disclosure Clinton had lied under oath about an affair. (Two decades later, Rivera would threaten those who would impeach then President Donald Trump in 2019 that they would have to \\\"come through\\\" him.)\\n\\nThis was all a long time ago. In the many years since, however, Rivera has relied on his single-name status to sell himself. \\\"There's just me and Oprah,\\\" he occasionally told executives.\\n\\nAfter the September 2001 terror attacks, Rivera turned to his former boss at CNBC, Roger Ailes, who went on to lead Fox News. Rivera begged for a chance to cover the looming invasions of Afghanistan (and then, as it turned out, Iraq) for Fox News. Ailes signed him up.\\n\\nRivera managed to make the war on al-Qaida about him. About whether he had really spotted Osama bin Laden in the hills of Tora Bora. About his stridently jingoistic tone, given he was ostensibly there as a reporter, not a pundit. About whether he was personally being shot at by al-Qaida snipers. About his decision to carry a gun in a war zone \\u2014 a move that can endanger other journalists covering war, as it makes them far more likely to be viewed as combatants by either or both sides.\\n\\nPraying on not-so-very \\\"hallowed ground\\\"\\n\\nAnd then there was his decision to broadcast footage of himself reciting the Lord's Prayer over the site where he reported a U.S. bombing raid had killed three U.S. service members along with numerous Afghan allies.\\n\\n\\\"We walked over what I consider hallowed ground today. We walked over the spot where the friendly fire took so many of our, our men, and the mujahideen yesterday,\\\" he told viewers.\\n\\nHallowed that ground may have been \\u2013 but it was separated by hundreds of miles of difficult-to-navigate terrain from the spot in Kandahar Province where the fighters were actually killed. He rebroadcast the claims on Fox 12 hours later. A Fox colleague handed me the raw videotape in a suburban parking lot so I could review both treatments. (Remember, this was more than two decades ago.)\\n\\nWhen called on the flagrant discrepancy, Rivera explained it as an innocent mistake made in the \\\"fog of war.\\\"\\n\\nJournalists in Tora Bora for MSNBC and CNN told me they knew the location of the deadly incident within minutes thanks to satellite phone connections to colleagues in New York and elsewhere.\\n\\nIn our interview before my story ran, Rivera yelled at me, questioned my credentials, and recited his career highlights. And yet he paused to offer the most clear-cut self-analysis that I've ever heard a broadcast journalist give on the record.\\n\\n\\\"There's been an aspect of boosterism that I would cop to,\\\" he told me. \\\"I clearly have indulged in, not the Geraldo of syndicated [daytime television] days, but a more impassioned presentation.\\\"\\n\\nFox stood by Rivera, never broadcasting a correction, instead merely saying he made \\\"an honest mistake.\\\"\\n\\nNonetheless, Rivera spent years coming after me. He sought to convince my bosses to retract the stories, comparing me to Janet Cooke, the reporter for the Washington Post who had to give back a Pulitzer Prize after it was revealed she made up her story. He told a reporter he wanted to break my nose. (Never did.) He told Jay Leno on the Tonight Show that I had penis envy. He spent a year fruitlessly trying to get an award bestowed to me revoked. The uproar that ensued from my coverage was, he told the Atlantic, \\\"the most grievous wound.\\\"\\n\\nHe once called me \\\"a really weak-kneed, backstabbing, sweaty-palmed reporter.\\\" I have deployed that for many years as the start to my official NPR biography. Naturally, I have a wall in my study filled with Geraldo editorial cartoons. I suspect he and I have that in common.\\n\\nLater, Rivera devoted a significant portion of his memoir about his Fox years to the incident, saying I had caused a scandal to hang over him for decades. The book is titled - what else? - The Geraldo Show.\\n\\nAn unlikely voice of reason at Fox News\\n\\nHis role at Fox dissipated as the years passed. His show Geraldo at Large gave way to his co-hosting role at The Five, a show expressly designed to be ego-proof, as it featured a cadre of rotating hosts.\\n\\nOn The Five, Rivera played the liberal treading water in a sea of conservatives. The assignment represented Fox's philosophy of balance: The putative lefty was a longtime registered Republican who weighed running for Senate in that party from two states, New Jersey and Ohio. A former contestant on Trump's Celebrity Apprentice, he also supported Trump politically for years, defining himself as a friend. He only broke with Trump after the then-president refused to accept Joe Biden's win in 2020.\\n\\nNonetheless, he often has been of late an unlikely voice of reason, reminding his conservative colleagues of factual objections to baseless or extreme claims they've made. He's sought to counter baseless assertions about immigrants and the pandemic and other heated topics on the show.\\n\\nRivera says his verbal tussles on the air and on social media with co-host Greg Gutfeld contributed to Fox's decision to drop him from the show. (Gutfeld has been promoted to be host of the network's key 10 p.m. weeknight time slot.) Fox hasn't commented on that claim.\\n\\nA telling coda to the Geraldo Show\\n\\nAs for Rivera himself: here's a perhaps telling coda to the Tora Bora debacle:\\n\\nWhen his Fox memoir was published a few years ago, I received an invitation to the book party at a large bar at a restaurant frequented by Fox News staffers. It was just across the street from the network's headquarters in midtown Manhattan.\\n\\nI asked his publicist whether he was aware of our history. The invitation was extended, nonetheless.\\n\\nI ducked into the party after work (Fox is only a few blocks from NPR's New York bureau, where I am based). Geraldo was standing far away, at the head of a long line of well-wishers seeking their books to be signed. I walked down a corridor to get a drink at the bar which, as luck had it, stood just a few feet from an archway where he was holding court.\\n\\nI waited for a student to wrap up chatting with the evening's star, and then introduced myself, congratulating Rivera for the publication of his memoir. He asked if I had read it. I said I had. He asked again, saying, 'Yeah, but the parts about you?' I said I had. He smiled and inquired what I thought of it.\\n\\nI told him that it was his night, and I was there to say hello, not to step on his moment. But if he wanted to learn what I thought, I said, I'd be happy to take him out for a coffee or a beer.\\n\\nHe roared appreciatively and thanked me for stopping in.\\n\\nAs in so many ways, the Geraldo show was for show. I would have been happy to get that drink. We haven't.

Here's why\\n\\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Fred Hayes/Getty Images for Angel Studios Fred Hayes/Getty Images for Angel Studios\\n\\nSound of Freedom, a Christian thriller about a former federal agent rescuing children from exploitation, is this summer's surprise box office hit. Made for about $15 million, it earned almost as much on its release day as the final installment of Indiana Jones and has raked in more than $85 million since opening earlier this month.\\n\\nBut the movie is also being criticized as a vehicle for conspiracy theories and misleading depictions of human trafficking \\u2014 landing it in the middle of the country's politically polarized culture wars.\\n\\nThe film, based on a real-life, controversial anti-trafficking activist, is being heavily promoted in conservative media. Former President Donald Trump is hosting a screening on Wednesday at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J .\\n\\nA big part of its success is an appeal from its star, Jim Caviezel, who comes on screen at the end urging viewers to buy more tickets so other people can see it and help end child trafficking. It's a model distributor Angel Studios calls \\\"pay it forward.\\\"\\n\\nCaviezel, who previously played Jesus Christ in Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, is also drawing attention to the film in other ways. For years, he's been a prominent promoter of the false, violent QAnon conspiracy theory \\u2014 specifically, the baseless claim that an international cabal of elites is abusing and killing children to extract a substance called adrenochrome.\\n\\nThese wild claims have become deeply enmeshed with narratives about child trafficking in recent years, from the QAnon predecessor Pizzagate conspiracy theory, which falsely alleged a pizza parlor in Washington, D.C., was home to a child sex ring, to false claims that online retailer Wayfair was selling children in the guise of furniture.\\n\\nIn press appearances promoting Sound of Freedom, Caviezel continues to spout QAnon falsehoods. On a recent episode of former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's podcast, Caviezel claimed \\\"the whole adrenochrome empire\\\" is driving demand for trafficked children. \\\"It's an elite drug that they've used for many years,\\\" he asserted, falsely claiming it is \\\"10 times more potent than heroin\\\" and \\\"has some mystical qualities as far as making you look younger.\\\"\\n\\nDespite Caviezel's comments, Sound of Freedom itself doesn't contain any references to adrenochrome or other conspiracy theories. It was actually filmed before QAnon conspiracy theories became a widespread phenomenon.\\n\\nExecutives at Angel Studios, the film's distributor, have publicly rejected any association with conspiracies. So have Tim Ballard, the former federal agent Caviezel plays in the movie, and his organization, Operation Underground Railroad. (Angel Studios declined NPR's interview request. Operation Underground Railroad did not respond to NPR's questions.)\\n\\nBut Ballard recently told right-wing podcadster Jordan Peterson that claimed adrenochrome harvesting is real. His statements, and Caviezel's, have an impact on how Sound of Freedom is being received, said Mike Rothschild, author of The Storm Is Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement, Cult, and Conspiracy Theory of Everything.\\n\\n\\\"It's being marketed to QAnon believers, it's being embraced by this community and its leading actor is a huge part of the QAnon community,\\\" he said.\\n\\nIndeed, QAnon adherents have eagerly anticipated its release and greeted the film as a way to bring new believers into the fold. \\\"New to Q? With the 'Sound of Freedom' movie dominating the box office and giving Hollywood seizures, we have a lot of new eyes on us!\\\" read the title of one popular thread on a QAnon website last week.\\n\\nIn addition to the controversies around QAnon, the rescue story told in Sound of Freedom has also become a lightning rod.\\n\\nMany of the missions Operation Underground Railroad describes are hard to verify or contain significant misrepresentations, according to extensive reporting by Tim Marchman and Anna Merlan of Vice News.\\n\\n\\\"They're not whole cloth falsehoods, but they reassemble things that are true or close to being true into stories that are just wildly and completely different from what actually happened,\\\" Marchman said.\\n\\nOperation Underground Railroad has denied Vice's findings. (Ballard recently left the group.)\\n\\nOn screen, Sound of Freedom goes even further in fictionalizing Ballard's story, showing him single-handedly taking on a crime syndicate in Colombia.\\n\\nThese popular depictions raise concerns among anti-trafficking experts, who say they offer an incomplete portrait of a real and urgent problem.\\n\\n\\\"Because trafficking is so varied and does span so many populations, it really tests our brain to not, not distill it down to some sort of 'this is what a common victim of human trafficking looks like,'\\\" said Elizabeth Campbell, co-director of the University of Michigan's Human Trafficking Clinic. \\\"By doing that, I think we make actual victims of human trafficking more invisible and more vulnerable to exploitation.\\\"\\n\\nShe said trafficking takes many forms, including forced labor, which is often under-reported, and affects victims of a wide range of ages. Some trafficking involves kidnapping by strangers, as depicted in Sound of Freedom, but often it's committed by people close to the victim who exploit trust, she said.\\n\\nIn a long blog post about the film, Angel Studios acknowledged some elements are fictionalized and said the film takes \\\"creative liberties in depicting the different methods of child trafficking.\\\"\\n\\nCampbell worries the picture of trafficking and how to address it presented by Operation Underground Railroad and, by extension, Sound of Freedom, diverts people's attention, resources and policy proposals away from where they're most needed.\\n\\n\\\"It becomes easy for people to say, 'Well, if I just spread a message that we need to support law enforcement in freeing these child victims,' they don't have to do the hard work of asking what role they play in the purchasing of goods for forced labor, or they don't have to play the hard role of figuring out how do we reduce poverty and the sort of inherent vulnerability that comes with poverty that leads to this kind of exploitation,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Those difficult questions are never asked because we're just sort of saying, 'Well, the best thing you can do is support this particular group in this one particular action against these particular bad guys.'\\\"\"}, {\"source_name\": \"NPR\", \"author\": \"Emily Olson\", \"title\": \"How Jason

glorified gun violence and conveyed traditionally racist ideas.\\n\\nA CMT spokesperson confirmed the move to NPR on Thursday, but offered no comment on the reasoning.\\n\\nSince the video's release on Friday, it's emerged as a familiar kind of political litmus test, with interpretations of its message often falling along voting divides.\\n\\nHere's an overview of the situation:\\n\\nWhat is \\\"Try That in a Small Town\\\" about?\\n\\nAldean, a 46-year-old country singer from Macon, Ga., first released the song in May, but it wasn't until the release of the video on July 14 \\u2014 as promotion for his 11th upcoming album \\u2014 that the discourse ratcheted up.\\n\\nIn a statement released alongside the video, Aldean said the song represents an \\\"unspoken rule\\\" for those raised in small towns: \\\"We all have each other's backs and we look out for each other.\\\" The singer is not credited as a writer for the song, as has been the case for most of his 27 hit singles.\\n\\nThreats to outsiders (and the implication those outsiders are from cities) are present throughout the song's lyrics, which begin with a list of crimes that might happen in urban settings (\\\"Sucker punch somebody on a sidewalk / carjack an old lady at a red light\\\") then crescendo into the titular chorus:\\n\\n\\\"Well, try that in a small town / See how far you make it down the road / Around here we take care of our own / You cross that line, it won't take long / For you to find out, I recommend you don't.\\\"\\n\\nAldean ups the vigilante ante by bridging the second chorus with a reference to gun rights, singing:\\n\\n\\\"I've got a gun that my granddad gave me / they say one day they're gonna round up. / Well that s*** might fly in the city / good luck / Try that in a small town\\\".\\n\\nWhy is the video so divisive?\\n\\nInterspersed between shots of Aldean singing are clips of vandalizing, riots and police encounters, much of which is evocative of racial injustice protests.\\n\\nSome of the scenes bear a Fox News chyron, but others, as some TikTok sleuths have pointed out, appear to be stock footage, in some cases of gatherings from other countries.\\n\\nBut much of the criticism around the video has less to do with these clips than its setting: The Maury County Courthouse building in Columbia, Tenn., which serves as an American-flag-draped backdrop for Aldean and his band.\\n\\nThe landmark was the site of race riots in 1946 as well as a 1927 lynching in which a white mob pulled an 18-year-old black man, Henry Choate, from jail and dragged him through the city by car, according to several media reports, including one detailed account from The Washington Post.\\n\\nChoate had allegedly confessed to attacking a 16-year-old white girl \\\"to protect his life,\\\" even though the girl \\\"could not positively identify him as the assailant,\\\" the Post reported.\\n\\nWhat is Aldean saying?\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Aldean pushed back hard against accusations he was \\\"pro-lynching,\\\" saying such an interpretation \\\"goes too far\\\" and is \\\"dangerous.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it,\\\" he wrote on Twitter. \\\"Try That In A Small Town, for me, refers to the feeling of a community that I had growing up, where we took care of our neighbors, regardless of differences of background or belief.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"NO ONE, including me, wants to continue to see senseless headlines or families ripped apart,\\\" he wrote.\\n\\nThe production company behind the videos, TackleBox, also defended the video's location as a popular filming spot, telling Entertainment Tonight that any \\\"alternative narrative\\\" about the reasons it was chosen were false.\\n\\nAldean has received five Grammy Award nominations (including two for Best Country Album) for his two decades of music depicting rural, blue-collar life. And throughout that success, he's rarely shied away from sharing his right-leaning political views.\\n\\nHis wife, Brittany Aldean, and his sister, Kasi Rosa Wicks, launched a conservative clothing line dedicated to trolling liberals. Aldean defended dressing his children in anti-Joe-Biden attire and himself for wearing blackface as part of a 2015 Halloween costume. He was spotted golfing alongside Donald Trump and delivered an impromptu performance at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort.\\n\\nBut, at other times, the singer has tried to walk a more nuanced line toward politics, perhaps most memorably after surviving the 2017 mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival.\\n\\nAldean was performing on stage as the night's closing act when the shooting began. Six months later, he tiptoed through the refreshed gun control debate, saying in an interview that tragedies shouldn't be used as fodder for political arguments, but ultimately agreed that it was \\\"too easy to get guns\\\" in the U.S..\\n\\nHow are other people reacting?\\n\\nGun control advocates are among the song's loudest critics, saying \\\"Try That in a Small Town\\\" glorifies a dangerous eye-for-an eye ethos.\\n\\nShannon Watts, founder of the group Moms Demand Action, called it an \\\"ode to a sundown town\\\" that suggested \\\"people be beaten or shot for expressing free speech.\\\"\\n\\nOthers said the song's hints at violence were clearly racial dog whistles, zeroing in on the song's portrayal of protests like flag-burning. Tennessee state Rep. Justin Jones, a Democrat, summed it as a \\\"heinous song calling for racist violence.\\\"\\n\\nSheryl Crow and Margo Price are among the musicians who've spoke out against the song. But others, like Travis Tritt and Blanco Brown described the reaction as unfair social commentary.\\n\\nPolitical commentators on the right have have held up the country music canon, and Aldean in particular, as a loudspeaker for under-appreciated conservative values.\\n\\n2024 GOP primary contenders like Trump, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis all defended the artist, with DeSantis saying: \\\"When the media attacks you, you're doing something right.\\\"\\n\\nIf attention was his goal, then Aldean might agree: As of midday Thursday, \\\"Try That in a Small Town\\\" was ranked No. 1 in the U.S. on iTunes and was holding the No. 2 spot on YouTube's trending music videos.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"NPR\", \"author\": \"John Otis\", \"title\": \"All the prison's presidents: Peru's special jail for ex-leaders is all full up\", \"description\": \"In Peru, so many former leaders have been accused of crimes that the country has designated a small prison specifically to house them.

Due to violence and overcrowding at Peru's standard prisons, part of the police compound has been converted into a kind of VIP jail with three custom-built cells that are more like small apartment units.\\n\\nBarbadillo's first inmate, former President Alberto Fujimori, arrived in 2007. He is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses.\\n\\nFormer President Pedro Castillo arrived last December after he was arrested for trying to dissolve congress and rule by decree. Alejandro Toledo, who faces charges of money laundering from his time as president in the early 2000s, arrived at the prison in April.\\n\\nFrom France to Brazil to South Korea, many countries have prosecuted and jailed former presidents, while in the United States, former President Donald Trump could be sent to prison if convicted of mishandling classified documents after he left the White House. But Peru may hold the record for the most ex-leaders behind bars at one time, according to Rosa Mar\\u00eda Palacios, a Lima lawyer and political commentator.\\n\\n\\\"In Latin America, people envy us,\\\" she says. \\\"Many people abroad say: 'At least you get them in jail.'\\\"\\n\\ntoggle caption John Otis for NPR\\n\\nBut Palacios also sees the Barbadillo prison as a troubling symbol of Peru's endemic corruption and political upheaval. So many presidents have resigned, been impeached or tossed in jail that the Peru's current leader, Dina Boluarte, is Peru seventh president in the past six years.\\n\\nLatin America In Peru, President Boluarte's government is blamed for human rights abuses In Peru, President Boluarte's government is blamed for human rights abuses Listen \\u00b7 4:43 4:43\\n\\n\\\"It's not a stable situation,\\\" Palacios says.\\n\\nNearly every Peruvian president over the past three decades has been accused of corruption. In most of these cases, they became entangled in a wide-ranging scandal involving Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction firm that admitted to paying $800 million in kickbacks to politicians across Latin American in exchange for public works contracts.\\n\\nIn fact, the only reason there was room at Barbadillo when former President Toledo arrived in April is because another former president, Ollanta Humala \\u2014 who had spent 18 months of pre-trial detention there \\u2014 had been released, freeing up one of the three cells. Both former presidents face charges related to the Odebrecht scandal.\\n\\nFueling the volatility is growing political polarization in Peru where, in the 2021 presidential election, losing candidate Keiko Fujimori refused to accept the results and made baseless claims of fraud. Meanwhile, Peru's 1993 Constitution makes it easy for president to close down congress, but it also allows congress to impeach presidents on ambiguous grounds.\\n\\nThe result, says Peruvian historian Antonio Zapata, \\\"is a fight to the death between the different branches of power with no clear rules. The rules should be in the constitution but they're not.\\\"\\n\\nOne president on the losing end of this equation was Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. He was elected in 2016 but was forced out of office 19 months later by the opposition-controlled congress that accused him of \\\"moral incapacity\\\" which, according to Zapata, could mean almost just about anything.\\n\\nKuczynski has also been linked to the Odebrecht scandal. But the allegations against him were dredged up from the early 2000s when Kuczynski was Peru's finance minister. Instead of going to Barbadillo, Kuczynski spent three years under house arrest and has yet to go to trial.\\n\\n\\\"I'm still defending myself,\\\" he told NPR in an interview at his home. But he added: \\\"The important point, more than what happened to me, is what happened to Peru.\\\"\\n\\nIndeed, the ouster of Kuczynski sparked years of turmoil. His successor as president, Martin Vizcarra, was forced out, quickly reinstated, then forced out of office again. A subsequent president, Manuel Merino, served less than a week. Another, Mercedes Ara\\u00f3z, lasted for a single day.\\n\\nMuch of the upheaval came as Peru was dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic that brought a surge of poverty. Lima economist Carolina Trivelli said constantly changing presidential administrations makes it harder to carry out health, education, public works and other government-run programs.\\n\\n\\\"This affects all Peruvians, the rich and the poor alike,\\\" she says.\\n\\ntoggle caption John Otis for NPR\\n\\nBack at Barbadillo prison on a recent morning, about a dozen die-hard supporters of former President Castillo stood at the front gate demanding his freedom.

We take a look at the very best of her songwriting sorcery\", \"url\": \"https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-best-stevie-nicks-solo-songs\", \"text\": \"A sizeable percentage of Stevie Nicks' best songs may have been released under the banner of Fleetwood Mac - the band that undoubtedly put her on the international map - but while enjoying the trappings of success as one fifth of the soft rock superstar act, the Phoenix, Arizona-born vocalist also established herself as a prolific and ground-breaking solo artist, proving that she could not only stand on her own two feet, but fly high without the help of her bandmates.\\n\\nHaving cemented herself as an unmistakable icon - being the only woman to be inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame twice - Nicks' work is celebrated for its complex and often beautiful untanglings of love and emotion, and of course, its otherworldly and enchanting mystique, straight from her own witchy and wild heart.\\n\\nFrom cocaine-addled '80s dance floor-fillers to bluesy ballads, these are the ten best songs of Stevie Nicks' solo career:\\n\\n1. Rooms On Fire - The Other Side Of The Mirror (1989)\\n\\nA bewitching track conceived from the fittingly ethereal surroundings of a mountain-top Dutch castle located in Beverly Hills, with Nicks turning to its 16th-century architecture, whimsy lavishness and antique artworks for inspiration. At the centre of it all however, was her intense new infatuation with producer Rupert Hine, who was part of her \\\"spiritual agreement\\\" to create a \\\"magic album\\\". Swathed in heady, rich romance, Rooms On Fire burns with an obsessive fervour about a fairytale meeting; the mysterious sixth sense that engulfs the room in metaphorical flames whenever that special someone walks nearby. Its music video was also filmed within the castle's walls, and is a gorgeously gothic fever dream.\\n\\n2. Think About It - Bella Donna (1981)\\n\\nOriginally written for the Rumours album, Think About It was born from the most explosive period of Fleetwood Mac\\u2019s history. At the time, keyboardist/songwriter Christine McVie was in the midst of a divorce with bassist John, and Nicks\\u2019 relationship with then-boyfriend Buckingham was on its final legs; neither woman wanted to be in the band with their ex-partners. The track was the co-frontwoman\\u2019s ode of encouragement to them both, to keep going and focus on their love of creating music, rather than the relationships they were leaving behind; they could, and would, stay with Fleetwood Mac. A song of succour for times of hardship, with bittersweet lyrics and an uplifting melody that's as comforting as a blanket around the shoulders, and a heartfelt conversation shared with an old friend.\\n\\n3. Stop Draggin' My Heart Around - Bella Donna (1981)\\n\\nNicks' debut Bella Donna may have reached the top of the charts, but before its release, producer Jimmy Iovine was concerned that the record didn't contain a hit single, and suggested that Nicks link up with Tom Petty to work on Stop Draggin' My Heart Around, a track originally reserved for the band's 1981 album Hard Promises, as the introduction to her album.\\n\\n\\n\\nRegardless of the writing credit, Nicks owns the song, her throaty purr blending seamlessly with Petty's smoother higher-pitched croon, as bluesy organs vamp around them, swapping stinging lines in a sassy faux lover's tryst. This tender, angst-soaked blues rock number, initially crafted to give Nicks a fighting chance of getting her feet out the door as a gratified solo artist, would go on to be one of her biggest ever hits. It would also lay the foundations of her lifelong friendship with Petty, a bond which would see her later dubbed as the honorary fifth member of The Heartbreakers, simultaneously granting Nicks' former wish of joining the band and breaking their old rule of there being \\\"no girls allowed\\\".\\n\\n4. Leather And Lace - Bella Donna (1981)\\n\\nThis folksy lullaby-like ballad is considered by Nicks to be \\u201cone of the most special love songs\\u201d she\\u2019s ever written. A vulnerable reflection on her previous relationships with bandmate Lindsey Buckingham and the Eagles\\u2019 Don Henley (who actually duets with her on the track), the song marries dainty, twinkling keys and gentle acoustic guitar strums with honey-sweet lyrics about two personalities coming together to balance out each other\\u2019s differences; night and light, the city and mountains, leather and lace. Initially intended to be sung by Waylon Jennings and his then-wife Jessi Colter, Nicks took back the track after finding out the pair were planning on breaking up. A smart move.\\n\\n5. Sorcerer - Trouble In Shangri-La (2001)\\n\\nWhile the official (and greatest) take of this track was created in 2001 with Sheryl Crow for Nicks\\u2019 Trouble In Shangri-La album, another version of Sorcerer was recorded during the Wild Heart sessions in 1983, following its even earlier origins in 1972, when it was written during her tenure as part of folk duo Buckingham Nicks with then-boyfriend and future Fleetwood Mac bandmate Lindsey Buckingham. The noughties' release leans into the original; stripped-back, raw guitar plucks like the sound of autumnal crunching leaves, earthy and cosy, the feeling of being back in home territory. During the track\\u2019s creation, Nicks was grappling with her new life in Hollywood, surrounded by \\u201cblack ink darkness\\u201d and the garish glamour of the area; a place worlds away from her life as a \\u201clady from the mountains\\u201d. Bluesy and western-tinged, Sorcerer remains one of Nicks\\u2019 most soulfully unpolished releases to date, reflective of a calmer epoch of her career.\\n\\n6. Wild Heart - The Wild Heart (1983)\\n\\nIf you thought Kate Bush\\u2019s Wuthering Heights was the only famous pop rock song to be inspired by the 1847 Emily Bront\\u00eb novel of the same name, you may be surprised to know that Nick\\u2019s Wild Heart, the title-track of her 1983 album, was also derived from the doomed romance of the story\\u2019s characters Heathcliff and Cathy. Written as a way of supporting listeners through their own moments of heartbreak, the seven minute-long track is driven by a marching, resolute rhythm and defiant vocals about having an emotionally intense heart. As Nicks once noted: \\\"it takes you through your nervous breakdown and through your recovery, and it takes you through your survival.\\\" It was first unveiled during a Rolling Stone cover photoshoot.\\n\\n7. Talk To Me - Rock A Little (1985)\\n\\nThis fist-clenching power ballad may not have been written by Nicks - it was actually helmed by Chas Sandford, who co-wrote John Waite's 1984 hit Missing You, which does sound somewhat similar - but we can't imagine it climbing the charts as well as it did (peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and the top spot on Billboard Top Mainstream Rock Songs) without the husky rasp of her vocal behind it to level out the saccharine pop-heavy schmaltz. With direct lyrics about encouraging a lover to unveil their hidden emotions, Talk To Me is definitely one of Nicks' most romantically upfront tracks; a glittering sappy love letter, whimsical and warm.\\n\\n8. I Can't Wait - Rock A Little (1985)\\n\\nIf there ever was a song that perfectly encapsulated the 80s era, it would be Stevie Nicks\\u2019 I Can\\u2019t Wait; a cocaine-fuelled, heat-in-the-moment rush through the dizzying heights of love and rockstar excess, a song that is even apparently required for the listener to let themselves go \\u201ca little crazy\\u201d to properly understand it. Bursting with hyperactivity, as recorded in Zo\\u00eb Howe\\u2019s book Stevie Nicks: Visions, Dreams and Rumours, following its one-and-done recording session - where Nicks sang the vocal part in a single take to capture the track\\u2019s spontaneous magic - she danced wildly through the night with her friends, playing the song on a constant repeat. To top things off, it comes with a bonkers music video which sees Nicks and an entourage of backup dancers (including her younger brother, Chris) stomping up and down a staircase while being blasted by wind machines.\\n\\n9. Stand Back - The Wild Heart (1983)\\n\\nOpening with a palpitating bass synth line that could easily shake a room if played through an adequate-enough sound system, Stand Back, as Nicks previously described herself, \\u201cstarts with an energy that comes from somewhere unknown\\u2026and it seems to have no time-space\\u201d. Darkly cosmic, the song soon expands in colour, diving into a magnificently funky guitar piece from Prince, who found his way onto the track after Nicks revealed how it was derived from his own Little Red Corvette, which she first discovered via her car radio while on a drive to her honeymoon with Kim Anderson in 1983. Prince and Nicks imbued the song with their two polarising personalities to create a sparkling and shadowy pop classic, which became the lead single to her second studio album The Wild Heart.\\n\\n10. Edge Of Seventeen - Bella Donna (1981)\\n\\nEdge Of Seventeen stands as the definitive track of Stevie Nicks\\u2019 solo career; a jubilant and bohemian swansong that encapsulates everything that fuels the Fleetwood Mac frontwoman\\u2019s songwriting; heartbreak, loss, magic and mystery. While it might be coloured by a celebratory feel, peaked by a dramatic chorus, the track is far less a jovial paean than it is a poignant nod to tragedy, spurred on by the \\u201cviolent death\\u201d of John Lennon and Nicks\\u2019 uncle Bill, who died shortly after from cancer in 1981. The track also harks back to the wilderness of her formative years in Phoenix, and the mysterious \\u201cwhite-winged dove\\u201d that resides there. \\u201cTo me, the white-winged dove was for John Lennon the dove of peace, and for my uncle, it was the white-winged dove who lives in the saguaro cactus\\u2026and it does make a sound like \\u2018whooo, whooo, whooo\\u2019\\u201d she once noted, speaking of the lyrics.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Jalopnik\", \"author\": \"Erin Marquis\", \"title\": \"Watch Just How Aggravating A Ride In A Self-Driving Taxi Can Be\", \"description\": \"What seemed like a simple trip turned into an odyssey of false starts and dodgy behavior after one San Francisco journalist attempted to take a Waymo self-driving taxi to a small local museum.Read more...\", \"url\": \"https://jalopnik.com/watch-just-how-aggravating-a-ride-in-a-self-driving-tax-1850595429\", \"text\": \"What seemed like a simple trip turned into an odyssey of false starts and dodgy behavior after one San Francisco journalist attempted to take a Waymo self-driving taxi to a small local museum.\\n\\nSan Francisco residents are fairly fed up with their streets being used as a testing ground for the emerging technology.

It took several seconds and contact with the Waymo team to get the car moving again. This should have been a simple maneuver\\u2014really, one of the simplest a human driver can make, but the robotaxi botched it.\\n\\nAdvertisement Advertisement\\n\\nThe next screw-up came when the taxi turned the wrong way and dropped Melendez off in front of a house with instructions for her to climb a very steep hill full of cactus and succulents and walk a further 5 minutes up to the museum. She was forced to call support, which told her to give the car another go at figuring out where it needed to be. The taxi then looped the block only to drop Melendez off in front of the same house.\\n\\n\\u201cHad there been a driver here I would have said \\u201cHey, you know, this is the wrong location! and I\\u2019d give him the instructions except there\\u2019s nobody here right now,\\u201d she said in the video. She points out sure, she could scramble up the steep hill and walk to the museum, but what about people who are less physically able (the people self-driving cars are supposed to help the most) or have small children or a load of groceries. And really, it\\u2019s providing a different level of service than requested.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIn the end, Melendez drove her own car the relatively simple route to pick up her son from the Randall Museum. You don\\u2019t have to be riding in a self-driving taxi for these new pieces of technology to totally derail your day, of course. San Francisco residents have pretty much had it with being a sandbox for self-driving car developers. The taxis have disrupted first responders, trapped public transit, and cause traffic jams across the city.\\n\\nRight now, the taxis are limited in where and when they can operate, but those limits are also lifting. San Francisco residents will have a chance to vote July 13 on whether or not to allow self-driving taxis to operate 24 hours a day.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Sopitas.com\", \"author\": \"Viviana Cohen\", \"title\": \"Y a todo esto\\u2026 \\u00bfcu\\u00e1l es el final de los juegos cl\\u00e1sicos que nunca terminamos?\", \"description\": \"Es hora de subirnos a una m\\u00e1quina del tiempo y recordar esos juegos cl\\u00e1sicos de computadora y celular con los que crecimos.

All opinions expressed are those of the author.\\n\\nMinifigures\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, the Dream World is populated by countless unusual characters, many of whom appear in the LEGO range. However, odd characters can also be found in the Waking World, including Mrs. Castillo! An interesting dual-moulded element forms her dress and backpack, with the arms introduced in the Super Mario theme plugged into either side.\\n\\nTheir shape seems decidedly unnatural, so I would have preferred the arms developed for the Minions to be re-used instead. Otherwise, the minifigure looks marvellous. The reddish brown backpack is neatly constructed from an ingot and a 2x1 bow, but could be easily adapted with other accoutrements, depending on Mrs. Castillo's needs during her adventures.\\n\\nOnly the double-sided head and white hair component are retained from standard minifigures and these convey plenty of personality. The decoration on the dress looks lovely as well, even though the white lotus designs are hardly noticeable against the aqua piece. They are visible in renders of the minifigure, but are much less obvious in reality.\\n\\nMateo is the protagonist of DREAMZzz and appears in many sets accordingly, so it is fortunate that his minifigure is excellent. The new hair piece is brilliantly textured and its green highlights look nice, corresponding with Mateo's green eye. The torso also features a green strap, which connects to a belt element in other sets. That is omitted here to accommodate a backpack, but the minifigure does feature dual-moulded legs.\\n\\nDespite appearances, Zoey does not include dual-moulded legs. Nonetheless, her minifigure also captures impressive detail, again featuring a new hair element with fantastic texture. The purple shade is not easily adaptable for other characters, but I hope this piece appears in other colours soon. However, purple hair suits this minifigure, complementing Zoey's dark blue and lavender attire.\\n\\nBoth characters display the Dream Chasers' hourglass symbol, which is also printed on top of Zoey's accessory. A purple bow is also provided, while Mateo carries his brick-built pencil staff. Originally a normal pencil, the staff incorporates a 4L bar and a lightsaber hilt in flame yellowish orange, an uncommon colour for these parts.\\n\\nThe pencil staff suits Mateo, given his love of drawing. That skill brought Z-Blob into existence, a gooey creature able to transform its body. Four versions of the character are available across the range and this example includes the trans-bright green piece designed for the Slime Singer from VIDIYO, albeit without decoration. The eyes are printed on a bright green minifigure head underneath instead.\\n\\nZ-Blob also incorporates a new body component, shared with a Grimspawn. These nightmare creatures serve the Nightmare King and many are inspired by existing LEGO themes, hence this character wears a knight's helmet. Also, the trans-pink flame is shared by a number of Grimspawn, as they seem to burn with energy in the animated series.\\n\\nThe new body piece is proportionally similar to the now-retired microfigures launched in 2009, albeit featuring a separate head on this occasion. This provides much greater opportunity for customisation and the figures can even interact with accessories because their arms fit over anything with the width of a standard bar, as shown below.\\n\\nThe Completed Model\\n\\nMrs. Castillo serves burritos from her van in the Waking World, although adaptations have been made for this set, so the van sells Dream Crafting equipment. The sand green and white colour scheme remains intact from the animation though, while the shape of the vehicle is familiar too. Evidently inspired by the Volkswagen Camper Van, I expect some will customise the design for LEGO City.\\n\\nThe vehicle is eight studs wide, which is relatively substantial, but the designer has definitely taken advantage of that size. For instance, windscreen wipers are included and the doors are functional. A printed Dream Chasers' symbol adorns the front and stickers are applied on the top and side, hinting towards the potential transformation into the Turtle Van.\\n\\nMrs. Castillo's pet turtle, Se\\u00f1or Tortuga, is sadly not included, but I like the sticker alluding to him on the side. There is room for two minifigures inside the cab, including Mrs. Castillo, despite her unusual body shape. The roof is detachable to reach the interior, which continues into the back of the van, where minifigures can stand to serve customers.\\n\\nA few more stickers form a striped awning and signage, advertising Tortuga's Dreamcraft Shop and three of the items available to buy. The serving window looks good, but I dislike the visible studs and clips underneath. While these are needed for the transformation, the exterior is very smooth elsewhere, so perhaps they could have been disguised for the van's appearance in the Waking World.\\n\\nThe items advertised outside are found inside the van, including a potion, a trans-opalescent blue crystal and a mushroom. I appreciate such continuity and the patterned floor, but there is ample space for additional accessories and more are supplied for the van's Dream World forms. These are shown on a blackboard, but not used in the instructions at this stage, strangely.\\n\\nSand green is a new colour for the 2x4x2 wheel arches, which look brilliant in combination with the wheels. This is partly because the wheels are actually offset by half a stud, as 1x2 plates with side rails inside prevent the Technic pins moving too far inwards or protruding too much. Another sticker forms the number plate on the back and features the initials of the set designer, Freddy Charters.\\n\\nUpon entering the Dream World, the whole van becomes a shell for Se\\u00f1or Tortuga. The turtle's legs sprout from the wheels and his head appears on the front, connected to a ball joint. A few accessories are added on top too, alongside Cat Cactus. Once these features are added, the vehicle looks wonderfully wacky, so fits seamlessly into the realm of DREAMZzz.\\n\\nThe head comprises a printed shoulder armour piece and a 1x4 curved window frame, which has not appeared in flame yellowish orange before. The seam between them forms the mouth and the head can move up and down, but sideways motion is very limited. Also, the legs can be positioned as though walking by swapping the curved tube elements around, even though only the feet are actually articulated.\\n\\nMrs. Castillo seemingly directs Se\\u00f1or Tortuga by dangling a carrot above him, although the rod holding the carrot should be longer, especially because the turtle cannot actually look upwards. The weapons sketched on the aforementioned blackboard are also mounted on the van in this format, connecting to those clips beneath the serving window.\\n\\nVarious apparently unrelated items are placed on the roof, including a treasure chest, a small palm tree and the mysterious Cat Cactus. This character is present in 71459 Stable of Dream Creatures too, residing in a medium nougat pot and featuring a printed dome. These additions to the van can only be described as bizarre, as I would expect in the Dream World.\\n\\nTurtles are not known for their speed, but it seems swapping Se\\u00f1or Tortuga's carrot for a chilli pepper sends him into overdrive! A periscope and fin replace the array of items on top in this configuration, while Cat Cactus' pot becomes a thruster. Also, the legs are reconstructed as though swept back by the sheer speed of the vehicle.\\n\\nI imagine this will be the least popular of the three possible designs, although I think the rocket-propelled turtle is a fun concept. The dual-moulded flame on the back looks superb, combining flame yellowish orange and trans-yellow plastics. This piece is available in several DREAMZzz sets and in five different colours, but the yellow-tinted version only appears twice.\\n\\nCat Cactus also becomes rocket-propelled, as the trans-purple flame used as a blade earlier becomes a thruster. In addition, the cactus' pink flower is replaced with a golden spike on top and a saddle for a minifigure is connected to the back, presumably because this is considered the cactus' battle mode!\\n\\nNot every piece is used for each of the Turtle Van's configurations, but this one includes almost all of them. The treasure chest and palm tree, for instance, are attached on a 4x4 round plate, previously used to display the weapons. A crystal is found inside the chest and the palm tree looks fantastic, making excellent use of the fern components introduced in 10316 The Lord of the Rings: Rivendell.\\n\\nOverall\\n\\nComparisons have been drawn between DREAMZzz and the sets from The LEGO Movie, as both include relatively mundane subjects that can transform into something fantastical. 71456 Mrs. Castillo's Turtle Van undoubtedly lives up to this comparison. The outlandish nature of the design will not appeal to everyone, but I find it charming, especially given the ponderous turtle mode.\\n\\nThe three options for building the Turtle Van are appealing and you can switch between them quickly, as they only require partial reassembly. However, not all the pieces are used for each design, which could lead to concerns about the price of \\u00a342.99, $47.99 or \\u20ac47.99. That seems expensive to me, but I still find the set appealing on the whole.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Desencadenado.com\", \"author\": \"Leopoldo Cortes\", \"title\": \"Nueva tendencia en decoraci\\u00f3n de dormitorios sin punto final.\", \"description\": \"Las camas sin cabecero: Una tendencia en crecimiento en los dormitorios La decoraci\\u00f3n de dormitorios ha evolucionado en los \\u00faltimos a\\u00f1os y las camas sin cabecero se han convertido en una opci\\u00f3n cada vez m\\u00e1s popular.

Esta nueva tendencia ofrece la posibilidad de crear ambientes con un estilo \\u00fanico y resaltar otros elementos decorativos. Adem\\u00e1s, son ideales para habitaciones peque\\u00f1as o para generar una sensaci\\u00f3n de amplitud. Existen diferentes dise\\u00f1os y estilos de camas sin cabecera para adaptarse a cualquier tipo de decoraci\\u00f3n.\\n\\n\\u00bfQu\\u00e9 son las camas sin cabecero?\\n\\nLas camas sin cabecero son aquellas que no tienen la pieza alargada que com\\u00fanmente se encuentra en el respaldo de la cama. Estas camas se caracterizan por tener un dise\\u00f1o sencillo y minimalista, lo cual las hace una opci\\u00f3n perfecta para crear espacios modernos. Sin embargo, tambi\\u00e9n existen modelos con acabados m\\u00e1s elaborados e incluso con dise\\u00f1os personalizados.\\n\\nLas ventajas de elegir una cama sin cabecero\\n\\nLas camas sin cabecera ofrecen numerosas ventajas, entre ellas la posibilidad de utilizarlas en habitaciones peque\\u00f1as, ya que ocupan menos espacio que las camas convencionales. Adem\\u00e1s, permiten resaltar otros elementos de la habitaci\\u00f3n y facilitan la limpieza del dormitorio al no tener respaldo.\\n\\nConsejos para encontrar la cama sin cabecero perfecta\\n\\nA la hora de elegir una cama sin cabecero, es importante considerar varios aspectos. Debemos seleccionar una cama que se ajuste a nuestras necesidades y gustos personales, teniendo en cuenta el tama\\u00f1o, la calidad de los materiales, el dise\\u00f1o y la estabilidad. Es recomendable que el dise\\u00f1o se adapte al estilo de la habitaci\\u00f3n y que la cama sea c\\u00f3moda para descansar. Adem\\u00e1s, es importante tener en cuenta la altura de la cama, ya que no todas tienen la misma.\\n\\nIdeas para decorar una habitaci\\u00f3n con cama sin cabecero\\n\\nLa pared se convierte en uno de los elementos principales de una habitaci\\u00f3n con cama sin cabecero. Existen diferentes opciones para decorarla de manera original y creativa.\\n\\nUtilizar papel pintado: tendencias y consejos\\n\\nEl papel pintado es una excelente opci\\u00f3n para vestir la pared del cabecero. Dependiendo del estampado o color que elijamos, se pueden crear diferentes ambientes y estilos. Actualmente, se encuentra la tendencia de utilizar papel con motivos naturales, como hojas, ramas y flores, para aportar un toque fresco y relajado. Para habitaciones m\\u00e1s sofisticadas, los papeles con dise\\u00f1os geom\\u00e9tricos o abstractos son ideales. Los tonos pastel crean ambientes suaves y rom\\u00e1nticos, mientras que los tonos oscuros aportan elegancia y sofisticaci\\u00f3n.\\n\\nPintar la pared del cabecero: trucos y recomendaciones\\n\\nSi preferimos pintar la pared, es importante tener en cuenta varios factores, como la elecci\\u00f3n del color y el acabado. Los colores claros aportan luminosidad y sensaci\\u00f3n de amplitud en habitaciones peque\\u00f1as, mientras que los colores oscuros acent\\u00faan la personalidad del espacio en habitaciones grandes con poca luz natural. El acabado depender\\u00e1 del estilo deseado: las pinturas de acabado mate son ideales para estilos minimalistas, mientras que los acabados satinados aportan luminosidad y brillo.\\n\\nDestacar una pared con un elemento decorativo: ideas inspiradoras\\n\\nLos elementos decorativos como cuadros, espejos o vinilos son ideales para destacar la pared del respaldo. Grandes cuadros con dibujos o fotograf\\u00edas aportan un toque personal y creativo a la habitaci\\u00f3n. Los espejos dan sensaci\\u00f3n de amplitud y maximizan la luz natural cuando se colocan frente a una ventana. Los vinilos ofrecen la posibilidad de crear un ambiente divertido y juvenil con dise\\u00f1os variados.\\n\\nFoco en otros elementos del dormitorio\\n\\nAl no tener cabecero, es esencial centrar la atenci\\u00f3n en otros elementos de la habitaci\\u00f3n para definir el estilo y crear un ambiente acogedor.\\n\\nDecorar con estanter\\u00edas: pr\\u00e1cticas y estilosas\\n\\nLas estanter\\u00edas son una excelente alternativa para crear un ambiente c\\u00e1lido y original. Al colocarlas alrededor de la cama y llenarlas de objetos decorativos, se crea un efecto est\\u00e9tico y estructurado. Tambi\\u00e9n permiten tener a mano libros, revistas y elementos decorativos, as\\u00ed como adornarlas con plantas, velas arom\\u00e1ticas o marcos de fotos.\\n\\nUtilizar cojines de diferentes texturas\\n\\nLos cojines son esenciales en cualquier habitaci\\u00f3n, ya que aportan confort y calidez. Al no tener cabecero, se pueden combinar cojines de terciopelo con cojines de piel sint\\u00e9tica para conseguir un efecto visual interesante y sofisticado.\\n\\nCrear un cabecero con pintura o madera reciclada\\n\\nUna opci\\u00f3n original y creativa es crear un cabecero con materiales reciclados. Se puede utilizar una tabla de madera y darle un toque vintage con pintura blanca, o colgar varios marcos de fotos en la pared creando un collage. La clave est\\u00e1 en experimentar con diferentes materiales y colores hasta encontrar la composici\\u00f3n adecuada.\\n\\nMuebles y accesorios en una habitaci\\u00f3n con cama sin cabecero\\n\\nLos muebles y accesorios desempe\\u00f1an un papel fundamental en la definici\\u00f3n del estilo de la habitaci\\u00f3n y en la creaci\\u00f3n de un ambiente acogedor.\\n\\nLuces colgantes y l\\u00e1mparas de pie: un toque de estilo\\n\\nLas luces colgantes y las l\\u00e1mparas de pie son ideales para a\\u00f1adir estilo y crear ambientes relajantes. Las luces colgantes se adaptan a habitaciones de estilo n\\u00f3rdico o minimalista, mientras que las l\\u00e1mparas de pie son perfectas para habitaciones de estilo bohemio o vintage. Adem\\u00e1s, se pueden encontrar o fabricar l\\u00e1mparas artesanales con cuerdas, mimbre o madera para a\\u00f1adir un toque personal y \\u00fanico.\\n\\nEspejos: m\\u00e1s que un elemento decorativo\\n\\nLos espejos aportan luminosidad y sensaci\\u00f3n de amplitud a la habitaci\\u00f3n. Combinar varios espejos de diferentes tama\\u00f1os y formas en una misma pared crea un efecto visual interesante.\\n\\nPlantas altas: una decoraci\\u00f3n natural y fresca\\n\\nLas plantas aportan frescura y limpieza a la habitaci\\u00f3n. Las plantas altas son ideales para aprovechar techos altos y a\\u00f1adir elegancia. Ficus, palmeras y cactus son opciones que se adaptan a cualquier tipo de decoraci\\u00f3n.\\n\\nCamas sin cabecero en diferentes estilos de decoraci\\u00f3n\\n\\nLas camas sin cabecera se adaptan a cualquier estilo decorativo. Algunos ejemplos son el estilo n\\u00f3rdico, que combina minimalismo y elegancia con madera natural sin tratar, y el estilo bohemio o vintage, que se caracteriza por su calidez y eclecticismo.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Noticiasautomotivas.com.br\", \"author\": \"Ricardo de Oliveira\", \"title\": \"Citro\\u00ebn C4 Cactus despenca em vendas; futuro \\u00e9 incerto?\", \"description\": \"O Citro\\u00ebn C4 Cactus desabou em vendas, mesmo com o programa do carro popular do governo federal e s\\u00f3 em junho, apenas 143 unidades foram emplacadas, um n\\u00famero\", \"url\": \"https://www.noticiasautomotivas.com.br/citroen-c4-cactus-despenca-em-vendas-futuro-e-incerto/\", \"text\": \"O Citro\\u00ebn C4 Cactus desabou em vendas, mesmo com o programa do carro popular do governo federal e s\\u00f3 em junho, apenas 143 unidades foram emplacadas, um n\\u00famero surreal para o crossover do duplo chevron.\\n\\nCom 1.831 unidades vendidas no primeiro semestre, o C4 Cactus \\u00e9 atualmente uma sombra do que foi em 2022, quando no mesmo per\\u00edodo, o modelo vendeu 10.618 exemplares.\\n\\nS\\u00f3 em junho de 2022, foram 3.664 unidades, mais que o dobro do vendido nos seis primeiros meses de 2023, com uma diferen\\u00e7a de apenas duas unidades a mais para o resultado do ano passado.

Y lo mismo se aplica a esas rondas que se ganan por la m\\u00ednima, cuya sentencia se decide a c\\u00e1mara lenta. Reduci\\u00e9ndose todo a una ecuaci\\u00f3n sencilla de entender: m\\u00e1s contundencia sumado a m\\u00e1s iniciativas a la hora de atacar da como resultado unos mejores combates.\\n\\nY es que, como veremos, la agresividad es el combustible de esta octava entrega, y eso acaba siendo sin\\u00f3nimo de espect\\u00e1culo.\\n\\nNo solo a trav\\u00e9s de las t\\u00e9cnicas y los combos al estilo Tekken, sino de c\\u00f3mo estos se conjugan con unas nuevas mec\\u00e1nicas de juego sencillas (pero acertad\\u00edsimas) que elevan la tensi\\u00f3n de cada ronda y aumentan el ya de por s\\u00ed fren\\u00e9tico ritmo que siempre ha caracterizado los combates la saga. Caracter\\u00edsticas que se sienten de vicio en las partidas online gracias a la implementaci\\u00f3n -\\u00a1por fin!- del Rollback Netcode.\\n\\nEn VidaExtra no solo pusimos a prueba los 16 luchadores ya anunciados de Tekken 8, sino que celebramos c\\u00f3mo ha pasado la primera gran prueba de fuego de esta nueva etapa: la experiencia online. De hecho, ya te adelantamos que por fin va a ser una aut\\u00e9ntica gozada intercambiar tollinas online con amigos y desconocidos. O, al menos, ya es tan divertido como hacerlo a dos mandos compartiendo sof\\u00e1.\\n\\n\\u00bfEl mejor Tekken de todos? Pese a que todav\\u00eda es temprano para llegar a esa conclusi\\u00f3n, las novedades est\\u00e1n bien encauzadas: si vienes de las entregas anteriores, vas a alucinar. Y si es tu primera vez, est\\u00e1s de enhorabuena: dar palizotas \\u00e9picas al estilo Mishima jam\\u00e1s hab\\u00eda estado al alcance de tantos jugadores.\\n\\nM\\u00e1s bruto. M\\u00e1s trepidante. M\\u00e1s Tekken\\n\\nCuando decimos que la agresividad es el combustible de Tekken 8, vamos muy en serio: todas las novedades sustanciales de esta entrega van encauzadas a que los jugadores tomen la iniciativa y sean mucho m\\u00e1s proactivos al atacar, posicionarse o tratar de someter en cada ronda. No es que ya no se penalicen las aperturas (el temido punish al golpear a destiempo) sino que se a\\u00f1aden mejores herramientas, m\\u00e1s potenciadores y un mayor nivel de estrategia subyacente.\\n\\nLos superataques cinem\\u00e1ticos (o Rage Arts) regresan desde Tekken 7, siendo ese \\u00faltimo recurso demoledor cuando el luchador est\\u00e1 a uno o dos combos de perder la ronda. Ejecutarlos es tan sencillo como pulsar un bot\\u00f3n cuando la barra de salud cruza una marca establecida, aunque la clave no est\\u00e1 en el c\\u00f3mo ejecutarlo; sino en el cu\\u00e1ndo llevar a cabo esta maniobra. Y es ah\\u00ed donde entra en juego el Heat System.\\n\\nJusto bajo la barra de salud se puede ver una barra llamada Heat Timer que est\\u00e1 llena desde el comienzo de cada ronda. La puedes activar con un bot\\u00f3n o con una serie de combo espec\\u00edfico de cada luchador, llamados Heat Engagers, y los efectos se traducen en mayor fuerza y mejoras concretas en funci\\u00f3n del personaje.\\n\\nL\\u00f3gicamente, estos efectos son por tiempo limitado. Una vez gastamos todo el Heat la barra desaparece hasta la siguiente ronda. Se acab\\u00f3. Pero ahora viene lo interesante: podemos frenar el consumo del Heat Timer a base de golpear, atacar o forzar a que nuestro rival se cubra.\\n\\nPese a que lo ideal es mantener el estado de Heat todo lo posible, lo cual implicar\\u00eda que nuestra proporci\\u00f3n de ataques certeros ha sido mayor que la del oponente, Tekken 8 da la opci\\u00f3n de cerrar esta iniciativa por todo lo alto con un Heat Smash. Un s\\u00faper remate que no tiene la espectacularidad y la contundencia del Rage Art, pero que logra ese efecto de traca final llev\\u00e1ndose una buena porci\\u00f3n de la barra de salud del enemigo.\\n\\nTekken 8 busca y consigue que se produzcan con m\\u00e1s frecuencia esos roces que resquebrajan las intenciones del rival, derivando en combos letales y, a la vez, propiciando remates atronadores que sentencian las rondas o, en su defecto, dejan la barra de salud del adversario tiritando. Logrando, a base de beneficiar los reflejos y la disciplina, que cada victoria sepa de un modo especial y cada derrota sea sin\\u00f3nimo de una lecci\\u00f3n aprendida.\\n\\nComo resultado, las partidas de Tekken 8 son m\\u00e1s din\\u00e1micas, los combos menos previsibles y se combate esa tan inc\\u00f3moda sensaci\\u00f3n de enfrentarse a rivales que se protegen de manera met\\u00f3dica hasta encontrar la brecha en nuestro ataque. Ahora llevar la iniciativa no solo se recompensa, sino que nos da una situaci\\u00f3n m\\u00e1s ventajosa.\\n\\nY eso, como comentamos, se acaba traduciendo en partidas m\\u00e1s brutas, m\\u00e1s agresivas y m\\u00e1s divertidas. Al menos con los personajes que hemos podido probar.\\n\\nTekken 8 frente al espejo de la s\\u00e9ptima entrega\\n\\nSi vienes de Tekken 7 te vas a sentir como en casa. Si esta es tu primera toma de contacto con la saga del Pu\\u00f1o de hierro, Bandai Namco te va a poner todas las facilidades por delante para que te lo pases bien. Tekken 8 adapta el esquema jugable cl\\u00e1sico, nacido en los arcades, para que todo el mundo se luzca en pantalla. Sin excepciones. Aunque, para variar, ya te adelantamos que ser\\u00e1n aquellos que dominen el ritmo y los combos los que tendr\\u00e1n la partida ganada por adelantado. Entre otras cosas, porque todo el mundo puede activar o desactivar con un bot\\u00f3n y sobre la marcha del Estilo Cl\\u00e1sico al Estilo Especial, un sistema que te permite acceder a t\\u00e9cnicas complejas de manera simple.\\n\\nEl Estilo Especial no es exactamente un sistema de Autocombos (como el visto en Tekken 7), sino un cambio de la manera de jugar, de modo que se pasa de las cl\\u00e1sicas secuencias de combos y t\\u00e9cnicas de los juegos de lucha a recursos inmediatos como en los juegos de acci\\u00f3n m\\u00e1s tradicional. Reservando un bot\\u00f3n para los ataques especiales, uno para el ataque blindado, un tercero para hacer combos y malabares y otro para realizar esos ataques bajos que en Tekken casi siempre nos pillan desprevenidos.\\n\\nDe hecho, alternar entre los estilos Cl\\u00e1sico y Especial es tan sencillo como darle a un bot\\u00f3n, con lo que en la pr\\u00e1ctica todos los jugadores tienen lo mejor de ambos mundos, se benefician del sistema de Heat por igual y hace casi innecesario tener memorizar combinaciones para realizar acciones espec\\u00edficas al jugar con luchadores que no tengamos dominados o aquellos jam\\u00e1s hayamos tocado. Otra cosa diferente es que \\u00e9sto nos de ventaja frente a aquellos que dominan el personaje que controlan al dedillo.\\n\\nSiguiendo con las comparaciones, la base de las entregas numeradas de Tekken se conserva: aprovechar las condiciones de cada escenario y convertir nuestros pu\\u00f1etazos y patadas en r\\u00e1fagas letales y golpes explosivos gana puntos enteros al recibir ese extra de agresividad. Conservando intactos los aciertos y cimientos de la entrega anterior y llev\\u00e1ndolos de manera certera al siguiente nivel.\\n\\nA nivel visual se ha dado un salto enorme: Tekken 8 usa el Unreal Engine 5 y eso no solo garantiza combates m\\u00e1s fluidos, sino personajes y escenarios mucho m\\u00e1s detallados y con m\\u00e1s rasgos. Durante los s\\u00faper ataques de Rage podemos ver c\\u00f3mo los m\\u00fasculos se tensan, c\\u00f3mo las expresiones faciales ganan matices y much\\u00edsimos m\\u00e1s efectos en pantalla sin que se lastre el ritmo de la partida.\\n\\nSin embargo, al final nos encontramos con un elemento curioso: a diferencia de Street Fighter 6, el cual ha recibido un nuevo estilo art\\u00edstico, todas \\u00e9stas mejoras derivadas del cambio de motor son mucho m\\u00e1s disimuladas a ojos de quien ve la evoluci\\u00f3n de esta entrega desde fuera de la saga. Y, para muestra, aqu\\u00ed puedes ver una comparativa de c\\u00f3mo luce Tekken 8 frente al t\\u00edtulo anterior.\\n\\nTekken 8 en PS5\\n\\nTekken 7 en Xbox One\\n\\nDicho lo cual, aquellos que vengan a esta entrega en busca de esa jugabilidad asentada en realizar secuencias de botones a un ritmo espec\\u00edfico se van a llenar los bolsillos: de momento Tekken 8 ha anunciado 16 personajes (dos menos de los que Street Fighter 6 ofrece de lanzamiento) y solo uno de ellos no estaba presente en Tekken 7.\\n\\nLa gran incorporaci\\u00f3n -de momento- es Jun, la desaparecida madre de Jin Kazama, que est\\u00e1 de vuelta con un estilo que ha evolucionado una barbaridad desde que abandon\\u00f3 la saga en Tekken 2. Eso s\\u00ed, no nos olvidamos que Jun regres\\u00f3 para las dos entregas de Tekken Tag Tournament y Tekken Revolution. El resto de personajes han recibido un tratamiento que se beneficia enormemente del Unreal Engine en lo visual, y las mec\\u00e1nicas de Heat en lo jugable.\\n\\nQuiz\\u00e1s el salto visual solo se manifieste al comparar ambos juegos, pero hay una asignatura que Tekken 8 debe reforzar de aqu\\u00ed a su lanzamiento: necesita dar un golpe sobre la mesa en lo que respecta a una selecci\\u00f3n de personajes que, pese a no poderse medir en cantidad (al menos de salida) con Tekken 7, debe resultar igual o m\\u00e1s atractiva que \\u00e9sta. Y eso significar\\u00e1 dejar fuera a personajes importantes o guardarlos para futuros DLCs, recuperar otros desaparecidos y, lo m\\u00e1s dif\\u00edcil de todo, incorporar rostros nuevos.\\n\\nTekken por fin ofrecer\\u00e1 un online fluido y con juego cruzado\\n\\nEn lo que respecta a las partidas online, Tekken 7 se dejaba jugar, pero no estaba precisamente a la vanguardia de un g\\u00e9nero que se mantiene vivo y da su raz\\u00f3n de ser a nuevos DLCs a trav\\u00e9s de su esencia competitiva. Tekken 8 es plenamente consciente de ello y apuesta fuerte por la tecnolog\\u00eda Rollback Netcode. Y, tras ponerlo a prueba con partidas en servidores de todo el mundo, ya te adelanto que funciona de maravilla.\\n\\nEn esencia, se trata de un sistema predictivo en el cual se anticipa lo que ambos jugadores van a hacer y cu\\u00e1ndo, maquillando el posible lag. En caso de que no se cumplan las posibles predicciones, se revierten los fotogramas, pero a todos los efectos se logra una sensaci\\u00f3n online que quiz\\u00e1s no sea exactamente igual a la de jugar en la misma consola y compartiendo sof\\u00e1, pero se queda lo suficientemente cerca como para evitar frustraciones.\\n\\nEn Tekken 8 el Rollback Netcode es algo trascendental, ya que el ritmo a la hora de ejecutar los combos y movimientos especiales es crucial y, en muchas ocasiones, los combates se resuelven en un apote\\u00f3sico intercambio de golpes que gana dramatismo al mostrarse a c\\u00e1mara lenta. Lo cual no quita lo m\\u00e1s esencial: antes de buscar rivales online, podremos filtrar por calidad de conexi\\u00f3n e incluso, por plataforma.\\n\\nEl otro gran acierto de Tekken 8 es apostar por el juego cruzado, de modo que todos los jugadores de PlayStation, Xbox y PC jugar\\u00e1n juntos. Algo que, todo sea dicho, ya ofrece Street Fighter 6 o Guilty Gear Strive. Podemos activarlo o desactivarlo de manera sencilla, pero el logro mayor es que todos los jugadores forman parte de la misma comunidad. Ahora toca definir qu\\u00e9 clase de modos online se ofrecer\\u00e1n.\\n\\nLa versi\\u00f3n a la que tuvimos acceso hac\\u00eda que esper\\u00e1semos en una especie de sala de entrenamiento donde pod\\u00edamos elegir personaje, rival y escenario e incluso practicar los combos contra un mu\\u00f1eco hasta completar el matchmaking.\\n\\nTocar\\u00e1 esperar un poquito m\\u00e1s para ver c\\u00f3mo es posible crear salas p\\u00fablicas o privadas, unirse a ellas o hacer sencillo algo tan b\\u00e1sico como improvisar partidas con amigos. Porque sobra decir que Bandai Namco siempre ha cuidado de un modo especial el modo historia de Tekken, pero si Tekken 8 quiere ser la mejor entrega de todas deber\\u00e1 medirse con lo que ya ofrecen otros juegos del mismo calibre en el online. Y, a ser posible, superarlo.\\n\\nTekken 8 no puede permitirse ser una secuela: debe ofrecer un relevo generacional\\n\\nNuestras impresiones con Tekken 8 son realmente positivas. Como juego es brutal. Tal y como suena. Aporta buenas adiciones en la jugabilidad, m\\u00e1s recursos para veteranos y nuevos jugadores y un apartado t\\u00e9cnico que luce de maravilla, incluso en el offline. Todo ello construido sobre una base jugable que es y sigue siendo soberbia. \\u00bfSuficientes elementos para ponerlo a la vanguardia de los juegos de lucha?\\n\\nEl mayor rival de Tekken 8 no ser\\u00e1 ni Street Fighter ni Mortal Kombat, sino las semejanzas superficiales una entrega anterior a la que se parece mucho a nivel art\\u00edstico (que no t\\u00e9cnico) y con la que comparte la pr\\u00e1ctica totalidad de los personajes anunciados. Luchadores que ahora se mueven y se sienten a los controles mucho mejor, que conste, pero el precio que se est\\u00e1 pagando es que exista una inevitable comparaci\\u00f3n.\\n\\nEso no quiere decir que sean los mismos contenidos con nuevas mec\\u00e1nicas y en Unreal Engine 5, ni mucho menos. la manera de promover un juego m\\u00e1s agresivo y en\\u00e9rgico de Tekken 8 supone un paso en la buena direcci\\u00f3n para toda la saga. Que esas sensaciones sean llevadas al online, adem\\u00e1s, ser\\u00e1 absolutamente determinante con vistas a los planes de post-lanzamiento. Aunque todav\\u00eda queda mucho para hacer c\\u00e1balas sobre ellos: de momento no tenemos ni fecha de salida.\\n\\nSabemos que Tekken 8 llegar\\u00e1 a PS5, Xbox Series X / S y PC, pero ni siquiera se ha dejado caer que llegar\\u00e1 en 2023. La entrega anterior debut\\u00f3 con m\\u00e1s de 30 luchadores de salida, con lo que tienen muchos meses por delante para alcanzar una cifra similar y, ya puestos, introducir en propiedad personajes nuevos o invitados tan sorprendentes como ese Negan de The Walking Dead que acab\\u00f3 bate en mano, en el torneo del pu\\u00f1o de hierro.\\n\\nY lo mismo se aplica a los modos adicionales o al sistema que emplearemos para desbloquear ropa con la que personalizar a nuestros personajes. Porque, quiz\\u00e1s, Bandai Namco no haya hecho ni la menor menci\\u00f3n a la posibilidad de ponerle diferentes sombreros a Kazuya o Lili, pero es algo que todos los veteranos damos por hecho.\\n\\nEn cualquier caso, Tekken 8 ya es la revalidaci\\u00f3n de la f\\u00f3rmula que en 1994 nos conquist\\u00f3 en las recreativas. Que no mucho despu\\u00e9s arraig\\u00f3 con fuerza en consolas y, posiblemente, celebrar\\u00e1 su 30 aniversario en sistemas de novena generaci\\u00f3n y PCs aspirando a ser el mejor juego de toda la franquicia. La etiqueta de ser el m\\u00e1s brutal y contundente ya se la ha ganado a pulso.

De hecho, no creemos que exageremos al decir que algunos de los momentos m\\u00e1s ic\\u00f3nicos y memorables que hemos vivido en este hobby son recordados, precisamente, por la aparici\\u00f3n de alg\\u00fan tema concreto, transformando as\\u00ed una gran secuencia, fase o escena de v\\u00eddeo en algo \\u00e9pico e inolvidable.\\n\\nHoy es el D\\u00eda Mundial del Rock, un g\\u00e9nero musical que siempre ha estado muy relacionado con el ocio electr\\u00f3nico. A fin de cuentas, \\u00bfqu\\u00e9 mejor que alg\\u00fan temazo de este tipo para acompa\\u00f1ar la acci\\u00f3n de un videojuego? Por eso, hoy en Vandal hemos decidido dedicarle un homenaje seleccionando algunas de nuestras bandas sonoras favoritas en las que el rock y el metal son las grandes protagonistas. Para darle algo m\\u00e1s de variedad a esta lista, hemos escogido una \\u00fanica entrega por saga y hemos intentado que haya cierto equilibrio entre los t\\u00edtulos que cuenten con m\\u00fasica licenciada y aquellos que apuesten por composiciones originales. Y dicho esto, \\u00a1comenzamos!\\n\\nGuitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock\\n\\nSi hay un g\\u00e9nero en el que la m\\u00fasica es especialmente vital ese es, obviamente, el de los juegos musicales, ya que pierden casi todo su atractivo sin una buena lista de temas que nos animen a jugar. Aunque ahora est\\u00e1n un poco de capa ca\\u00edda, hace unos a\\u00f1os era normal ver en las tiendas un buen pu\\u00f1ado de t\\u00edtulos pensados para ser jugados con instrumentos de pl\\u00e1stico, una moda en la que la saga Guitar Hero fue la gran abanderada y que acab\\u00f3 culminando con su tercera entrega. Tanto es as\\u00ed que estamos ante una de las mayores y mejores selecciones de canciones y artistas que se ha hecho nunca para videojuego alguno. En total, m\\u00e1s de 70 temazos de grupos como Rage Against the Machine, Iron Maiden, Metallica, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, KISS, Aerosmith o Guns N\\u2019 Roses, por mencionar tan solo unos poqu\\u00edsimos ejemplos, algo a lo que hay que sumarle duelos tan emocionantes como los que ten\\u00edamos contra Slash, Tom Morello o el mism\\u00edsimo Diablo. Y s\\u00ed, no nos olvidamos de la infernal \\\"Through The Fire and Flames\\\" de Dragonforce, una de las canciones m\\u00e1s dif\\u00edciles, intensas y espectaculares a las que nos hemos enfrentado nunca en juego musical alguno.\\n\\nMarvel\\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy\\n\\nMarvel\\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy es un juego que solo por su selecci\\u00f3n de temas licenciados ya tiene su hueco m\\u00e1s que ganado en esta lista, ofreci\\u00e9ndonos un fant\\u00e1stico homenaje a la d\\u00e9cada de los 80 que incluye canciones tan m\\u00edticas como \\\"The Final Countdown\\\" de Europe, \\\"I Love It Loud\\\" de KISS, \\\"Kickstart My Heart\\\" de M\\u00f6tley Cr\\u00fce o \\\"Rock Rock (Till You Drop)\\\" de Def Leppard. Pero Eidos Montreal no se quiso conformar solo con esto y fue un paso m\\u00e1s all\\u00e1 para hacer algo realmente especial y \\u00fanico: grabar un \\u00e1lbum entero de much\\u00edsima calidad para un grupo de rock ficticio llamado Star-Lord que inspirar\\u00eda a Peter Quill a adoptar ese alias en la historia de la aventura. Sin duda, un juego que ser\\u00eda imposible de entender sin su m\\u00fasica.\\n\\nF-Zero X\\n\\nCada vez que nos toca escribir de F-Zero nos hacemos da\\u00f1o al recordar lo abandonad\\u00edsima que est\\u00e1 la saga por parte de Nintendo, pero no quer\\u00edamos pasar la oportunidad de incluir en este reportaje la banda sonora de F-Zero X, una de las mejores y m\\u00e1s ca\\u00f1eras que nos dej\\u00f3 Nintendo 64. No en vano, estamos hablando de una fant\\u00e1stica selecci\\u00f3n de temas repleta de guitarreos que captaban a la perfecci\\u00f3n la adrenalina desatada que supon\\u00eda pilotar naves antigravitatorias a m\\u00e1s de 1.000 kil\\u00f3metros por hora mientras compet\\u00edamos contra 29 rivales, elev\\u00e1ndonos el pulso hasta l\\u00edmites insospechados y regal\\u00e1ndonos melod\\u00edas que son ya todo un cl\\u00e1sico de la saga y que resulta imposible no acabar tarareando tras unas pocas partidas.\\n\\nTony Hawk\\u2019s Pro Skater 2\\n\\nElegir una \\u00fanica banda sonora de una saga como Tony Hawk\\u2019s no es precisamente f\\u00e1cil, dada la calidad que suelen atesorar con sus temas licenciados. Probablemente, muchos de vosotros os qued\\u00e9is con la de t\\u00edtulos como Tony Hawk\\u2019s Underground, una de las m\\u00e1s extensas de la serie y que m\\u00e1s nombres conocidos tiene, pero nosotros hemos decidido quedarnos con la de Tony Hawk\\u2019s Pro Skater 2 por su enorme importancia hist\\u00f3rica. Tanto es as\\u00ed que el \\u00e9xito de esta obra maestra de los juegos de skate dispar\\u00f3 la popularidad de un buen pu\\u00f1ado de grupos como Papa Roach o Millencollin, dej\\u00e1ndonos para el recuerdo una selecci\\u00f3n de temazos que hicieron que todas y cada una de nuestras partidas fuese toda una experiencia.\\n\\nHi-Fi Rush\\n\\nHi-Fi Rush se ha convertido en una de las grandes sorpresas de 2023. Un juego que Tango Gameworks hab\\u00eda guardado en secreto hasta que se anunci\\u00f3 y se lanz\\u00f3 el mismo d\\u00eda, pill\\u00e1ndonos a todos con la guardia baja con su incre\\u00edble calidad. Lo que recibimos fue un juego de acci\\u00f3n muy desenfadado, divertido y con much\\u00edsimo humor que convert\\u00eda la m\\u00fasica en el eje principal alrededor del que giraba todo, haci\\u00e9ndonos golpear, esquivar y realizar todo tipo de acciones al ritmo de su banda sonora. Una banda sonora que, por supuesto, ha hecho las delicias de los amantes del rock con canciones licenciadas de grupos como The Black Keys o Nine Inch Nails, aunque tampoco podemos restarle m\\u00e9ritos a sus composiciones originales, m\\u00e1s de 3 horas de temas de calidad compuestos para adaptarse a lo que ocurre en cada nivel, combate y situaci\\u00f3n de la aventura, creando as\\u00ed la fusi\\u00f3n perfecta entre m\\u00fasica y jugabilidad.\\n\\nBr\\u00fctal Legend\\n\\nHablar de Br\\u00fctal Legend es hacerlo del homenaje definitivo al heavy metal en forma de videojuego. La historia, la est\\u00e9tica, los personajes\\u2026 Todo desprende amor por este tipo de m\\u00fasica y la cultura que la rodea, y, como podr\\u00e9is suponer, su banda sonora no se qued\\u00f3 atr\\u00e1s. De hecho, a nivel musical es una aut\\u00e9ntica barbaridad, permiti\\u00e9ndonos disfrutar de una generosa selecci\\u00f3n de m\\u00e1s de 100 canciones en la que no falta la presencia de grandes iconos y abanderados del g\\u00e9nero como Judas Priest, Mot\\u00f6rhead, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, M\\u00f6tley Cr\\u00fce, Testament, KISS, In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, Megadeth, Def Leppard, Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson, Dragonforce y much\\u00edsimos m\\u00e1s. Sumadle que el propio juego, adem\\u00e1s de tener una propuesta jugable muy original y \\u00fanica, estaba genial y contaba con el mism\\u00edsimo Jack Black interpretando a su protagonista, y tendr\\u00e9is una obra imprescindible para cualquier amante del metal.\\n\\nDoom Eternal\\n\\nDoom es toda una leyenda de los videojuegos y aunque la saga estuvo un tiempo desaparecida en combate, volvi\\u00f3 con m\\u00e1s fuerza que nunca gracias a su entrega de 2016, un nuevo punto de partida con el que id Software convirti\\u00f3 el hecho de masacrar y despedazar demonios en todo un arte, algo que se llev\\u00f3 todav\\u00eda m\\u00e1s all\\u00e1 con su secuela, Doom Eternal. Pero si hay algo que podemos asegurar es que la acci\\u00f3n de estos juegos no ser\\u00eda igual de gratificante y satisfactoria sin su incre\\u00edble banda sonora, compuesta por Mick Gordon. Al ritmo del mejor exponente del metal industrial, los temazos que acompa\\u00f1aban los tiroteos eran capaces de subirnos la adrenalina a un nivel que muy pocos han llegado a alcanzar, consiguiendo que desat\\u00e1ramos nuestra bestia interior para dejarnos llevar por la brutalidad de sus combates mientras nos sumerg\\u00edamos en toda una sinfon\\u00eda de violencia, gore y v\\u00edsceras.Y todo ello por no hablar de la forma tan din\\u00e1mica en la que se comportaba para subir y bajar su intensidad seg\\u00fan lo que fuese ocurriendo. Si hemos escogido la secuela frente a su predecesor, es por el simple hecho de habernos ofrecido un m\\u00e1s y mejor en toda regla: m\\u00e1s canciones, m\\u00e1s fren\\u00e9ticas y con mayor pegada.\\n\\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance\\n\\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance es un juego que nunca est\\u00e1 m\\u00e1s de reivindicar. Al fin y al cabo, PlatinumGames nos deleit\\u00f3 con una fren\\u00e9tica y alocada aventura de acci\\u00f3n que cuenta con uno de los sistemas de parries m\\u00e1s satisfactorios que se han hecho nunca, algo a lo que debemos sumarle una puesta en escena que deja la boca abierta y unos jefes de los que marcan \\u00e9poca. De hecho, estos \\u00faltimos no ser\\u00edan lo mismo sin sus inolvidables temas vocales, los cuales confer\\u00edan una identidad muy marcada tanto a la batalla en s\\u00ed como al jefe en cuesti\\u00f3n. Todos ellos apostaban por una mezcla entre rock electr\\u00f3nico y metal que encajaba como un guante con el tono del juego, cumpliendo de sobra con su funci\\u00f3n de subirnos la adrenalina al m\\u00e1ximo al mismo tiempo que convert\\u00edan cada uno de estos duelos en una experiencia \\u00fanica y \\u00e9pica que jam\\u00e1s nos cansaremos de rejugar.\\n\\nKiller Instinct (2013)\\n\\nAunque no ha gozado de tanta popularidad como otros juegos de lucha, no se puede negar que el reinicio de Killer Instinct ha acabado por convertirse con el paso de los a\\u00f1os en una aut\\u00e9ntica maravilla que ning\\u00fan amante del g\\u00e9nero deber\\u00eda perderse. S\\u00ed, le llev\\u00f3 su tiempo alcanzar ese nivel, pero ahora mismo es una obra repleta de contenidos, espectacular, con un online de lujo y con una jugabilidad a prueba de bombas. Y s\\u00ed, es otro juego que le debe much\\u00edsimo a su banda sonora, uno de los mejores y m\\u00e1s variados trabajos de Mick Gordon, al menos durante sus dos primeras temporadas antes de que Celldweller y Atlas Plus tomaran el relevo con la tercera, con la cual se baj\\u00f3 ligeramente el list\\u00f3n.\\n\\nEn l\\u00edneas generales, estamos hablando de una banda sonora que juguetea con diferentes estilos, pero que suele tener el metal industrial muy presente para regalarnos unas composiciones absolutamente incre\\u00edbles que no solo destacan por lo extensas que son y su incuestionable calidad, sino tambi\\u00e9n por la forma en la que se comportan durante los enfrentamientos, aumentando su intensidad a medida que alargamos nuestros combos y reduci\\u00e9ndola cuando sufrimos un Combo Breaker, a\\u00f1adiendo incluso diferentes efectos que distorsionan el sonido seg\\u00fan lo requiera la situaci\\u00f3n. Os aseguramos que pocos juegos del g\\u00e9nero han conseguido que repartir guantazos sea una experiencia tan satisfactoria y no exageramos al decir que gran parte de la culpa de esto se la debemos a su m\\u00fasica.\\n\\nMetal: Hellsinger\\n\\nEn los \\u00faltimos a\\u00f1os se est\\u00e1n popularizando los juegos que combinan acci\\u00f3n y ritmo y uno de los mejores exponentes de esto lo tuvimos el a\\u00f1o pasado con el lanzamiento de Metal: Hellinger, un shooter en primera persona de sabor cl\\u00e1sico y con cierto regusto a las nuevas entregas de Doom que contaba con la peculiaridad de que deb\\u00edamos disparar, saltar, esquivar y movernos al ritmo de la canci\\u00f3n que sonase en cada nivel. Lo mejor era que si consegu\\u00edamos mantener el comp\\u00e1s y aumentar nuestro multiplicador de combos, el juego nos permit\\u00eda escuchar la parte vocal del tema en cuesti\\u00f3n, un incentivo excelente que consegu\\u00eda que quisi\\u00e9ramos jugar bien.\\n\\nSi decimos esto es porque a pesar de que la banda sonora es completamente original y fue compuesta en exclusiva para el t\\u00edtulo (la cual apuesta por el metal puro y duro), entre sus vocalistas nos encontr\\u00e1bamos a grandes estrellas de la talla de Serj Tankian (System of a Down), Matt Heafy (Trivium), Mikael Stanne (Dark Tranquillity), Randy Blythe (Lamb of God), Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy), Bj\\u00f6rn Strid (Soilwork) o Tatiana Shmailyuk (Jinjer). El resultado fue una banda sonora excepcional y de una calidad sobresaliente que hizo las delicias de cualquier amante del g\\u00e9nero, por lo que no pod\\u00eda faltar en esta lista.\\n\\nDevil May Cry 5\\n\\nDevil May Cry siempre ha sido una saga que ha destacado, adem\\u00e1s de por la calidad de su acci\\u00f3n, por sus bandas sonoras, capaces de adaptarse de maravilla a todo lo que vemos en pantalla para dispararnos la adrenalina al combatir con temas muy ca\\u00f1eros en los que el metal y el rock se llegan a combinar con otros g\\u00e9neros, algo que ha alcanzado su m\\u00e1xima expresi\\u00f3n con su quinta entrega numerada, un t\\u00edtulo que nos ha dejado para el recuerdo con algunas composiciones que han causado aut\\u00e9ntico furor, como \\\"Devil Trigger\\\" o \\\"Bury the Light\\\". Y al igual que otros t\\u00edtulos de esta lista, los temas de combate se comportaban de forma din\\u00e1mica, aumentando su intensidad a medida que increment\\u00e1bamos nuestro rango a base de realizar combos con estilo, un detalle que puede parecer simple pero que estaba espectacularmente ejecutado y que consegu\\u00eda que nos vini\\u00e9semos arriba al jugar bien. No hay muchas bandas sonoras capaces de servir como premio al jugador por su buen desempe\\u00f1o durante la partida, pero esta es, sin duda, una de ellas.\\n\\nGuilty Gear: Strive\\n\\nGuilty Gear es una saga que nunca ha escondido sus fuertes inspiraciones en el metal y el rock, con personajes que incluso deben sus nombres a grandes artistas, as\\u00ed que a nadie deber\\u00eda sorprender que este siempre haya sido el estilo musical que ha predominado en una serie que tiene ya un largo recorrido y una gran selecci\\u00f3n de temazos ic\\u00f3nicos. Sin embargo, en vez de escoger sus entregas cl\\u00e1sicas, hemos querido quedarnos con su juego m\\u00e1s reciente, Guilty Gear: Strive, para el cual Daisuke Ishiwatari nos ha deleitado los o\\u00eddos con una gran cantidad de temas vocales de lo m\\u00e1s ca\\u00f1eros que captan a la perfecci\\u00f3n la esencia de la serie y elevan el frenetismo y la intensidad habitual de sus batallas al siguiente nivel. Un trabajo impecable del que resulta imposible cansarse.\\n\\nLollipop Chainsaw\\n\\nQuiz\\u00e1 no sea el juego que esperabais encontrar en esta lista, pero hemos decidido incluirlo por su espectacular mezcla de temas licenciados y m\\u00fasica original. Por una parte, tenemos temazos de la talla de \\\"Nemesis\\\" de Arch Enemy o \\\"Heroes of Our Time\\\" de Dragonforce, mientras que por el otro Akira Yamaoka (el compositor habitual de Silent Hill) nos hace disfrutar con su particular estilo y forma de interpretar el rock con una serie de composiciones de la m\\u00e1s alta calidad que tienen su sello impreso, dej\\u00e1ndonos para el recuerdo una banda sonora impecable, muy bien escogida y con un uso magistral que dota de much\\u00edsima personalidad a cada una de las secciones del juego. Vale, s\\u00ed, cuenta con m\\u00e1s estilos, como el funk o el punk, pero cuando abraza el rock y el metal, brilla como ella sola.\\n\\nOtras menciones destacadas\\n\\nAl hablar de m\\u00fasica es imposible contentar a todo el mundo, ya que todos tenemos nuestros propios gustos y no es viable reducir a tan solo 13 juegos un legado musical tan extenso como el que nos ha dejado este hobby que tanto amamos, por eso vamos a intentar a\\u00f1adir algunas menciones destacadas para que la representaci\\u00f3n sea mayor.\\n\\nDe entrada, no podemos olvidarnos del remake de 2010 de Splatterhouse, un juego que dej\\u00f3 much\\u00edsimo que desear pero que hac\\u00eda gala de una banda sonora realmente buena que inclu\\u00eda temas de grupos como Lamb of God y Municipal Waste. Otro caso parecido lo tendr\\u00edamos en KISS: Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child, un mediocre t\\u00edtulo de acci\\u00f3n en primera persona abanderado por KISS, por lo que su banda sonora, desde luego, no fall\\u00f3.\\n\\nPor supuesto, dentro de los juegos musicales, tenemos que hacer una menci\\u00f3n obligatoria a Rock Band, la saga que le plant\\u00f3 cara a Guitar Hero con una serie de entregas que hicieron gala de una selecci\\u00f3n de temas licenciados potent\\u00edsimos donde no faltaron grupos de la talla de Metallica o Iron Maiden.\\n\\nLa serie Twisted Metal es otra que nos ha dejado buenas bandas sonoras marcadas por el metal, y la primera entrega de Quake tuvo su banda sonora compuesta por m\\u00e1s ni menos que Trent Reznor de Nine Inch Nails, dej\\u00e1ndonos para el recuerdo un tema principal muy ca\\u00f1ero e ic\\u00f3nico y unas composiciones que creaban un ambiente espeluznante.\\n\\nLas entregas 3D de Sonic tampoco son ajenas al rock y nos han dejado temazos muy memorables donde destacan especialmente los compuestos e interpretados por Crush 40, y Remedy es un estudio que suele colaborar con Poets of the Fall y que tiene juegos con niveles que giran en torno a alguno de sus temas, tal y como demostr\\u00f3 hace no mucho Control en su recta final.\\n\\nDe tem\\u00e1tica 100% metal hay ejemplos destacables como Slain: Back From Hell y Valfaris, y hay juego que cuentan en su haber con temas memorables de rock a pesar de no ser el estilo predominante de sus bandas sonoras, como bien demuestran t\\u00edtulos como Halo 2 y su m\\u00edtico \\\"Blow Me Away\\\". El g\\u00e9nero tambi\\u00e9n suele estar muy presente en los juegos de conducci\\u00f3n, por lo que tambi\\u00e9n podr\\u00edamos se\\u00f1alar sagas como Forza Horizon, Gran Turismo, Burnout o Need for Speed, aunque son bandas sonoras con una variedad de estilos muy amplia.\\n\\nPodr\\u00edamos seguir y seguir, pero llegados a este punto creemos que lo mejor es que nos dig\\u00e1is vosotros en los comentarios cu\\u00e1les son vuestras bandas sonoras y temas favoritos tanto de rock como de metal que hab\\u00e9is escuchado en un videojuego, as\\u00ed como aquellas menciones que hab\\u00e9is echado de menos. \\u00a1Os leemos!\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Siliconera\", \"author\": \"Jenni Lada\", \"title\": \"Guilty Gear Plush and Bridget Nendoroid Revealed\", \"description\": \"At Anime Expo 2023, Good Smile Company showed off the Guilty Gear Bridget Nendoroid and new plush of Baiken, Sol Badguy, Jack-O, and Ky Kiske.

Nestled high up in the mountains is Camp Damascus, the self-proclaimed \\u201cmost effective\\u201d gay conversion camp in the country. Here, a life free from sin awaits. But the secret behind that success is anything but holy. And they\\u2019ll scare you straight to hell.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019ve got no shadow,\\u201d Martina informs me, gazing down at my feet and then shifting her eyes back up to mine.\\n\\nI check, and sure enough my friend is largely correct. Thanks to the afternoon sun hanging directly overhead, it appears my shadow has mostly disappeared. It\\u2019s a subtle observation, a phenomenon you\\u2019d never really notice unless you were looking for it, and yet Martina has pointed it out with an excited grin.\\n\\nOf course, closer examination would reveal that my shadow, while small, is still there. Hawai\\u2019i is the only state where your shadows do completely disappear, and this rare event only happens twice a year. It\\u2019s called Lahaina Noon.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t say this, though.\\n\\nI think to ask why Martina is so excited about her flawed discovery, one that immediately falls apart after the slightest direct inspection, but I quickly realize I don\\u2019t have to. I too notice the little things Martina does, logging every tiny quirk of the world regardless of anyone else finding them worthy of comment. There are so many beautiful pieces in God\\u2019s grand puzzle, and they can pass you by if you\\u2019re not careful.\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, I guess you\\u2019re right,\\u201d I offer.\\n\\n\\u201cLike Peter Pan,\\u201d Martina continues, the smile curling wider across her overwhelmingly freckled face.\\n\\nWith anyone else, this unhinged friendliness might signal a touch of sarcasm lurking somewhere behind Martina\\u2019s large green eyes, but I know better. At least, I hope I do.\\n\\nI nod along, smiling happily despite suddenly finding myself in the pop culture deep end with little understanding of what she\\u2019s talking about. I\\u2019ve never read the book, nor seen any films related to this antique story with questionable motives. There\\u2019s enchantment involved, so I know enough to stay far, far away.\\n\\nFor a brief moment I consider telling Martina she shouldn\\u2019t read that stuff, that the only magic she needs is the love of Christ, but I hesitate.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve had these conversations before, and even in a town as God-fearing as Neverton, there\\u2019s only so many who want to hear it. Most Christian folks are friendly enough, but the second you start rubbing their faces in these little indiscretions they bristle.\\n\\nThe last thing I want to do is make Martina bristle.\\n\\n\\u201cDid you have to read that Freshman year?\\u201d she questions, clearly noting the pained expression on my face I\\u2019m so desperately struggling to avoid.\\n\\nI shake my head. \\u201cNo,\\u201d I reply flatly, rejecting explanation.\\n\\nThe truth is, I do remember Peter Pan being assigned in English class, and I remember the reports that accompanied this classic secular tale from James Matthew Barrie. I could easily tell you where the author was born (Scotland), how he died (pneumonia), or even let you in on the fact he killed off an equally profane and godless character, Sherlock Holmes, in a non-canon short story well before Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever had the chance.\\n\\nThese facts about the author create a window into his work, not a door. It\\u2019s a window I\\u2019ve never crawled through.\\n\\nIntentionally.\\n\\n\\u201cWeren\\u2019t you in my class?\\u201d Martina continues. \\u201cI thought everyone read it.\\u201d\\n\\nOnce again, I\\u2019m put to the test, reaching the familiar crossroads of how forthcoming I think I should be.\\n\\nI love Jesus, I really do, but Jesus would want me to be cool. He\\u2019d want Martina to think I was cool.\\n\\nKingdom of The Pine was founded on a tenet of practicality, after all.\\n\\nWhich brings me back to this conversation, and the sudden realization I\\u2019ve been standing in silence for way too long. I need an answer that will appease both a fellow student and the good Lord above, struggling to walk the razor\\u2019s edge between the truth of my deeply held convictions and the relaxed sheen of a perfectly normal girl.\\n\\nNot all Kingdom Kids are weird.\\n\\n\\u201cI didn\\u2019t think\\u2026 I mean\\u2026\\u201d I stammer, struggling to craft an excuse and coming up short as my mind tumbles and churns. \\u201cMy parents didn\\u2019t want me reading it,\\u201d I finally reply, submitting the truth and letting the chips fall where they may. \\u201cMagic, you know?\\u201d\\n\\nMartina\\u2019s already enormous green eyes widen in a visage of complete shock. \\u201cWait, really?\\u201d she blurts.\\n\\nMy friend\\u2019s expression is not what I expected, flooded by sudden excitement and genuine interest. I now realize she might be impressed by this moral objection, and my mind begins to race as I wonder if she\\u2019s proud of me.\\n\\nWell, not prideful but\\u2026 something like that.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve known Martina for a very long time, although we\\u2019ve only recently started talking in a meaningful way. Could she have similar convictions? Could this be the start of the deep, authentic friendship I\\u2019ve been hoping for?\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s fucked up,\\u201d Martina finally continues, immediately prompting me to pump the proverbial brakes on my enthusiasm. \\u201cThat\\u2019s way fucked up, Rose. I\\u2019m sorry your parents are so crazy.\\u201d\\n\\nI can\\u2019t help nodding along, the muscles of my neck taking on a life of their own.\\n\\n\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I reply, rolling my eyes. \\u201cWay\\u2026 messed up. Parents, right?\\u201d\\n\\nThe second these words leave my lips I feel the deep ache of regret, a guilty pang that shoots down my spine as a sinful reminder. God\\u2019s watchful eye has noticed.\\n\\nMartina smiles, though, and suddenly this regret is met with something else, a surge of joy that counteracts the holy venom like ANAVIP though the bloodstream of some poor soul who crossed a Pentecostal pit viper.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve gotta pull back on the snake handling.\\n\\n\\u201cAlright. See you at the bottom,\\u201d Martina continues.\\n\\nMy friend promptly turns and breaks into a run, sprinting with her bare feet across the short, rocky runway. It\\u2019s as though the frozen universe has started rolling on again, the rustle of the trees and the splash of water far, far below filling my ears.\\n\\nThe other kids who\\u2019ve gathered around these cliffs watch in amazement, their hair wet and stringy as towels drape across them for a fleeting moment of dryness before the next brave leap. Everyone here is used to jumpers taking their time for a big show, standing at the edge of the cliff for a good while and gazing down as though considering their surrender. Of course, once they\\u2019ve gotten to the rocky ledge they rarely back down, and everyone watching knows this. It\\u2019s all part of the performance, a temporary ringmaster gathering as many eyes as possible before rushing to the edge and hurling themselves over. They tumble down into the cool water below with a mighty splash, followed by excited cheers from their brief but adoring fans.\\n\\nMartina doesn\\u2019t need any of that.\\n\\n\\u201cFuck!\\u201d she cries out as she springs from the rocks, her body rocketing forward while arms and legs continue pumping in the air. I can see the exact point that gravity catches hold of her body, gripping tight and then yanking downward in a sharp change of trajectory that would make Newton proud.\\n\\nI lose sight of Martina\\u2019s long strawberry curls as she drops, but I\\u2019m too frightened to rush to the edge and witness her plummet. Seconds after disappearing from view there\\u2019s a loud splash, followed by a joyful eruption from the crowd. Their applause carries out through the forest around us, washing through the trees like audible water.\\n\\nCarefully, I creep to the edge and stare down into the swimming hole that lies below, the dark water still rippling from Martina\\u2019s plunge. A few sunbathers lay out on the shore nearby in various states of undress, many of them less covered up than I\\u2019m comfortable with, and a handful of swimmers float at the outer rim of this dazzling natural pool.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a hot day in Montana, so the falls are packed.\\n\\nI continue gazing, waiting for Martina to resurface as my heart rate needlessly quickens. She\\u2019s done this jump hundreds of times, and it appears none of them have resulted in disaster so far. There\\u2019s no logical reason for Martina to have any trouble this time around, but as I stare down at the reflective surface below, I can\\u2019t help the tiny seed of fear that blossoms at the pit of my stomach.\\n\\nFor some reason I\\u2019ve found myself caring a lot about how things turn out for her. It feels, in a word, weird.\\n\\nThankfully, a wave of relief pulses through my body as Martina breaks the surface, taking in a big gulp of air and instinctively whipping her red hair from side to side. She begins swimming gracefully across the water, making her way to the shore.\\n\\nFrom up here I can see her body move in a completely new light, propelling herself forward with majestic elegance. She looks like a frog as she kicks her legs, but that comparison sounds brash and awkward, while Martina is nothing of the sort.\\n\\n\\u201cYou gonna give it a shot?\\u201d a voice abruptly questions from behind, breaking my focus and causing a startled breath to catch in my throat.\\n\\nI turn around to find my friend Seth, his shirtless body already deeply tanned in the afternoon sun. His hair is still wet from the last leap, and I have no doubt he\\u2019d love to make another running launch off this cliffside. However, Seth has taken a moment away from his own madcap antics to nurture my growth as a future daredevil.\\n\\n\\u201cI was thinking about it,\\u201d I admit.\\n\\nSeth cracks a smile. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not as hard as it looks. I mean, we\\u2019re only thirty feet up. You\\u2019re not gonna die.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPeople died while jumping here in 1977, 1980, and 2016,\\u201d I inform him. \\u201cSo\\u2026 it\\u2019s possible.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh,\\u201d Seth replies, his enthusiasm abruptly deflating. He narrows his eyes as a confused expression crosses his face, suddenly faced with this unexpected kernel of self-doubt.\\n\\nThe average speed of a dive is 15 feet per second. Therefore, a swimming hole between 10 and 15 feet deep could paralyze you in less than a second.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t mention this.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re still not going to die,\\u201d I assure him. \\u201cThe chances of fatal injury are phenomenally low. If you want to increase your survival odds, just make sure you jump feet first. Never dive.\\u201d\\n\\nSeth nods along as I pull him back into mental alignment.\\n\\n\\u201cPlus, God\\u2019s watching over you,\\u201d I continue.\\n\\nSeth smiles a toothy, all-American grin. My friend reaches out and places a hand on my shoulder in a gesture of reassurance, but lingers there a little longer than I might\\u2019ve expected. \\u201cAmen.\\u201d\\n\\nFinally, I let out an awkward laugh and my friend removes his hand.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s see it then,\\u201d Seth continues, nodding toward the cliff\\u2019s edge. \\u201cWhat you got, Rose?\\u201d\\n\\nSeth backs away and motions for the other kids up here to clear a path. They\\u2019re waiting and watching now, their eyes trained on me in anticipation of the leap to come.\\n\\nNine out of ten accidents occur when people are playing near the water\\u2019s edge, not when they\\u2019re focused on jumping in.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve got this.\\n\\nI pull off my long dress and toss it to the side, revealing the most decidedly modest, black one-piece I could find online. Unlike Martina, however, I\\u2019m not yet comfortable enough to flip myself into oblivion without a good look below.\\n\\nI know I\\u2019ll be fine, that most of the danger here is nothing but an illusion, but my brain understanding this is one thing and my body appropriately reacting is another. My heart is slamming hard within my chest, thundering away as a sizzling hot tingle makes its way across my skin.\\n\\nThis is your fight or flight response. Your sympathetic nervous system is releasing catecholamines and making you hyper aware of your surroundings.\\n\\nThe solution, of course, is grounding and prayer.\\n\\nI spend a moment observing the scene around me, taking in faces on every side of the watering hole. Across the way, on the opposite cliff, even more of my peers watch with excitement and anticipation.\\n\\nThe Lord is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?\\n\\nSome people come here to jump, others just wanna be a part of something. As the school year comes to an end and we all prepare to leap from our own metaphorical cliffs into adulthood, it\\u2019s easy to get restless. We\\u2019re all pretending it\\u2019s mid-summer and we\\u2019re finally free, despite the fact that tomorrow we\\u2019ll be right back to the Monday grind.\\n\\nI get the distinct feeling I\\u2019m living in what will someday be a fond memory.\\n\\nWith that, I command my foot to take its first step toward the edge.\\n\\nMy body refuses to move.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Lord is my light and my salvation,\\u201d I repeat. I take a deep breath and center myself once more, focused on compelling my body forward.\\n\\nStill, nothing.\\n\\nI remain motionless, staring out at a sea of classmates on the opposite cliffside while they gaze back at this curious standoff between mind and body.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not so bad once you start running,\\u201d Seth says from behind. \\u201cOnce you reach the edge, the hard part is over.\\u201d\\n\\nHis words are kind, and I appreciate this vote of confidence, but in a practical sense it does absolutely nothing. I\\u2019m displaying textbook freezing behavior, and Seth has no more control over my basolateral amygdala than I do.\\n\\nSuddenly, another familiar voice chimes in, hooting like a baseball coach from the dugout. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go, Rose!\\u201d\\n\\nI glance over to find Martina has already climbed back up, soaking wet with a towel wrapped tight around her body. Our eyes meet and she smiles warmly, immediately melting away the anxiety and fear that had paralyzed me with its icy grip. She winks.\\n\\nI grin back, basking in this feeling for a moment, then return my focus to the cliff.\\n\\nFeeling renewed, I prepare a third attempt at compelling myself forward, but before I get the chance my gaze falls onto something strange across the ravine. The other side of the cliffs is fairly close, some 40 feet across with a small waterfall carving its way down the middle in a never-ending cascade. Fellow classmates in their colorful swimwear line the opposite edge, but tucked back into the forest is another figure that watches with stoic intensity.\\n\\nI squint a bit, struggling to parse whether my eyes are playing tricks on me through the shady wood.\\n\\nA frighteningly pale woman is standing in the forest, her hair long and black as it hangs limply over her face and around her boney shoulders. It appears she\\u2019s staring directly at me, but it\\u2019s difficult to tell because her eyes lack irises or pupils. They\\u2019re solid white globes.\\n\\nThe woman is smiling, her expression frozen and her teeth unusually stained with dark brown and black smears. The incisors themselves are crooked and long, as though her gums have receded to provide an unnatural length.\\n\\nYet, despite all of this, the strangest thing about the woman\\u2019s appearance is what she\\u2019s wearing. She sports a deep red polo shirt with a stark white name tag pinned to the chest. It\\u2019s the kind of top you\\u2019d expect to see worn by someone arriving to fix your wireless internet or telling you which aisle to check at a department store. She also wears a thick metal band around her neck, which is pulled tight like a collar.\\n\\n\\u201cUh\\u2026 do you see that?\\u201d I question, whispering to Seth as my gaze remains fixed on the woman in the woods.\\n\\nAcross the way, nobody seems to notice this peculiar figure, despite the fact that she\\u2019s standing no more than 10 feet behind them in the underbrush.\\n\\n\\u201cSee what?\\u201d Seth asks.\\n\\nI point to the other side of the swimming hole, but just as Seth follows my gesture the eerie woman steps back into the lush Montana forest, disappearing just as quickly as she arrived.\\n\\nI peer into the shadows, struggling to catch sight of her but coming up empty.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a woman over there,\\u201d I continue. \\u201cShe looked\\u2026 kinda off.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOff how?\\u201d Seth counters.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d I reply, then shake my head as though this futile gesture might clear out the cobwebs. I certainly don\\u2019t intend to make a scene out of some poor old woman who happens to appear, well, frightening.\\n\\nMaybe she\\u2019s sick.\\n\\n\\u201cCould\\u2019ve been someone\\u2019s mom checking in on them,\\u201d I suggest, offering this explanation more to myself than to Seth.\\n\\n\\u201cI really don\\u2019t see anything,\\u201d he says, genuinely apologetic, then lowers his voice a bit. \\u201cHey, if you don\\u2019t wanna jump, it\\u2019s all good.\\u201d\\n\\nSomeone else steps up next to us, a girl I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s anxious to get things going again. \\u201cAre you gonna jump?\\u201d she questions, deeply annoyed.\\n\\nI glance around to find a line has formed behind me, folks waiting their turn while I stare off into space and let my imagination run wild.\\n\\n\\u201cOh, sorry,\\u201d I stammer, stepping back.\\n\\nMartina isn\\u2019t as receptive. \\u201cChill out, she\\u2019s getting ready,\\u201d my friend retorts angrily from the sideline.\\n\\nIt takes a moment for me to regain focus, but soon enough I\\u2019m returning to my former position and following Martina\\u2019s lead.\\n\\nI push away any thoughts of that curious lady in the woods, or the height of this drop, or the fact that school is ending and life is waiting for me with wide open jaws like the whale ready to swallow Jonah whole. Instead, I focus on the simple act of putting one foot before the next.\\n\\nI take one final look at Martina, just about ready to step forward when something startling and warm slips between my fingers.\\n\\nGlancing down, I find that Seth is gripping my hand in his, an unexpected gesture of friendship.\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019ll jump together,\\u201d Seth offers.\\n\\nI was about to go on my own, but a little more support couldn\\u2019t hurt.\\n\\nA strange coo falls from the lips of everyone watching, a sound I\\u2019m not quite sure what to make of as expressions shift into knowing smiles and glances are exchanged across this cliffside and the next.\\n\\nI begin to recite a short verse under my breath, repeating it to myself over and over again in quiet anticipation. \\u201cIt is the Lord who marches before you; he will be with you and will never fail you. It is the Lord who marches before you; he will be with you and will never fail you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGo on three,\\u201d Seth proclaims. \\u201cOne. Two. Three!\\u201d\\n\\nWe take off down the short runway, our feet thundering against the dirt until there\\u2019s no ground left to slam against. I push off with my final step and erupt into the air, unable to keep myself from crying out with a long scream of equal parts fear and excitement.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a few precious moments of high school left, but this one feels like the pinnacle of summer.\\n\\nAn electric tingle surges across my frame as gravity catches hold, Seth and I plummeting toward the deep blue below. It\\u2019s a strange sensation that my brain immediately struggles to analyze and dissect, but before I get the chance to understand it fully I\\u2019m slamming into the cool water.\\n\\nMy senses are swallowed by darkness, the sound of the world around me sucking inward and holding tight as I struggle to find my bearings. I\\u2019m still plummeting, just slower now, and for a brief moment my feet touch the welcome clay of the riverbed below. I push back against the bottom and swim up in a cascade of tiny bubbles, finally breaking the surface once again.\\n\\nThe resulting rush is incredible, my body fresh and rejuvenated in a way that I didn\\u2019t quite expect.\\n\\nThat was my first jump ever; a welcome baptism.\\n\\nI run fingers through my long blonde hair, pushing it away from my face as I spit out some of the water that managed to force its way down my throat. As I sputter and cough, Seth emerges next to me in the dark pool.\\n\\n\\u201cYou alright, Rose?\\u201d he asks, chuckling as he watches me awkwardly pull myself together.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m amazing,\\u201d I reply. \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe I just did that! God is good!\\u201d\\n\\nSeth is unable to keep himself from smiling even wider as we tread water next to one another, savoring the unexpected calm that\\u2019s preceded such a gaudy stunt.\\n\\nSilence falls, bathing the scene in an awkward hush.\\n\\nI was so relaxed and now this is tense. Why is this tense?\\n\\nFinally, I just can\\u2019t take it anymore. I splash some water in Seth\\u2019s face and let the tension deflate with a good-hearted laugh.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m going again,\\u201d I announce before slipping below the surface and swimming toward the rocky shore nearby.\\n\\n***\\n\\nAs we drive home in Seth\\u2019s old Jeep, I can\\u2019t help but notice the way his eyes dance across the heating panel of his center console, focused on a lever that sits precariously shifted to the blazing hot side. I get the feeling Seth is struggling to tell me something \\u2013 or maybe he wants me to ask something of him? \\u2013 but he\\u2019s too afraid.\\n\\nTruth be told, this is becoming a theme with Seth, and I just can\\u2019t figure out why. We\\u2019ve been close for a long time, and I\\u2019ve always appreciated the way he\\u2019s there for me through thick and thin, a reliable shoulder to cry on and a source of great Christian companionship on these long days.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d I finally ask.\\n\\nSeth plays dumb, glancing over from the driver\\u2019s seat as his vehicle rumbles onward. The trees of the forest have finally started giving way, revealing the modest suburban homes of Neverton.\\n\\nTucked against the side of a horseshoe-shaped mountain range, these foothills feel distinctly separate from the rest of the world. While a vast landscape of rolling golden farmlands extend to the east, the majority of this county is swathed in mysterious, evergreen forest, hiding our hamlet like a secret as looming peaks rise beyond.\\n\\nI recognize every intricate step of this route, the signs and sidewalks etched into the depths of my soul. It\\u2019s a humble Montana town of 15,000 locals, so finding your way around isn\\u2019t much of an accomplishment, but it certainly makes you notice when your driver isn\\u2019t paying attention.\\n\\n\\u201cThat was the turn,\\u201d I remind him, charting a route we\\u2019d traveled a thousand times before. \\u201cJust get the next one.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSorry,\\u201d Seth apologizes, shaking his head and wiping his brow. He glances at the heater once again. \\u201cYou sure you want it that warm?\\u201d\\n\\nI notice now that he\\u2019s getting a little red, sweating as the car continues to fill with hot air.\\n\\n\\u201cAre you feeling okay?\\u201d I ask.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s\\u2026 really hot in here,\\u201d Seth finally cuts to the chase. \\u201cDo you mind if I turn the heat down?\\u201d\\n\\nI nod.\\n\\nLately, it feels as though I can\\u2019t warm up for the life of me, trapped in a state of frigid discomfort for hours at a time. It comes without warning, and the curious part of my mind wonders if this might be a symptom of a larger medical issue.\\n\\nIt hasn\\u2019t been worth bringing up with my parents yet, because by the time I\\u2019m irritated enough to do something about this sensation the chill has thawed.\\n\\nI say nothing as Seth adjusts the temperature slightly. He furrows his brow a bit, confused. \\u201cNow I\\u2019m cold,\\u201d he announces with a chuckle.\\n\\nMy teeth are starting to chatter, but I remain silent as I place my backpack over my lap to retain a morsel of heat.\\n\\n\\u201cLong day, huh?\\u201d Seth continues, giving the temperature adjustment a rest.\\n\\nI nod, gazing out the window as a slate of familiar faces pass us by. I recognize most of the folks strolling around this evening; joyful, God-fearing families out for brisk walks as they enjoy a flourishing purple sunset above.\\n\\n\\u201cI really like spending time with you,\\u201d Seth declares.\\n\\nI glance back at my friend, appreciating the sincerity of his words. \\u201cThanks. You too.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou too?\\u201d he repeats back, as if my reply needs more explanation.\\n\\n\\u201cI really like spending time with you, too,\\u201d I clarify. \\u201cYou\\u2019re a good friend.\\u201d\\n\\nSeth appears confused by my response, but I don\\u2019t know what else he wants from me. I\\u2019d love to dive deep and figure out what\\u2019s going on with him, but right now I\\u2019m partially distracted by just how ravenously hungry I\\u2019ve become. Seth wasn\\u2019t kidding when he mentioned the length of the day, and after five or six cliff jumps and subsequent climbs back to the top, I\\u2019ve found myself yearning for the sweet relief of fat and sugar in my bloodstream.\\n\\nThankfully, Mom and Dad assured me dinner would be waiting when I got home.\\n\\nWe ride in silence a while longer before Seth reaches out and readjusts the heater, pushing forth the warm air once again and bending to my wishes.\\n\\n\\u201cThanks,\\u201d I chuckle graciously.\\n\\n\\u201cNo problem,\\u201d Seth replies, strangely taciturn.\\n\\nEventually, Seth pulls up to my house, his Jeep turning into the gravel driveway and slowly rolling to a stop with a satisfying crunch.\\n\\n\\u201cThank you for driving,\\u201d I offer, anxious to get inside for dinner.\\n\\nI throw off my seatbelt and double-check that my backpack and towel are in tow. Swiftly, I throw open the vehicle door and offer a slight wave goodbye before hopping out and slamming it shut behind me, then hurry up the front walk.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve only make it a few steps before another loud metallic slam answers my own. Curious, I turn and discover Seth has climbed from the driver\\u2019s seat and is marching after me.\\n\\n\\u201cRose!\\u201d he calls out.\\n\\nI wait up, and soon enough we are standing face-to-face. There\\u2019s an intensity to his gaze, a tidal wave of emotion welling up within my friend. I can sense the impending cascade of feelings, but it\\u2019s shape and tone remain abstract.\\n\\nI have no idea what Seth could possibly want.\\n\\nMy friend doesn\\u2019t say a word, just stares at me blankly as unknown thoughts spiral through his mind. I\\u2019ve seen this expression a lot lately, but today it has grown to a boiling point and, to be perfectly frank, it\\u2019s starting to frighten me.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d I demand.\\n\\nSeth leans forward and kisses me on the lips, a swift movement that\\u2019s met with my immediate repulsion.\\n\\nI pull my neck away in alarm and confusion as our faces briefly meet and then quickly part. My mind is struggling to keep up, desperately piecing together what just happened.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d I blurt. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t\\u2026 that was\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, I-I thought\\u2013 \\u201d Seth stammers.\\n\\nGradually, the true nature of this moment falls into place with breathtaking clarity.\\n\\nI shake my head, my lips tightly sealed as I let this gesture do the talking.\\n\\n\\u201cSo, you\\u2019re not\\u2026?\\u201d Seth is still having trouble completing a sentence.\\n\\n\\u201cDefinitely not,\\u201d I reply.\\n\\n\\u201cBut, I thought,\\u201d he repeats, a surprisingly meek moment for this typically stalwart guy.\\n\\n\\u201cNope,\\u201d I say, as my head continues to shake from side to side.\\n\\nSeth takes a moment to straighten up, processing this information in a state of awkward rigidity. I can tell he\\u2019s fighting some powerful internal battle, struggling to calm down.\\n\\nSuddenly, he turns and begins the march back to his car. Before making his way around to the driver\\u2019s side, however, Seth erupts in a startling display of violence as he punches the passenger door.\\n\\nI jump as the Jeep makes a hollow metallic thump, startled at first and then concerned for Seth\\u2019s hand.\\n\\nThat probably hurt.\\n\\nSeth doesn\\u2019t react to the pain. Instead, he stomps around the vehicle and climbs inside, slamming the door behind him. He starts his car and hits the gas, peeling onto the road in reverse and scattering gravel everywhere.\\n\\nI watch in silence, still not sure how to react as Seth\\u2019s Jeep disappears down the road.\\n\\nEventually, the front door opens behind me and my father sticks his head out, his chiseled jaw and familiar black-framed glasses shadowed in the dying light of day.\\n\\n\\u201cWas that Seth?\\u201d he calls out. \\u201cYou should\\u2019ve asked him to stay for dinner.\\u201d\\n\\nSeconds later, my father realizes the porch light is off and makes an awkward humph sound that it seems only dads are capable of. He quickly flips a switch, illuminating the scene.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s my girl,\\u201d he says.\\n\\nI solemnly retreat to my father, still completely silent as I wrap my arms around him in a warm embrace. We stand like this for a moment, allowing his protective paternal aura to envelope me, then I finally pull back as my stomach gurgles.\\n\\nI can already smell the garlic spaghetti sauce as it bubbles and churns on our kitchen stove, thrilled my mom opted for pasta this evening.\\n\\nMy father, Luke Darling, is a kind-eyed man with dark features and thick glasses that make him look like Superman. Of course, just like Peter Pan, I\\u2019ve never actually read a Superman comic, but the cultural relevance of this secular hero has somehow permeated my life.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s concerning. Jesus Christ is the only true superhero.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m so hungry,\\u201d I announce.\\n\\n\\u201cHi, So Hungry. I\\u2019m Dad\\u201d my father retorts, prompting a playful groan to escape my throat.\\n\\nWe head inside and I immediately find myself bathed in spiritual warmth, a cozy sensation that fills the pit of my stomach and causes the ice in my veins to melt away. That cold, lingering chill has finally taken its leave, disappearing with such little fanfare I hardly remember it was there in the first place.\\n\\nMy mother, Lisa, greets me in the kitchen with a loud and excited wail. \\u201cRose!\\u201d she cries out as though I\\u2019ve been gone for years, a sauce-covered wooden spoon gripped tight in her hand. \\u201cMy baby is back!\\u201d\\n\\nMom wraps her arms around me and plants a firm kiss on my cheek. When she pulls away, she immediately motions to the dining room table, coaxing me toward my place setting at the end.\\n\\n\\u201cHope you\\u2019re hungry,\\u201d she continues. \\u201cI made spaghetti.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI can smell that,\\u201d I reply warmly, \\u201cwith extra garlic.\\u201d\\n\\nMy parents exchange excited glances, thrilled by this culinary transgression. We\\u2019re being bad tonight.\\n\\nMom is always well put together, but this evening she\\u2019s looking especially done up with a lime green dress and a string of pearls around her neck. If the church allowed her to sport earrings there\\u2019s no doubt she\\u2019d have massive stones in either lobe.\\n\\nEven Mom\\u2019s makeup is less subtle than usual, a little extra red in the tone of her lips that she wouldn\\u2019t dare try if we were leaving the house this evening, and her stark blonde hair is held back with a white band across the top of her head. She\\u2019s a small woman but full of energy, and tonight her natural beauty is on full display.\\n\\nPeople say we look alike, and right now I can truly appreciate what a compliment that is.\\n\\nI take my seat at the end of the table while my mother continues to move back and forth across the kitchen, hard at work as she guides this meal across the finish line with radiant enthusiasm.\\n\\nEventually, my father makes his way over and sits down next to me, a peculiar look in his eye. He\\u2019s staring like he\\u2019s got something to say, an amused smirk just barely visible at the corners of his mouth.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat?\\u201d I question.\\n\\n\\u201cI see the light of the Lord in you tonight,\\u201d my father informs me, a compliment I\\u2019d take to heart if not for the fact this loving message feels tethered to something I don\\u2019t understand.\\n\\nSeconds later, mom is setting down an enormous dish of spaghetti before us, steam rolling off the bright red sauce as it floods our nostrils with robust aroma.\\n\\n\\u201cLuke!\\u201d my mother blurts playfully. \\u201cGive her a moment!\\u201d\\n\\nMy dad smiles and leans back in his chair, still eyeing me mischievously.\\n\\n\\u201cOkay, what\\u2019s going on here?\\u201d I glance back and forth between them as my mother takes her seat.\\n\\nMy query goes ignored as our conversation takes a sudden intermission, Luke and Lisa reaching their hands out to take my palms in theirs as we lower or heads. Nobody has to say a word as the three of us fall into our nightly routine.\\n\\nWe offer our prayer in unison, eyes shut tight as these words bounce from our mouths in a familiar cadence. \\u201cBless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts, which we are about to receive from Thy bounty, through Christ our Lord. Bless us so that we may know our place in his kingdom as servants. Bless us so that we may give service to the Lord and the righteous lambs will be spared when the scale of ends meets the scale of means. Bless the Kingdom of the Pine for lighting the darkened path that our Shepard walks. Amen.\\u201d\\n\\nI begin to lift my gaze, but before I get the chance my father launches into an additional blessing. He\\u2019s clearly caught the spirit this evening. \\u201cAnd bless the Prophet Cobel, for the wisdom he has bestowed. Bless the Four Tenets that guide us. But, most of all, bless our beautiful daughter on this important day. Amen.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAmen,\\u201d my mother and I respond in turn.\\n\\nThe three of us lift our gaze once more, taking a beat before getting to work and dishing out some pasta.\\n\\nLisa can\\u2019t help but chuckle to herself. \\u201cMost of all,\\u201d she repeats, shaking her head. \\u201cDon\\u2019t get cute, Luke.\\u201d\\n\\nShe\\u2019s referring to the part where my father placed my blessing above the Four Tenets and the Prophet Cobel. This is bad form and I\\u2019m a little bothered by it, but we\\u2019re playing it fast and loose tonight.\\n\\nAll I can do is refrain from pride and do better when it\\u2019s my turn to lead.\\n\\nThe third tenet: I will strive when my sin is heavy.\\n\\n\\u201cSo,\\u201d Mom begins, curiosity overwhelming her tone and elevating it into a playful sing-song frequency. \\u201cHow was your date?\\u201d\\n\\nI raise an eyebrow as I stab the mass of noodles before me, utterly confused. I begin to twirl my utensil. \\u201cWhat date?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWith Seth!\\u201d\\n\\nI can\\u2019t help but laugh. \\u201cAt the falls today?\\u201d I question. \\u201cIt was fun, but that wasn\\u2019t a date. We\\u2019re just friends.\\u201d\\n\\nThe cold chill I\\u2019d felt earlier immediately surges through my body, causing my hand to seize up and my body to shift awkwardly in the hard wooden chair.\\n\\nMy parents exchange glances again, as though passing some unspoken relay baton between them. My father clears his throat for a moment, ready to take over.\\n\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s a handsome guy, don\\u2019t you think?\\u201d Dad suggests.\\n\\nI shrug. \\u201cI mean, sure.\\u201d\\n\\nMom butts in, unable to go more than a single question and answer before leaping back into the fray. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t like that?\\u201d she demands to know. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want a boyfriend?\\u201d\\n\\nI raise my eyebrows, shocked by the statement.\\n\\nWe all love Jesus in the Darling household, but my parents are typically the ones who hoist this flag the highest and elevate my faith on a daily basis. I\\u2019m thankful to have two spiritual warriors consistently by my side, and through their pious diligence I\\u2019ve come to carry my own innate parental severity.\\n\\nThe idea of them actually encouraging me to have a boyfriend is shocking. I suppose my recent birthday could be the marker they were waiting for all along, but the turn they\\u2019ve taken is so alarming I\\u2019m left wondering if it\\u2019s a trap.\\n\\n\\u201cI think I should be focused on school right now,\\u201d I offer, hoping this is what they want to hear.\\n\\nMy mother reaches out and places her hand over mine, causing me to return a fresh spool of spaghetti to the plate.\\n\\n\\u201cHoney,\\u201d she begins softly. \\u201cThe Lord wants you to start a family. You\\u2019re a woman now, and finding a partner is a very important part of His plan. I know we\\u2019ve been a little\\u2026 strict about this before, but you should know it\\u2019s okay.\\u201d\\n\\nI\\u2019m not sure how to react, staring down at the table before me.\\n\\nMy father clears his throat, a sign he\\u2019s about to launch into a brief diatribe of religious theory. \\u201cYou know, when Tobias Cobel established the four tenets he did so in a way that was pretty genius. A lot of people see him as a man of faith and entrepreneurship, which he was, but he was also a family man.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTenet number four: excellence,\\u201d my mother chimes in. \\u201cI will preserver when my body does not.\\u201d\\n\\nI already know where they\\u2019re going with this, but I honor the moment and listen respectfully.\\n\\n\\u201cLiving on,\\u201d Dad continues. \\u201cThat could mean your spirit ascends to heaven, or that a business you\\u2019ve built keeps turning a profit. It could also mean your family line lives on.\\u201d\\n\\nI nod. \\u201cUnderstood,\\u201d is all I can think to say.\\n\\n\\u201cYou like Seth, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d my mother pushes, repeating her initial question. \\u201cBill and Anna tell us he\\u2019s really into you.\\u201d\\n\\nI now realize any denial regarding this supposed date will promptly be discarded and we\\u2019ll be taking another spin around the maypole. Clearly, there\\u2019s an answer my parents want to hear, and if I hope to enjoy this plate of spaghetti I\\u2019ll have to give it to them.\\n\\nStill, I refuse to lie. That\\u2019s a sin.\\n\\n\\u201cToday was good,\\u201d I reply, stretching my enthusiasm as far as it can possibly go. \\u201cSeth is really\\u2026 nice.\\u201d\\n\\nImmediately, the tension in my mother\\u2019s hand softens. She releases her grip as both of my parents sit back in their chairs, finally allowing a moment of rest.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t look up as I eat, but from the corner of my eye I see them watching with absolute satisfaction. They\\u2019re not even touching their food, just allowing the gratitude to wash over them as though I\\u2019m a toddler who finally learned to walk.\\n\\nEventually, the evening kicks back into gear and my parents plunge into their food. It seems my simple answer was just enough to satisfy whatever they were looking for.\\n\\nStill, a host of questions continue to linger in the back of my mind. Why were they talking to Seth\\u2019s parents about our day at the falls? Everyone in Neverton is pretty closely knit, especially members of the congregation, but as far as I knew Bill and Anna didn\\u2019t have a strong report with my folks.\\n\\nI try letting it slide and moving on, but the circumstances of this meeting remain firmly planted within my mind, unable to budge no matter how diligent my attempts to slip past.\\n\\nFinally, I turn back to my mother, my curiosity getting the better of me.\\n\\nI open my mouth to speak, but instead of any tangible words spilling from my throat, I find myself erupting with an unexpected cough.\\n\\nInstinctively, I reach for the tall glass of water on the table next to me, swiftly downing the cool liquid and trying again. However, this time I\\u2019m met with the same result at an even larger scale.\\n\\nSomething\\u2019s tickling the back of my throat, flooding me with frustration as I struggle to speak or even breathe. I begin to cough harder as expressions of grave concern wash across my parent\\u2019s faces.\\n\\n\\u201cAre you alright, hon?\\u201d Dad asks.\\n\\nA sudden, final cough unblocks my throat as air pumps forcefully from within, blasting forth the arbiter of my discomfort in a singular heave.\\n\\nI gag slightly, struggling to collect myself as my father pats me on the back with loving grace. \\u201cSomething go down the wrong pipe?\\u201d he asks with a chuckle.\\n\\nI nod, taking another long sip from my water glass. I gaze down at the plate of spaghetti before me, hoping to find the culprit and gasping abruptly \\u2013 nearly choking all over again.\\n\\nA small black fly wriggles atop my pasta, slathered in sauce as it hopelessly flits its wings in a futile attempt to escape.\\n\\n\\u201cOh my word,\\u201d my mother blurts, leaning forward a bit to get a better look.\\n\\nMy father does the same, adjusting his glasses as he struggles to take in this tiny, unexpected guest.\\n\\nThe whole family is silent for a moment, reeling.\\n\\n\\u201cMust\\u2019ve accidently swallowed the poor thing,\\u201d Dad suggests.\\n\\nI open my mouth to reply, but this simple movement causes an abrupt spasm to overwhelm my throat. I let out a loud, animalistic hurl as a cascade of black erupts from deep within me, pouring though my esophagus and spilling across the plate.\\n\\nThe upheaval is so sudden that my parents nearly fall backwards in their chairs, letting out cries of alarm as they instinctually push away.\\n\\nWhen this projectile finally ends, I stare down in utter horror, my body trembling as my mind races to understand the bizarre, squirming mass that\\u2019s now heaped onto my pasta and scattered across the table.\\n\\nThis black pile is churning and moving, crawling over itself as tiny wings flutter and miniature legs kick the air. I let out a scream as I realize this is not some toxic liquid but a dark porridge of living creatures, little flies born deep within my body before their sudden expulsion.\\n\\nExcerpted from Camp Damascus, copyright \\u00a9 2023 by Chuck Tingle\\n\\nExcerpt originally appeared on Tor.com in September 2022\"}, {\"source_name\": \"4Players Portal\", \"author\": null, \"title\": \"Steam Summer Sale: 5 abgedrehte Empfehlungen f\\u00fcr Japano-Fans\", \"description\": \"Im Steam Summer Sale finden sich Spiele aus allen Ecken der Welt und wer gerne Titeln aus dem Land der aufgehenden Sonne fr\\u00f6nt, der braucht nicht unbedingt lange suchen.\\n\\u00a0\\nDoch weil sich zwischen allseits bekannten und oft empfohlenen Spielen wie Persona 5 Ro\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.4players.de/4players.php/spielinfonews/PC-CDROM/3693/2205257/Steam-5_abgedrehte_Empfehlungen_fuer_Japano-Fans_im_Summer_Sale.html\", \"text\": \"Catherine Classic\\n\\nEntwickler: Atlus\\n\\nAtlus Preis: 4,99 Euro (75 Prozent Rabatt)\\n\\n4,99 Euro (75 Prozent Rabatt) Link zur Steam-Produktseite\\n\\nNieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139...\\n\\nEntwickler: Square Enix, Toylogic Inc.\\n\\nSquare Enix, Toylogic Inc.

Irgendwobefinden sich, mal bunt, mal ernst und immer sch\\u00f6n abgedreht.Wer den Namen \\u201eAtlus\\u201c h\\u00f6rt, der denkt vermutlich als Erstes an Persona oder Shin Megami Tensei. Doch dass die japanische Spieleschmiede auch was anderes kann als rundenbasierte Rollenspiele, bewies man 2011 mit dem Release von. Die abgedrehtel\\u00e4sst euch in die schl\\u00fcpfrigen Sohlen von Vincent h\\u00fcpfen, der mit seiner Freundin Katherine eigentlich eine gesunde Beziehung f\\u00fchrt.Doch als er eines Tages in seiner Lieblingsbar auf die verf\\u00fchrerische Catherine trifft, ger\\u00e4t sein moralischer Kompass stark ins Wanken und schnell findet sich Vincent in einemwieder. Nachts holt ihn dann sein Gewissen ein, wenn der Casanova in schaurigen Albtr\\u00e4umen kilometerlange W\\u00fcrfelt\\u00fcrme erklimmt und dabei neben ein paar sprechenden Schafen auch auf echte Schreckgestalten trifft, denen ihr durch geschicktes Steine-Verschieben entkommen m\\u00fcsst.Auch wennbereits in jeder Liste zu japanischen Spielen (zurecht) seinen Platz findet, wollen wir an dieser Stelle nochmal f\\u00fcr den 2021 aufpolierten Vorg\\u00e4nger eine Lanze brechen., wie der bizarre Titel des Spiels lautet, ist n\\u00e4mlich mindestenswie sein viel gefeierter Nachfolger, bekommt aber trotz der verdienten Neuver\\u00f6ffentlichung deutlich weniger Beachtung. Als Bruder der an Runenpest erkrankten Yonah sucht ihr in NieR Replicant f\\u00fcr eure Schwester nach einem Heilmittel und bekommt dabei Hilfe vom sarkastischen Schm\\u00f6ker Grimoire Weiss, w\\u00e4hrend ihr die r\\u00e4tselhafte Spielwelt erkundet und fiese Schattenwesen unter die Erde schickt.Klar, spielerisch ist Replicant nicht ganz so ausgereift wie Automata und ein bisschen Spielzeitstreckung durch laufintensive Landschaftsbeschauung war beim urspr\\u00fcnglichen Release 2010 eben noch etwas \\u00fcblicher als heute. Doch wer \\u00fcber die kleinen Makel von Yoko Taros Werk hinwegschauen kann, bekommt mit NieR Replicant ein, das euch mit seinen facettenreichen Figuren, der ber\\u00fchrenden Geschichte und dem einzigartigen Soundtrack noch ganz lange im Ged\\u00e4chtnis bleiben wird.Wer an der japanischen Popkultur vor allem liebt, dass sie mitunter ziemlich laut, bunt und hektisch sein kann, dem sei das Rhyhmus-Spielempfohlen.

Games dio acceso a algunos jugadores a su prueba de estr\\u00e9s en l\\u00ednea. Tuve la oportunidad de probarlo y pude darme una idea de c\\u00f3mo funcionan sus servidores pero tambi\\u00e9n aprovech\\u00e9 para darle un vistazo previo a su lanzamiento. Aunque la prueba fue breve, note grandes cambios en Mortal Kombat 1 que compartir\\u00e9 contigo en este art\\u00edculo. Toma en cuenta que el juego ser\\u00e1 lanzado el 19 de septiembre, as\\u00ed que es probable que esta versi\\u00f3n de prueba y la versi\\u00f3n final tengan algunas diferencias.\\n\\nVideo: Mortal Kombat 1: lista de CAMBIOS que lo llevan a un nivel COMPLETAMENTE NUEVO\\n\\nMedidores y recursos\\n\\nEn Mortal Kombat 1 hay una barra con 3 segmentos que se ir\\u00e1n llenando con nuestras acciones en la batalla. Su funcionamiento es sencillo: los segmentos se gastan para amplificar el efecto de un ataque especial o frenar un combo con un Breaker. Este \\u00faltimo es un movimiento de emergencia bien conocido por los fans que vuelve para salvarnos de una paliza que parec\\u00eda inevitable. Para activar el Breaker tendremos que invertir la barra completa y el Kameo fighter debe estar disponible. El Breaker es muy \\u00fatil pero algo costoso, ya que tendr\\u00e1s que sacrificar todos tus recursos para reducir el castigo de tu oponente y salir del problema temporalmente.\\n\\nComo recordar\\u00e1s, Mortal Kombat 11 incluy\\u00f3 varios sistemas que trataban de balancear el juego y en el proceso afectaron la agresividad caracter\\u00edstica de Mortal Kombat X. La mayor parte de este sistema se elimin\\u00f3, comenzando por las barras que controlaban las mec\\u00e1nicas ofensivas y defensivas.\\n\\nEste nuevo sistema en Mortal Kombat 1 permite que te concentres en la batalla sin tantos distractores de medidores. Tambi\\u00e9n ayuda a que los combos sigan su curso sin tantas interrupciones y a que la ventaja sea m\\u00e1s clara cuando el rival quede tendido en el piso. Esto evita tener que adivinar el siguiente movimiento del oponente y que pierdas el turno en la ofensiva por un ataque inesperado.\\n\\nUsa el breaker bajo tu propio riesgo\\n\\nModificaciones y ausencias\\n\\nEl Breakaway que permit\\u00eda caer m\\u00e1s r\\u00e1pido para evitar recibir m\\u00e1s da\\u00f1o, las formas de levantarte girando o con un ataque invulnerable y el minibrinco para intentar abrir la guardia por arriba se eliminaron. Creo que el cambio m\\u00e1s dr\\u00e1stico es la falta de Krushing Blow, esos movimientos devastadores y caracter\\u00edsticas de cada personaje que se activaban cuando se cumpl\\u00edan ciertas condiciones y eran una herramienta \\u00fatil para extender combos. Estos movimientos se hicieron ic\\u00f3nicos en Mortal Kombat, como ocurri\\u00f3 con los movimientos X-ray. Sin embargo, aunque no est\\u00e1n, la magia de ver huesos crujir y \\u00f3rganos hacerse pedazos con un golpe se conserv\\u00f3.\\n\\nSi dedicaste muchas horas a jugar Mortal Kombat 11, notar\\u00e1s que el control se siente diferente con todas estas ausencias en Mortal Kombat 1. A primera vista, este reboot parece ser m\\u00e1s lento pero eso depende del estilo de ambos jugadores, hay muchas opciones que permiten jugar con cautela o ir directo a las agresiones.\\n\\nEl ritmo del juego m\\u00e1s pausado pero depende del estilo de cada jugador\\n\\nFatal Blow: todo en uno\\n\\nPara esta entrega se conservaron los Fatal Blow, que se pueden activar al tener 30% de vida o menos y son diferentes, seg\\u00fan el Kameo Fighter que utilices. Son un arma secreta con la que puedes dar la vuelta a la pelea porque generan un da\\u00f1o brutal en segundos. Puedes estar tranquilo: son ataques tan exagerados y violentos como siempre; de hecho, las fracturas y los acercamientos s\\u00fabitos a tejidos y chorros de sangre siguen presentes.\\n\\nEs interesante ver que los Kameo Fighters usan sus ataques insignia en sucesi\\u00f3n con el personaje que hayas elegido para pelear. Lo \\u00fanico que nos parece extra\\u00f1o es que, al momento de activarlos, su prioridad es irregular. Cuando jugamos, algunas veces el fatal blow absorbi\\u00f3 los ataques del oponente y pudo impactar sin problemas, y otras veces simplemente fue interrumpido por el rival con un golpe.\\n\\nLos Fatal Blow son retorcidos y presumen violencia extrema\\n\\nSistema defensivo reforzado\\n\\nMortal Kombat 1 trae de vuelta algunas mec\\u00e1nicas para reforzar la defensa. Comenzamos con el Flawless Block, que premia la precisi\\u00f3n en el momento de bloquear. Este sistema abr\\u00eda una ventana para contraatacar, y ahora simplemente evita el chip damage, es decir, que el da\\u00f1o al bloquear un ataque se reduzca a 0.\\n\\n\\n\\nTambi\\u00e9n existe un sistema para que te levantes m\\u00e1s despacio despu\\u00e9s de una ca\\u00edda; el tiempo es fijo y puede afectar la estrategia del oponente. Otra opci\\u00f3n es levantarse con un ataque reforzado con armadura, pero eso depende de cada personaje, y pueden ser muy diferentes en cada caso. La \\u00faltima opci\\u00f3n es llamar a tu Kameo Fighter para que ataque mientras te pones de pie, casi como si se tratara de un ataque sorpresa.\\n\\nAdem\\u00e1s, hay un a\\u00f1adido llamado upblock, un sistema m\\u00e1s t\\u00e9cnico que permite absorber un ataque a\\u00e9reo mientras presionas defensa y arriba; de esta forma, el efecto del golpe se desvanece y el oponente queda desprotegido. En caso de fallar, el oponente podr\\u00e1 castigarte por tu mala predicci\\u00f3n. Esto agrega un factor de riesgo que puede ser bien recompensado si bloqueas bien o hacerte perder hasta un round por tomar una mala decisi\\u00f3n.\\n\\nEl sistema defensivo es m\\u00e1s simple, pero funciona bien\\n\\nKameo Fighters: tus mejores aliados\\n\\nAhora vayamos a las estrellas de Mortal Kombat 1: los Kameo Fighters, que llegan con una carga de nostalgia para los fans m\\u00e1s veteranos. Son piezas clave en toda la pelea y su funci\\u00f3n es similar a la de otros juegos con asistencias, pero con detalles interesantes.\\n\\nLo primero es que tienen varias formas de ataque y puedes elegirlas dependiendo del bot\\u00f3n de direcci\\u00f3n que presiones. Por ejemplo, Sonya puede lanzarse por el aire con un pu\\u00f1etazo, cargar su anillo de energ\\u00eda y lanzarlo directamente o hacer su famoso agarre de tijera. Cada personaje es muy distinto y es clave para que los combos sean m\\u00e1s largos. Con el agarre de Jax puedes amplificar su da\\u00f1o si presionas un bot\\u00f3n en el momento correcto cuando azota al enemigo contra el piso.\\n\\nLa prueba inclu\\u00eda a Kano, Sonya y Jax, todos con ataques diferentes y divertidos que invitan a experimentarlos. Su apariencia, ataques y fatalities nos remontan al pasado con referencias de los primeros juegos de la saga.\\n\\nLos Kameo Fighters estar\\u00e1n presentes todo el tiempo, y cuando hagas un agarre hacia enfrente tu ayudante lo har\\u00e1 por ti. El Fatal Blow ser\\u00e1 diferente para cada uno y hasta tienen su propio Fatality. Sus usos ser\\u00e1n muy variados y nos emociona pensar en todo lo que podremos hacer con ellos en la versi\\u00f3n final del juego. Si algo nos queda claro es que Mortal Kombat 1 volar\\u00e1 tu imaginaci\\u00f3n.\\n\\nLos Kameo Fighter tienen cualidades \\u00fanicas\\n\\nJuego a\\u00e9reo y combos m\\u00e1s creativos\\n\\nEl sistema de combos cambi\\u00f3 mucho. Por ejemplo, aunque conserva el enfoque de mantener al oponente en una lluvia de golpes hasta que toque el piso, ahora hay m\\u00e1s opciones a\\u00e9reas. Cada personaje est\\u00e1 armado con combos preestablecidos para seguir tus cadenas una vez que el oponente est\\u00e9 en el aire. Esto permite rebotar al oponente una y otra vez o terminar con una r\\u00e1faga de bolas de fuego, en el caso de Liu Kang. Adem\\u00e1s, puedes llamar un Kameo Fighter para ampliar el n\\u00famero de golpes.\\n\\nEsta nueva estructura es buena, pero si no est\\u00e1s acostumbrado a los juegos tipo tag puedes tardar un poco en asimilarlo. El cambio viene bien a la franquicia despu\\u00e9s de intentar agregar opciones defensivas en Mortal Kombat 11 que afectaron el ritmo del juego. Los jugadores valoramos que un juego nos d\\u00e9 libertad para explorar y usar la imaginaci\\u00f3n para crear combos o rutas de ataque.\\n\\nLa mejor parte es que parece que algunos personajes tambi\\u00e9n tendr\\u00e1n propiedades especiales. Por ejemplo, Kenshi, el espadach\\u00edn con habilidades m\\u00edsticas, podr\\u00e1 invocar a un ancestro con su espada Sento y usarlo como una extensi\\u00f3n de \\u00e9l mismo. Algo as\\u00ed como Zato-1 en Guilty Gear -Strive- que pelea al lado de Eddie de forma separada. Espero que haya m\\u00e1s personajes que ofrezcan algo diferente a lo que estamos acostumbrados.\\n\\nTendr\\u00e1s libertad de experimentar y encontrar nuevas rutas de combos\\n\\nFatalities a domicilio\\n\\nEsta versi\\u00f3n de prueba incluy\\u00f3 un modo para un jugador con las cl\\u00e1sicas torres que me dej\\u00f3 conocer un poco de los personajes, sin embargo, la intenci\\u00f3n original era poner a prueba el juego en l\\u00ednea. Despu\\u00e9s de un rato de pr\\u00e1ctica, decid\\u00ed enfrentar a otros jugadores en l\\u00ednea y el primer d\\u00eda tuve una experiencia irregular; en la mayor\\u00eda de los casos, pude pelear sin problemas pero en otros, las batallas se detuvieron de tajo. En una ocasi\\u00f3n pude jugar contra SonicFox, el mejor jugador de Mortal Kombat y muchos otros juegos de pelea. Lamentablemente, el sistema nos desconect\\u00f3 despu\\u00e9s del primer round.\\n\\nLos siguientes d\\u00edas la experiencia mejor\\u00f3 y, aunque not\\u00e9 problemas sutiles como elementos fantasma en el fondo, las desconexiones no volvieron a ocurrir. Esto me hace tener fe en que NetherRealm Studios y su equipo dar\\u00e1n soporte constante a sus servidores. Fue una buena decisi\\u00f3n incluir rollback netcode para asegurar la mejor experiencia de juego. Por cierto, si eres un jugador competitivo y te preocupa jugar en las condiciones adecuadas, el sistema te mostrar\\u00e1 si los jugadores est\\u00e1n conectados por Wi-Fi o Ethernet, as\\u00ed que puedes decidir si tomar la pelea o no.\\n\\nTambi\\u00e9n regresaron los Quitality, una forma de humillar al oponente al dejar la partida. Adem\\u00e1s, si terminas con el golpe adecuado podr\\u00e1s acabar con el oponente de un Brutality; estos finishers son parte de la magia de Mortal Kombat y esperamos ver muchas formas extremas de acabar con el enemigo.\\n\\nHabr\\u00e1 finishers de todo tipo para humillar a tu oponente m\\u00e1s all\\u00e1 de la derrota\\n\\nBorr\\u00f3n y cuenta nueva\\n\\nEn conclusi\\u00f3n, Mortal Kombat 1 es una fiesta de hemoglobina que ha puesto mucha atenci\\u00f3n en los detalles para complacer a sus fans y, de paso, implementar un sistema m\\u00e1s limpio y vers\\u00e1til. Su apariencia realista muestra situaciones que van de lo grotesco al humor negro, siempre teniendo en mente que se trata de pura ficci\\u00f3n. Nos gusta que, a pesar de que la violencia y el universo creado por Ed Boon son la carta de presentaci\\u00f3n, Mortal Kombat 1 se esfuerza por experimentar con nuevos elementos como los Kameo Fighters.

Capcom 3's 1,346 registered players among them. Every other game featured at Evo saw an increase in attendance from last year's event, including Tekken 7 with 1,580 entrants--an increase of 382 from last year--and Dragon Ball FighterZ's 838 players, up from 2022's 635.\\n\\nThe official Evo website gave extra analysis on just how massive the Street Fighter 6 tournament will be this year, which includes a staggering fact: At least 50% of the field in every other game featured at the event also registered for SF6. If the field only included those who only registered for SF6, it would still be the largest tournament at the event with 3,121 players.\\n\\nAccording to the Evo organizer's data, crossover rates between Street Fighter 6 and the rest of the Evo field were as follows:\\n\\nKing Of Fighters XV - 82.4%\\n\\nGuilty Gear Strive - 74.7%\\n\\nUltimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 - 73.2%\\n\\nDragon Ball FighterZ - 66.8%\\n\\nMelty Blood: Type Lumina - 64.3%\\n\\nMortal Kombat 11 - 60.1%\\n\\nTekken 7 - 54.3%\\n\\nEvo 2023 takes place August 4-6 at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada.

According to the official Evo Twitter account--and Dragon Ball Z's Vegeta--over 9,000 people are participating in this year's event, a huge increase from last year's 7,000 participants.\\n\\nThanks to some napkin math by FireSquid Games' Ben Barrett, we've got a rough idea of just how busy the Evo tournament is going to be. If the overall number of players is around the 10,000 entrant mark, then that means that the weekend will see hundreds of 16-person pools and only a precious number of hours in which to organize all the matches as the competition is whittled down for the prestigious grand finals.\\n\\nNapkin math:\\n\\n10k entrants = 625 16-person pools.\\n\\n18 hours to get pools done (8am -> 2am), 35 pools an hour.\\n\\n10 minute matches, 28 matches per pool.\\n\\n5 setups per pool, 175 PS5s.\\n\\ngood luck https://t.co/sLsZQOd0CI \\u2014 Ben Barrett (@ChaosSmurf) June 30, 2023\\n\\nAs for the actual event, this Evo is shaping up to be an exciting one as Street Fighter 6 makes its debut on the grand stage. Capcom's new fighting game will be just two months old when Evo takes place from August 4-6, so there'll be some high-level competition here in what is expected to be the biggest draw of the tournament. The rest of the event lineup includes tournaments for The King of Fighters XV, Melty Blood: Type Lumina, Mortal Kombat 11, Guilty Gear Strive, Dragon Ball FighterZ, Ultimate Marvel Vs. Capcom 3, and Tekken 7.\\n\\nThis year's prize pool has a guaranteed $25,000 per tournament, with the prize money split between the top six finalists in each tournament.\"}, {\"source_name\":

She joked as she struggled with the wristband for Anderson Lee Aldrich before all 280 pounds of the 22-year-old disappeared into the crowd, where families, friends and lovers gathered happily to celebrate birthdays and enjoy a drag performance.\\n\\nAldrich walked among them, watching as they socialised, Club Q\\u2019s beloved bartenders serving up drinks and banter amidst the merriment and music. Ashtin had become close with her coworkers, particularly bar staff Daniel Aston, 28, and Derrick Rump, 38, who were working that night alongside Michael Anderson. The next time Ashtin would see Aldrich\\u2019s lumbering figure, bullets would be tearing through her body, despite Daniel\\u2019s valiant efforts to save her by standing between Ashtin and the shooter. As Aldrich continued the relentless attack, Ashtin covered herself in her friend\\u2019s blood and buried her head into his body, playing dead. She thought about the school massacre in Uvalde.\\n\\nAshtin recounted all of this exactly seven months and seven days after Aldrich opened fire at Club Q, killing Daniel and Derrick along with Kelly Loving, 40; Ashley Paugh, 35; and Raymond Green Vance, 22. Aldrich pleaded guilty this week to charges including five counts of murder and 46 counts of attempted murder, and many of the same Club Q patrons from that tragic night of 19 November 2022 found themselves again breathing the same air as the person whose hate-filled actions forever changed their lives and community.\\n\\nWhile the hulking, handcuffed Aldrich declined to speak on Monday \\u2014 a lawyer instead offering a weak, impersonal and somewhat sheepish apology in his client\\u2019s stead \\u2014 survivors and their relatives stood resolutely before the same judge who handed down a sentence of more than 2,000 years for Aldrich. Their testimony not only belied a fierce strength and defiance; it also formed a detailed and forensic account of the terror and heroism inside Club Q on that horrifying, now-infamous night \\u2014 in the words of the people who witnessed it firsthand.\\n\\nAnderson Lee Aldrich pleads guilty to 53 charges for killing five in Club Q shooting\\n\\nMichael, behind the bar, had been most concerned on 19 November about whether to take an Uber after shift or drive himself home as he worked alongside Daniel and Derrick. Both, like so many in Colorado, were transplants from other states; Daniel, 28, hailed from Oklahoma, while Derrick, 38, had come all the way from Pennsylvania. They\\u2019d often promise to keep Ashtin safe as they shouted to her mother over the phone when Cheryl Norton called to chat with her daughter. The Illinois mother felt like she knew the pair, whose loyalty, generosity and compassion were famous among their friends and family.\\n\\n\\u201cDerrick was a light to so many people ... whether they needed a shoulder to cry on, a listening ear or just someone to be there, Derrick would take on so much weight for others just to see them shine again,\\u201d his cousin said Monday in an audio message played in court. \\u201cDerrick was so unbelievably selfless; he would give you the shirt off his back, his last dollar, his last bit of food, and he would expect nothing in return, even if that meant he would be without.\\u201d\\n\\nAs Derrick, Daniel and Michael slung drinks, among the customers was regular Edward Sanders, who\\u2019d been coming to Club Q for decades. Wyatt Kent, a patron and performer, was there celebrating his birthday. His friend from second grade, Kassandra Fierro, was also in the club with her parents and long-term boyfriend, Raymond Green Vance, whom Wyatt had also become friendly with in the six years the couple had been dating.\\n\\nDaniel Aston, a 28-year-old beloved bartender at Club Q in Colorado Springs, died while trying to protect his friend and coworker when a shooter attacked the LGBTQ hotspot in November 2022 (Courtesy of Jeff Aston)\\n\\nDelusional, the night\\u2019s drag show producer and host, came on stage, called out birthday wishes and proclaimed happiness at having the opportunity to perform for such a crowd at such a venue. Then the performer walked backstage \\u2014 and caught the sound of gunfire.\\n\\n\\u201cAll I could hear were the gunshots and the music that continued to play,\\u201d Delusional said in a statement. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t see anything; I only heard. Though I didn\\u2019t see anything, these rounds haunt me in every moment of my life. I didn\\u2019t know it then, but I was listening to my friends die.\\u201d\\n\\nAldrich had temporarily left the club but returned in protective gear with guns and ammunition and opened fire. Customer Kelly Loving \\u2014 described by her sibling, Tiffany, as \\u201cmy compass, my best friend, my sister\\u201d in a statement read by her lawyer on Monday \\u2014 was cut down at just age 40. She fell to the ground right by Edward, who was also shot repeatedly and drifting in and out of consciousness.\\n\\nKelly, he said Monday, \\u201cfell right by my side ... she was not breathing. I watched her die right in front of me.\\u201d\\n\\nThe bullets continued to rain down.\\n\\nRaymond Green Vance, just 22, was fatally hit as his girlfriend and her family, along with the rest of Club Q, struggled to escape and comprehend what was happening. Derrick, described by his family as \\u201csomeone who would give you the shirt off his back,\\u201d was also killed by Aldrich\\u2019s bullets.\\n\\nDerrick Rump, another popular Club Q worker, was only 38 years old when he lost his life in the mass shooting (Derrick Rump via Facebook)\\n\\nAshtin and her family fought hard to get the words out on Monday as they detailed how Daniel tried to save her life.\\n\\n\\u201cDaniel stood in front of my wife when the killer ... shot my wife nine times \\u2013 but he took the brunt of it,\\u201d Ashtin\\u2019s husband, Ryan, said of the murdered 28-year-old. \\u201cHe is a hero. He is the definition of a hero.\\u201d\\n\\nRyan had been at the end of a nine-month deployment overseas, one week away from coming home, when he received the shocking phone call that his wife had been shot. Ashtin had also left him a plaintive, cryptic voicemail on the night, screaming his name \\u2014 a haunting voicemail she played in court on Monday.\\n\\nAs she lay covered in Daniel\\u2019s blood in November, however \\u2014 desperately hoping for a better police response than the one she\\u2019d heard about in Uvalde, where a school shooter killed 21 almost exactly six months earlier \\u2014 Club Q patrons were mounting a counter-assault on the shooter.\\n\\nThomas James, a serving member of the Navy, was on the patio outside Club Q when the shooting began, authorities said Monday at a conference after the hearing.\\n\\n\\u201cAs the defendant approached that area of the club, he moved himself towards the doors that the shooter would come through,\\u201d 4th Judicial District Attorney Michael Allen said. \\u201cIn the process, he was struck in the abdomen. Despite being wounded by a gunshot, he engaged with the shooter and undoubtedly saved countless lives.\\n\\n\\u201cHis actions were quite simply heroic, selfless and an example of humanity that we should all strive to achieve. Because he was wounded, his strength was quickly draining from him, and he was joined by Richard Fierro carrying on the attack on the defendant.\\u201d\\n\\nKassandra\\u2019s father and an Army veteran with overseas combat experience, Rich Fierro felt his instinct and military training kick in as he shouted at and beat the shooter. Ashtin could hear through the shock and confusion.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen the music stopped, I could hear screams ... one of which was screaming about killing the responsible party,\\u201d she said on Monday. \\u201cI wish they had.\\u201d\\n\\nAldrich, however, had attempted to wrestle out from the Army veteran\\u2019s grasp \\u2014 only to be thwarted by the final witness who gave dramatic testimony on Monday.\\n\\nClub Q victim Kelly Loving, 40, \\u2018spent her time eliminating stigma and bias,\\u2019 her sister said Monday in a statement, asking \\u2018everyone to embrace our differences and denounce hate and violence. I refuse to let my sister be erased by ongoing violence against the LGBTQ community\\u2019 (Twitter)\\n\\nDrea Norman had been only eight or nine meters from Club Q\\u2019s entrance when Aldrich \\u201calmost enthusasticaly pulled up to the front door of the club, raised his rifle and stormed the building,\\u201d Drea said this week, arriving near the end of court proceedings and prompting a temporary pause in the prosecution\\u2019s address to the judge.\\n\\n\\u201cI saw muzzle flashes and barely noticed a window to my right exploded before I dropped to the floor as fast as I could, thinking, \\u2018Holy f***, this is actually happening,\\u2019\\u201d Drea said Monday in an emotional firsthand account. \\u201cMy daze was quickly broken by an instinctual urge to survive and the possibility that the shooter would come back to finish people off \\u2013 so I crawled on my hands and knees to make it to the kitchen, where I thought it\\u2019d be the safest place to escape.\\u201d\\n\\nOn the way, Drea passed Raymond Green Vance, calling out and checking for vitals with no success, before sheltering in the freezer until there was a pause in shooting \\u2013 when Drea made the brave but terrifying decision to venture back out to check on loved ones.\\n\\n\\u201cI then found Mr Aldrich held down with Tom and Richard Fierro and found my partner shaken, bloodied and in tears; she sat next to Mr Aldrich\\u2019s third victim, Derrick,\\u201d Drea said Monday. \\u201cI could only tell that he was hit in the neck, but the look on his face told me everything.\\n\\n\\u201cI heard Richard shouting that he needed help; the shooter was crawling away from the grasp that he had him in ... I stood above him; my only thought was, thrown my foot down, stop him \\u2014 and after I would imagine what was 10 strikes I stopped, feeling like that was more than enough. And I walked away at the same time; that was when the police came in and they were looking for Mr Aldrich and I pointed, gesturing at him ... and they proceeded to detain and arrest him.\\u201d\\n\\nDrea continued \\u2014 poised, tall and standing straight: \\u201cI want everyone here today to understand that this was deliberate. It almost looked excitable to the shooter. And as I left to go home and clean up all the blood on me, I knew that I would probably never go out again.\\u201d\\n\\nThat residual trauma was repeated over and over on Monday by survivors, their relatives and the loved ones of the dead. Ashtin \\u2014 deliberately wearing a replica of the same hoodie she\\u2019d worn as she handed Aldrich a Club Q wristband before the shooting spree \\u2014 lowered it to show her physical scars. She\\u2019s reconsidering her plans to have children, and her intended career in forensics no longer holds the same appeal after such a vicious crime upended her own life. Her mother sleeps with guard dogs; Daniel\\u2019s parents can\\u2019t fill the hole in their hearts and lives.\\n\\nAshley Paugh\\u2019s adolescent daughter is now motherless but continuing her parent\\u2019s legacy by choosing to forgive the shooter \\u2014 unlike many others in the family.\\n\\nStephanie Clark, left, lost her sister Ashley Paugh in the Colorado Springs nightclub massacre; she said on Monday that Ashley\\u2019s daughter, 11, wanted to follow in her mother\\u2019s footsteps and forgive the shooter (Facebook / Stephanie Clark)\\n\\n\\u201cMy 11-year-old niece wants to forgive you, because she says that\\u2019s what she feels her mom would want her to do,\\u201d Ashley\\u2019s sister said in a statement to Aldrich on Monday. \\u201cMy sister taught her to be a caring and forgiving person, and I\\u2019m glad she still has that innocent mind and hasn\\u2019t realised what an evil world we really live in.\\u201d\\n\\nAshley\\u2019s husband, Kurt, steeled himself while describing his high school sweetheart, who devoted her life to working with foster families and \\u201cwould have had a conversation with this low-life with no judgment whatsoever.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cHer love and joy for these children and these families was so special and person to her,\\u201d he said of his wife\\u2019s work. \\u201cThose families and these children are also feeling the loss of Ashley, who was taken by one senseless act of hate. It hurts that this monster gets to spend the rest of his life in prison living off our tax dollars ... [and] rot in loneliness and hate.\\n\\n\\u201cMy wife\\u2019s name \\u2014 Ashley Marie Paugh \\u2014 will live on through memories, through her loved ones and especially her daughter.\\u201d\\n\\nKelly Loving\\u2019s relatives, too, hoped that her life and legacy would continue to inspire others to love, despite the fact that hatred caused her death.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to let my sadness turn to anger, because I know Kelly spent her time eliminating stigma and bias,\\u201d Tiffany Loving\\u2019s statement continued, adding: \\u201cToday, I ask everyone to embrace our differences and denounce hate and violence. I refuse to let my sister be erased by ongoing violence against the LGBTQ community.\\u201d\\n\\nThe family of Derrick Rump, still in disbelief, reiterated that he \\u201cdid not deserve this; he deserved to live a full and loving life with his family and friends,\\u201d his cousin said in an audio message played in court.\\n\\n\\u201cDerrick\\u2019s inner strength and wisdom will forever be missed but never forgotten,\\u201d she continued. \\u201cHis laughter and smile will continue to live on through stories.\\u201d\\n\\nDespite that, however his family has \\u201cno forgiveness in our hearts for\\u201d Aldrich, she said.\\n\\n\\u201cWe hope he never has a good night\\u2019s sleep,\\u201d Derrick\\u2019s cousin said, adding: \\u201cWe hope he never has a reason to smile ... we hope he is greeted with the same hatred every day that he has shown. We hope he never has another day\\u2019s peace, because the only peace our family will know is that one day this awful being will die \\u2014 and we know that, when it comes time for his [final] judgement, he will be going straight to hell to rot.\\u201d\\n\\nRaymond Green Vance, 22, was socializing with his long-term girlfriend, Kassandra Fierro, and her parents at Club Q when he was gunned down in November; Army veteran Richard Fierro helped subdue the shooter (Colorado Springs Police Department)\\n\\nJessica Fierro, after watching her daughter\\u2019s boyfriend shot dead, her husband subdue a gunman in their hometown and sustaining injury herself, angrily called Aldrich on Monday \\u201cnot a human\\u201d and \\u201ca monster, a killer, a murderer, a failure, a coward, a racist, a bigot, an embarrassment to society who has earned a one-way ticket to eternity in prison five times over and then some.\\u201d\\n\\nKassandra, speaking after her, lamented how the family had embarked upon an unassuming, fun night \\u2014 only to have \\u201cour entire futures ripped from us because of that evil man\\u201d.\\n\\n\\u201cI will never get to grow old with my person,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI will never get the chance to marry the love of my life. I will never get to start a family with Raymond. I will never get to see or hear or feel Raymond ever again. I will never, ever be able to unsee my future laying in a casket before me. All of this for no reason.\\u201d\\n\\nAshtin, her voice still steely and resolute after fighting for her life while watching her friends die less than a year ago, minced no words when it came to her thoughts about Aldrich\\u2019s punishment.\\n\\n\\u201cI wish this was a death penalty state,\\u201d she said. \\u201cNot because I want him to die; that would be too easy. I want him to sit in a jail cell not knowing when he\\u2019s going to die and what could be his last breath ... like he did to us.\\u201d\\n\\nBut she and everyone else emphasised the need for strength and unity going forward \\u2013 but especially remembrance of the Club Q family members who could no longer speak for themselves.\\n\\n\\u201cThe number \\u2018five\\u2019 is cold,\\u201d Ashtin\\u2019s father, Bill Norton, said in a statement she read in court. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a statistic. It doesn\\u2019t convey what truly happened ... how much we truly lost. We should always remember that the number represents Daniel. We should also remember the number five represents Derrick.\\u201d\\n\\nIt represents Kelly Loving. It represents Ashley Paugh. It represents Raymond Green Vance.\\n\\n\\u201cAll of them had their own unique place in this world,\\u201d Mr Norton said. \\u201cAll of whom are now gone and will never been seen again.\\u201d\\n\\nEvery speaker on Monday urged remembrance of those names \\u2013 along with the names of the heroes who saved more lives: Thomas James.

together a custom leverless fighting game pad that's adorably shaped like two Ditto fusing together, much to the delight of this Gen 1 Pok\\u00e9mon fan.\\n\\nWhile it's not a controller you can freely buy, it looks well-suited to the best fighting games like Street Fighter 6 and Guilty Gear Strive, due to its comfy-looking wrist rest and simple stickless layout.\\n\\nSpeaking to PC Gamer, Rudeism explained that \\\"from concept to completion,\\\" the build took roughly a month to complete. Though Rudeism admits much of that was waiting for parts to arrive in the mail. They explain that the they only needed \\\"around 2\\u20133 days for design and construction.\\\"\\n\\nWant to get a vicarious feel for the pad itself? Rudeism posted a clip of themselves over on Twitter, showcasing the satisfying clacking of the controller's mechanical switches.\\n\\nclackies pic.twitter.com/sgHeINMmutJune 29, 2023 See more\\n\\nWhile we're unfortunately unable to buy Rudeism's Ditto-themed fight pad, there are many official products like it. Leverless controllers like the Hit Box and Snack Box Micro are often considered some of the best fight sticks you can buy. They can afford players an advantage in matches thanks to faster inputs compared to a traditional stick. However, they're more often than not vastly more expensive. That said, many players find it hard to go back once they've made the switch to a leverless gamepad.\\n\\nDon't feel like you need to own a Hit Box-style controller, though. During my visit to South Africa's Red Bull Kumite tournament last weekend, I spoke to several competing pros who unanimously recommended new players to play Street Fighter 6 with whatever controller they were comfortable with.\\n\\nJabhi 'JabhiM' Mabuza, the South African representative, even managed to beat Hajime 'Tokido' Taniguchi with a DualSense wireless controller; a monumentally impressive feat considering Tokido's reputation as one of the absolute greatest.\\n\\nIf you are planning on shopping for controllers soon, you may want to do so as part of the Prime Day gaming deals happening between July 11 - 12. There'll be plenty of Prime Day Xbox controller deals in particular if you want to snag a pad or two at a serious price drop.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Anime News Network\", \"author\": null, \"title\": \"Crunchyroll Unveils Plans for EVO in Las Vegas\", \"description\": \"CRUNCHYROLL PLANS ELECTRIFYING EXPERIENCE AT RECORD-BREAKING EVOLUTION CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES (EVO) 2023 Crunchyroll Delivers Anime Experience Showcasing...\", \"url\": \"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2023-07-12/crunchyroll-unveils-plans-for-evo-in-las-vegas/.200198\", \"text\": \"CRUNCHYROLL PLANS ELECTRIFYING EXPERIENCE AT RECORD-BREAKING EVOLUTION CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES (EVO) 2023\\n\\n\\n\\nCrunchyroll Delivers Anime Experience Showcasing Street Fighter: Duel, Live Performances, Anime Trailers, Merchandise, And Much More\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nCrunchyroll\\n\\nSony\\n\\nCulver City, California (July 12, 2023) \\u2013, the global leader in bringing the ultimate anime experience to fans in over 200 countries and territories, is excited to announce plans for the upcoming record-breaking Evolution Championship Series ( Evo ) in Las Vegas from August 4-6.

avr\\u00e0 un'esperienza online migliore, al netto di qualche taglio di animazione tipico dei netcode rollback di mediocre fattura.\\\"\\n\\nCome sottolineato da SchiacciSempre, al momento Tekken 8 non implementa un rollback netcode allo stesso livello di Street Fighter 6 o di giochi pi\\u00f9 datati Mortal Kombat 11 e Guilty Gear Strive: \\\"\\u00e8 praticamente impossibile giocare contro connessioni in Wi-Fi ma anche match disputati con un ping superiore agli 80 ci sono sembrati davvero poco piacevoli, con ritardi e tagli di animazioni eccessive.\\\"\\n\\nAd oggi dunque \\\"l'esperienza online di Tekken 8 risulta insoddisfacente, ed \\u00e8 un vero peccato\\\" tuttavia c'\\u00e8 ancora tempo per apportare migliorie in tal senso, dal momento che il gioco non ha ancora una finestra di lancio ben definita.\\n\\nLa seconda fase del Closed Network Test di Tekken 8 si terr\\u00e0 dal 28 al 31 luglio su PC, PS5 e Xbox Series X/S, accessibile da coloro che hanno gi\\u00e0

closed network test di Tekken 8, notando dei grossi passi in avanti sul piano del gameplay, ma anche una componente online arretrata.\", \"url\":

Harada si \\u00e8 mostrata a un pubblico pi\\u00f9 ampio, attraverso un esteso closed network test che si \\u00e8 tenuto lo scorso weekend. Vi abbiamo gi\\u00e0 parlato di Tekken 8 nel contesto del playtest effettuato a Lione qualche mese fa. Il titolo che ci siamo trovati davanti era ruvido, inevitabilmente sbilanciato e con alcuni difetti di giovent\\u00f9. Gi\\u00e0 dal primo impatto con questa nuova versione abbiamo percepito qualcosa di radicalmente diverso.\\n\\n\\n\\nPotremmo quasi affermare di trovarci di fronte a un gioco differente, pi\\u00f9 in linea con gli standard della serie Tekken, meno pirotecnico a pi\\u00f9 sobrio, al netto di qualche problema di bilanciamento che verr\\u00e0 sicuramente risolto nel processo di sviluppo. Il team di Harada ha accolto gran parte del feedback pervenutogli durante i primi test offline e ha presentato al pubblico una build estremamente solida, anche se non priva di difetti.\\n\\nAl servizio del neofita\\n\\nIl network test che abbiamo avuto modo di analizzare disponeva fortunatamente di un training mode, il che ci ha permesso di entrare in contatto con alcune nuove funzioni, create appositamente per rendere il titolo pi\\u00f9 fruibile e comprensibile a qualsiasi tipologia di giocatore. Street Fighter 6 ha fatto scuola in questo senso (ecco la nostra recensione di Street Fighter 6), ma non possiamo fare a meno di apprezzare gli sforzi profusi da Bandai Namco, nonostante prendano una direzione completamente differente dal concorrente Capcom, con tutorial e spiegazioni pi\\u00f9 in linea con le diverse esigenze del picchiaduro a tre dimensioni.\\n\\nPer comprendere la \\\"ratio\\\" di certe scelte di design, bisogna interrogarsi su quali siano le principali difficolt\\u00e0 della serie Tekken per un neofita. L'opera con Jin e Kazuya non presenta particolari problematiche di esecuzione, a differenza di Street Fighter che prevede l'utilizzo di motion complesse e combo fulminee. Il principale scoglio della creatura di Harada, per un novizio dei picchiaduro, risiede nelle gargantuesche movelist fatte di simboli, terminologie e legende difficili da comprendere. Per un nuovo giocatore, ma anche per un esperto che volesse imparare un personaggio da zero, risultava estremamente ostico destreggiarsi all'interno di queste liste mosse ed estrapolare le tecniche pi\\u00f9 efficaci per il proprio lottatore, in modo da formulare una strategia e iniziare a costruire le prime combo. Tekken 8 risolve questo problema con classe, introducendo una movelist semplificata con le tecniche principali di ogni guerriero e con brevi spiegazioni testuali che esplicitano in che modo impiegarle. Nonostante le traduzioni italiane non siano sempre impeccabili, riusciremo a individuare subito i colpi veloci a breve distanza, gli assalti a lungo raggio, le tecniche che ci daranno modo di attivare lo stato Heat e quelle che ci concederanno di estendere le combo.\\n\\n\\n\\nUtilizzando questo ristretto numero di tecniche, che si aggirano tra le 17 e le 20 contro le 80 circa della movelist \\\"estesa\\\", il giocatore avr\\u00e0 la possibilit\\u00e0 di costruire una solida base su cui inserire lentamente altre azioni, e migliorare progressivamente la variet\\u00e0 del proprio arsenale offensivo. Eviter\\u00e0 quindi di sentirsi schiacciato dal peso di una movelist titanica e potr\\u00e0, dopo pochi minuti passati in allenamento, disputare le prime partite online o con amici.\\n\\nLa vera novit\\u00e0 di questa build risiede nella modalit\\u00e0 \\\"sfide combo\\\".\\n\\nSi tratta di una funzione gi\\u00e0 presente da anni in altre serie, ma mai comparsa nella saga del Pugno di Ferro. Attraverso circa 12 sfide di difficolt\\u00e0 crescente, il giocatore potr\\u00e0 apprendere le principali combo del proprio personaggio senza ricorrere a risorse esterne, come YouTube, siti internet o guide online. Le combo proposte non sono sicuramente ottimali, ma sono sufficienti a dare un'infarinatura generale a chi vuole cominciare a cimentarsi con uno specifico combattente del roster. Il nostro augurio \\u00e8 che tale modalit\\u00e0 venga ampliata e possa includere anche combo di difficolt\\u00e0 pi\\u00f9 alta.\\n\\n\\n\\nPassiamo quindi ai controlli semplificati, che presentano delle sostanziali differenze con i \\\"controlli Moderni\\\" di Street Fighter.\\n\\nSe nel titolo Capcom lo schema Moderno \\u00e8 una alternativa allo stile Classico, valida ed utilizzabile in torneo, la modalit\\u00e0 Assistita di Tekken va vista come un ausilio utile solo nelle prime ore di gioco. Per utilizzare una metafora comprensibile ai pi\\u00f9, i controlli semplificati del titolo Bandai Namco sono pi\\u00f9 simili a delle rotelle supplementari per una bicicletta: servono a non perdere l'equilibrio nei primi momenti, ma vanno scartati quanto prima poich\\u00e9 precludono la maggior parte delle manovre offensive. Apprezzabile \\u00e8 quindi la possibilit\\u00e0 di passare in tempo reale dai controlli semplificati a quelli classici, in modo che il giocatore novizio possa lentamente affrancarsi dai primi per sfruttare i secondi. Insomma, gradualit\\u00e0 e progressivit\\u00e0 sono le parole chiave alla base della filosofia di design di Tekken 8: un approccio didattico differente ma ugualmente valido rispetto al picchiaduro di Ryu e Ken.\\n\\nSostanziali cambiamenti al gameplay\\n\\nLa prima build del titolo Bandai Namco presentava uno stile estremamente aggressivo, danni elevatissimi e la possibilit\\u00e0 di concludere i round con poche scelte. Ci\\u00f2 aveva causato molteplici critiche da parte dei veterani della saga e degli addetti ai lavori, che consideravano la serie Tekken snaturata e impoverita in questo ottavo capitolo. Il tempo per le interazioni era poco, e i danni elevanti non permettevano al combat system di \\\"respirare\\\" e mostrare tutte le peculiarit\\u00e0 dei singoli personaggi.\\n\\nUn secondo elemento di forte criticit\\u00e0, che avevamo evidenziato anche noi nel corso della nostra prima prova, risiedeva nella presenza di innumerevoli effetti particellari che rendevano l'azione, in certi frangenti, difficilmente intellegibile.Il team di Harada ha lavorato sodo su tutto il feedback pervenutogli e ha cambiato in maniera sostanziale il titolo, che ad oggi sembra completamente rivoluzionato. Scompaiono innanzitutto i due indicatori a forma di catena presenti nella prima build, sostituiti da una pi\\u00f9 elegante barra secondaria, posizionata sotto l'indicatore vitale dei lottatori.\\n\\n\\n\\nSar\\u00e0 quindi possibile effettuare un solo Heat Dash, piuttosto che due, prima di consumarla completamente. Questo riduce nettamente l'aggressivit\\u00e0 del sistema Heat, ma cambia anche il suo utilizzo all'interno dei match.\\n\\nPiuttosto che forzare la propria offensiva usando due Heat Dash di fila, sar\\u00e0 pi\\u00f9 conveniente mantenere la modalit\\u00e0 potenziata quanto pi\\u00f9 a lungo possibile e sfruttare le tecniche pi\\u00f9 potenti, come Heat Dash o Heat Smash, solo quando questa sar\\u00e0 quasi esaurita. Il cambiamento \\u00e8 davvero importante, poich\\u00e9 permetter\\u00e0 di far brillare le capacit\\u00e0 specifiche di ogni personaggio nella modalit\\u00e0 Heat. Come avevamo gi\\u00e0 spiegato nelle nostre prove precedenti, ogni lottatore ricever\\u00e0 dei notevoli potenziamenti entrando in Heat Mode. Kazuya ad esempio disporr\\u00e0 di nuove stringhe che sfruttano la sua forma demoniaca, mentre King potr\\u00e0 beneficiare della versione potenziata del suo Jaguar Sprint, che gli permetter\\u00e0 di scattare in avanti assorbendo i colpi dell'avversario.\\n\\n\\n\\nTali peculiarit\\u00e0 erano presenti gi\\u00e0 nella build di Lione, ma i danni ed i ritmi di gioco erano talmente elevati da annullarne quasi totalmente la profondit\\u00e0 strategica. Un cambiamento senza ombra di dubbio ben accetto, che rende il nuovo titolo della saga dell'Iron Fist pi\\u00f9 strategico e ponderato, ma anche per certi versi pi\\u00f9 derivativo e meno rivoluzionario. Dopo queste modifiche il gioco risulta infatti molto pi\\u00f9 simile ai Tekken precedenti, il che pu\\u00f2 essere interpretato in senso positivo o negativo a seconda del tipo di aspettative dello specifico utente.\\n\\nPer quanto riguarda gli effetti particellari, il team di Harada ha introdotto uno slider allo scopo di ridurne l'impatto. I giocatori potranno selezionare un livello Alto, Medio o Basso. Al grado inferiore, il titolo appare estremamente pulito, leggibile e senza fronzoli, e supponiamo che questo settaggio sar\\u00e0 quello preferito dalla maggior parte dei giocatori competitivi. Riteniamo tuttavia che anche a livello Medio il gioco non risulti troppo caotico e mantenga una certa leggibilit\\u00e0 di fondo. Gli sviluppatori si sono mostrati quindi estremamente recettivi alle critiche, canalizzando in senso positivo tutti i feedback pervenutigli durante i playtest pubblici e migliorando gli aspetti pi\\u00f9 deboli della produzione.\\n\\nLe principali criticit\\u00e0\\n\\nArriviamo alle note dolenti, che riguardano purtroppo una componente ormai fondamentale dell'esperienza di gioco: il multiplayer. Il rollback netcode \\u00e8 considerato elemento imprescindibile di ogni picchiaduro, e purtroppo in questo Closed Network Test risulta davvero mal implementato.\\n\\nIl gioco permetter\\u00e0, attraverso uno specifico menu, di scegliere un netcode ibrido, in tutto e per tutto simile a quello del capitolo precedente, e un rollback di stampo moderno. Tale sistema funziona in maniera simile alla scelta tra modalit\\u00e0 grafica e modalit\\u00e0 performance dei titoli single player. Dando priorit\\u00e0 alla grafica, si verificheranno meno \\\"salti\\\" tra un'animazione e l'altra, ma la risposta ai comandi sar\\u00e0 notevolmente ritardata; mentre privilegiando la fluidit\\u00e0 si avr\\u00e0 un'esperienza online migliore, al netto di qualche taglio di animazione tipico dei netcode rollback di mediocre fattura.\\n\\nDiciamolo subito: siamo molto lontani dalla componente di rete di titoli come Street Fighter 6, Mortal Kombat 11 e Guilty Gear Strive. Risulta praticamente impossibile giocare contro connessioni in Wi-Fi, ma anche match disputati con un ping superiore agli 80 ci sono sembrati davvero poco piacevoli, con ritardi e tagli di animazioni eccessive. Considerata la natura current gen e le potenzialit\\u00e0 offerte dalle ultime console Sony e Microsoft, ci si aspettava decisamente di pi\\u00f9, nonostante le difficolt\\u00e0 insite nell'applicare il netcode rollback ad un picchiaduro 3D.\\n\\n\\n\\nTekken 8 \\u00e8 il principale esponente del filone tridimensionale dei fighting game, ed era lecito aspettarsi una notevole innovazione in questo senso. Il team ha ancora tempo per sistemare le cose, nonostante il grosso dell'infrastruttura online sia ormai stato creato, ma \\u00e8 nostro compito registrare la situazione attuale. Al momento, l'esperienza online di Tekken 8 risulta insoddisfacente, ed \\u00e8 un vero peccato.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Famitsu.com\", \"author\": null, \"title\":

Today , we are talking about the changing landscape of video gaming. I'm Jade Hindman. Here's to conversations that keep you informed and inspired and make you think. E-sports. It's a highly competitive billion dollar industry.\\n\\nS2: It's all about winning , right ? It's all about getting the W , it's all about Fortnite , get the chicken dinner. And so the real goal of any sport , any esport at that is to beat your opponent.\\n\\nS1: While winning is key , it's also a way for gamers to connect and find community. We'll talk about the gaming culture , the industry and what students from elementary to collegiate levels are learning from it. That's ahead on Midday Edition. First , the news. For many of us , video games are usually played for fun , right ? Think Super Mario Brothers or Minecraft , some of the best selling video games of all time. But there's a growing community of gamers with a different purpose for playing , and that is to win Competitive gaming or esports is huge. You can see it in gaming tournaments across the country , where professional players prove their prowess and compete for prize pools. Many colleges and universities have dedicated programs that offer scholarships , and it's even reached the Olympics , which recently concluded its inaugural esports week. E-sports are definitely an important part of the gaming scene , bringing in billions in revenue. But how big is it truly ? Will it ever evolve from a niche hobby to enter the mainstream media edition producer Andrew Bracken spoke with Levi Winslow , a staff writer at Kotaku , where they report on esports creator culture and Internet discourse. Here's that conversation.\\n\\nS3:\\n\\nS2: So if you think of basketball , if you think of football , these legitimate sports that have these massive organizations behind them , and then you just translate that to a digital setting , say Madden , NFL 23 or NBA two K 23 , you get the same result. So eSports is just a portmanteau of electronic sports , same concept.\\n\\nS3:\\n\\nS2: Of course you have other games like Fortnite has a major esports scene. Rocket League also has another one , and then you have the FGC or the fighting Game community. So you've got stuff like Smash Bros , Melee or Ultimate Guilty Gear , Strive , Tekken seven and upcoming Tekken eight and Capcom with Street Fighter five and now Street Fighter six. These would be some of the regular games you'd see in the esports circuit.\\n\\nS3:\\n\\nS2: You've definitely got Madden , you've got NBA. FIFA is there as well. You know , these more traditional sports games don't have as big of an esports audience as some of the more expected games like a Call of Duty or a Street fighter or even a Dragonball fighter Z by Arc system works would.\\n\\nS3:\\n\\nS2: As much as esports is very much like a sport is so very different because some games are team based. Then you also have one on one games as well. You know , Smash Bros , Tekken , Fortnite , these are sort of 1V1. So it really depends on the game itself. But at the end of the day , you know , it's all about winning , right ? It's all about getting the W , it's all about Fortnite , get the chicken dinner. And so the real goal of any sport , any esport at that is to beat your opponent. So whether you're playing in a team , say , rocket League and you're trying to beat another team , or if you're playing , say , Smash Bros Ultimate and you're fighting against another individual player , the goal is still the same.\\n\\nS3: And esports , at least locally , relies a lot on grassroots efforts. For example , a lot of local tournaments are organized through grassroots groups.\\n\\nS2: That whole tournament scene was started by grassroots organizations like GBK or Video Game Bootcamp , while Nintendo Now and Nintendo is the publisher of such games like Smash Bros sometimes is throwing its weight and money behind tournaments. It didn't previously , but players saw the potential , the deep mechanics in these smash games , the Smash Bros games to do something greater , do something bigger. They took it upon themselves. To create the scene and so they'll organize via Start. JG which is a website owned by Microsoft that tracks tournaments , tracks , players , tracks , who's winning in certain tournaments and has signups for tournaments and things of that nature. They'll organize their they'll organize , you know , on online spaces like Twitter and Discord , or if there's just a local scene and they do it out of the you know , I don't want to say like the goodness of their heart , because that sounds cliche , but I do believe that that is really it. They do it for the love of the game.\\n\\nS3: And , you know , we know it takes a lot of skill , a lot of training , dedication to be a professional athlete. And I'm sure the same applies to professional esports players.\\n\\nS2: That takes dexterity , but it's not like weight training or cardio or anything like that. But still , there's a mental game that goes into it , right ? There's an understanding of the matchup , which is a esports term that relates to how certain characters , certain guns stay , Call of Duty , certain cars say Rocket League , compare and compete with other characters , other guns , other cars within their respective games. And so for a player who is hoping to get into esports , they would need to , of course , understand the fundamental elements of the game itself , the mechanics , the weight of the characters or the cars or the guns , the minutia of the game itself.\\n\\nS3: I'm thinking of it more in terms of maybe like a professional chess player rather than , say , a professional soccer player. You mentioned sort of this kind of strategy and practicing these smaller things , maybe not so much , you know , weight training and things like that that you mentioned.\\n\\nS2: Yeah , I , I think that that's a good analogy because in chess , right , it's a lot about positioning your pieces to corner your opponent and ensure that they can't make moves or you take their pieces so that they have fewer pieces and then you can box them in and , you know , checkmate them. It's very much the same in esports. It's about understanding your opponent , being able to predict what it is that they're going to do or might do or could do. And that's what I mean by understanding the matchup in the same way that chess , having that familiarity with various moves , various strategies will give you the edge in performing better.\\n\\nS3: You're listening to Kpbs Midday Edition. I'm Andrew Bracken. I'm speaking with Levi Winslow , staff writer at Kotaku , about the world of sports. It seems like esports is breaking more and more into the mainstream , with the Olympics recently ending its first ever esports week. However , there was some controversy over its lineup of games and there seemed to be a disconnect between the organizers and the actual esports teams.\\n\\nS2: I don't know if it ever will. And the reason why I say that is because there's such a high barrier to entry to even understand esports. Not every game plays the same , and because not every game plays the same , not every game is going to have the same glossary of terms , the same jargon. And that is where it becomes difficult for , say , a more casual fan of video games to just jump into watching the Call of Duty League or a League of Legends tournament. Because just saying that in and of itself , I mean , those are two fundamentally different games that do have esports scenes. And because there isn't a shared glossary , there isn't a shared understanding of what makes an esport and e-sport that makes it difficult for it to break into the mainstream even further.\\n\\nS3: And you know , in this discussion about it becoming mainstream , you know , in 2022 , the esports industry was valued at $1.45 billion. It's projected to grow even more this year. But there has been some talk about how the industry is starting to teeter or that it's becoming unprofitable.\\n\\nS2: If you think about a traditional sports , if you go into a bar , you can watch games for free. But if you wanted to watch a game at home , you would either have to pay for like a streaming package , like , say , ESPN Plus on Hulu , right ? Or you'd have to buy a ticket to go see a game. So I believe that in most cases , traditional sports are gated behind some sort of paywall. There's a fee in order to watch a traditional sport and that then is funneled back into the National Basketball Association or , you know , the Football association , National Football League. eSports , on the other hand , is free to watch. You can hop on Twitch right now , subscribe to or follow Vbc Video Game Bootcamp and the moment that they're alive with a smash tournament or a guilty Gear Strive tournament , you could just click and immediately start watching. It's not gated. There's no paywall. And so I think that's part of the reason why it's so unprofitable. Yes , there are tickets that you can buy to go see these people in person , to go see these tournaments in person , to go really be part of the action. But it's not necessary. And I also think that there's an inflated conception of esports being bigger than it actually is , because I think that despite it breaking into the mainstream and so far as reaching the Olympics , it's still so niche. And publishers Activision Blizzard , for example , are expecting these huge , huge returns on what is really a niche hobby within the popularity of video games.\\n\\nS3:\\n\\nS2: I don't think so. I think that there is a knowledge gap. I think that's the real issue. You spoke about being in the games industry for several years. Obviously I'm a game journalist and a lot of people think that my job is just to sit down and play video games. Not totally true. I don't think I've actually had the opportunity to sit down and play a video game in since Diablo launched , and that was earlier this month and then before that. You know , it's very sporadic for me to be able to break away from my daily job of reporting and talking to sources and , you know , hitting sort of daily blogs here and there , it's very rare that I just get to that. I'm told to , okay , Levi , dip out , go play a video game for a couple hours and then come back. So that's one misconception that as gamers , that's all we're doing is just playing video games , which if you're an esports player , that might be true , but you're also studying , you're watching YouTube videos , you're watching your streams back to see how you performed. You're watching other people play to see how they're playing , if there are tips , tricks. Guidance that you can get on in the case of Smash Bros , mastering your character. I think another misconception is that knowledge gap , the fact that while you can play video games , that doesn't always translate to understanding esports , if that makes sense.\\n\\nS3:\\n\\nS2: Easy , Absolutely. The passion. Earlier this year , I wrote a story about a professional smash player. This player was expected to do really well in a tournament , but he got eliminated kind of early. And obviously being such a professional player , such a skilled player , that hurt him. And after sort of sitting in his chair for a few seconds and just letting the defeat sink into him , he then threw his controller on the ground and it bounced back up and it was caught on stream. And , you know , people had their videos out and they were recording. That , I think , is why people are so fascinated by esports , the narratives , the passion , the drive for players to get better , improve when they're tournaments or even if they lose. It's the aftermath of it , too. If you think about the mental gymnastics that go into outperforming and outsmarting another equally skilled player , it's electric.\\n\\nS1: That was Midday Edition producer Andrew Bracken speaking with Levi Winslow , a staff writer at Kotaku. We'd love to hear from you all about esports. What games are you playing and what has gaming meant to you ? Give us a call at (619) 452-0228. You can leave a message or you can email us at midday at pbs.org. Coming up.\\n\\nS4: I would say at UCSD , we have a really tight knit gaming community. And I think that Triton gaming and the other gaming organizations on campus , I've really helped foster that.\\n\\nS1: A look at collegiate esports and the community it builds. You're listening to Kpbs Midday Edition. You're listening to Kpbs Midday Edition. I'm Jade Hindman. We've been talking about the gaming and esports scene here in San Diego. While gaming and esports can be highly competitive , it can also be a way to bond with the community. That's the case at the collegiate level. UC San Diego is a unique case. It has both an active esports team and a gaming organization that puts events together for the community. Here to talk more about the local gaming and e-sports scene are Jordan Nishi , president of Triton Gaming Jordan. Hi.\\n\\nS4:\\n\\nS1: Also joining us , Campbell Moko , the recreational eSports programming lead at UCSD campus. Welcome to you.\\n\\nS5: Thank you. I'm very excited to be here.\\n\\nS1: Glad to have you both. Could each of you tell me about how you first got into gaming ? That's always interesting to me. So , Jordan , I'll start with you. Yeah.\\n\\nS4: Yeah. So I think I've been playing video games since before I could even read. I remember playing on my Nintendo DS and having my dad read the instructions to me. But video games have always been a large part of my life and they've acted as a way for me to build stronger bonds with my friends. A lot of people see video games as kind of being an isolated medium , but for me , I really think that they have a really strong social aspect to them.\\n\\nS1:\\n\\nS5: I also started pretty young on a Nintendo DS and were playing a new Super Mario Bros. Pretty much right when it came out. And then from there , also similar to Jordan , I just kind of expanded my tastes into new games. And as I grew up and it just kind of turned to something that just stuck with me.\\n\\nS1: Jordan How would you describe the gaming community on campus ? Yeah.\\n\\nS4: So I would say at UCSD , we have a really tight knit gaming community. And I think that Triton Gaming and the other gaming organizations on campus , I've really helped foster that. I tried to gaming our events , really focus on community outreach and providing a place for people to get to know each other better , have a fun time at our events. And I would say that we have a really , really engaging community here.\\n\\nS1: And you recently organized the Triton Gaming Expo last May , and there was a huge turnout for that. A couple of big figures in gaming were also there streamers , competitive esports players , game designers , industry experts. So tell us more about how the event went.\\n\\nS4: Yeah , that's correct. So we just hosted Triton Gaming Expo from May 20th 7 to 28. It went really , really well. We had a record breaking number of attendees. We had about 1700 unique people come to the event and they're able to see large personalities like Lilli Pichu , voice actors from Genshin Impact and Animes. And we also had industry professionals from Riot games come to talk about students , about how they could get their foot in the door of the gaming industry. So I think for attendees , they really , really had a valuable and exciting experience.\\n\\nS1: And really reaching a diverse population on campus was a priority for you. So how did you manage to do that ? Yeah.\\n\\nS4: So the biggest thing that we wanted to prevent with Triton Gaming Expo is just making it an event for just hardcore gamers or esports enthusiasts. We really tried for the event to be appealing to everyone. So one of the ways we did that is the event is completely free for anyone to attend. So if you're just even slightly interested , you can come check it out. But we also made sure to include other aspects of the event that weren't exclusive to gaming. We had a really large artist alley where we've had local San Diego artists set up vendor booths and sell their art. And we also have a lot of free play stations for just people to come and try play games. Just a very casual experience. And we had a lot of industry experts like riot games come. So even if you aren't super into hardcore gaming , you can still gain valuable experience about your future career.\\n\\nS1: That's really cool. So let's shift to esports.\\n\\nS5: So we recently , last March , opened our Triton E-sports center , which is now a free to use on campus space where anyone can come in and sit down and use some incredibly powerful computers that were provided to us by MSI that they can just sit down and use for free. And that's opened up a lot of avenues for us to kind of start programming in the space and try and get more people in. We have been having a lot of success with just people coming in on a regular basis. I don't know if you've been by , but if you go on a weekday and not during the summer , the place gets pretty packed at around 9 a.m. and it opens at eight. So we we couldn't have asked for better numbers , but we're still trying to kind of allow a lot of these on campus clubs to use this space for kind of whatever they need. And then we also use it to host our our intramurals. We have intramural sports programs that have started since the winter of this year. And we we've been using the training sports center to host their like finals and try and make them kind of an event more than just something for the ten players.\\n\\nS1: You know , it sounds like both of you have really found ways to to sort of broaden the audience and the participants for esports and gaming on campus. But I heard you all mentioned something about careers. So I'm curious to know what type of careers can come out of this sport.\\n\\nS5: Well , at least from my experience , you can kind of do almost anything. One of the things that I think a lot of people miss about esports is that every , every esports org is just a company. You know , they have the same the same roles , they have the same people , the same business dev people , they have the same operations people , they have the same social media people. It's all like part of the same things that like , you know , Twitter would have. So it's pretty , pretty much anything. A lot of what I do specifically is like business ops and like management , but you can kind of do anything in e-sports.\\n\\nS1: It seems like UCSD eSports program has grown a lot in the past few years. You mentioned the Triton eSports Center just opened on campus just last year and there's more funding for scholarships.\\n\\nS5: Thanks a lot. In part to our school. We've been getting a lot of support from the school , which not a lot of e-sports programs can say that they have. But also we've been kind of getting a lot of support from our community. We have a lot of people coming , as I said , coming into the sports center every day. We have a lot of people showing up to our events and it just kind of helps show the school that like even though we've only been around for 4 or 5 years , we're definitely worth the the time and money they've been sinking into us.\\n\\nS1: You're listening to Kpbs Midday Edition. I'm Jade Hindman speaking with Jordan Nishi , president of Triton Gaming and Camp Momoko Recreational eSports programming lead at UCSD , talking about finding community and gaming.\\n\\nS6:\\n\\nS5: Officer applications for the esports team and organizations which happened a couple times a year , usually once a quarter. And that's where we try to welcome people into the org and try and find spots for people who might not want to compete but still want to help out. So we have people like we have a creative team who makes all of our matchday graphics and all of our overlays. We have a marketing team which does all of our like social media posts. Yeah , we try and find a spot for everybody in Jordan.\\n\\nS1:\\n\\nS4: I feel like at UCSD we really have a lot of opportunities with them , or at least for Triton Game Expo , we were able to reserve the university's ballrooms completely for free. And they. Have an amazing tech support team that sets up our events , which do have a lot of technical logistic work to do with them. So being able to work at the university to market and set up our events has really been a great experience this past year and I'm really glad that we have them as a resource.\\n\\nS1: Yeah , and it sounds like Triton Gaming and UCSD eSports really work in tandem. So how do the two organizations work together to really build that sense of community ? Yeah.\\n\\nS4: So Triton Gaming and UCSD Sports were sister organizations and we partner with each other and a lot of our events at Triton Gaming Expo , we actually had UCSD eSports play in show matches on stage at the event. So we had ten computers up on the ballroom stage and we had esports players playing against each other in games. And it was a really fun experience to see players playing live. The players liked it , the audience liked it. It was it was a great experience.\\n\\nS1: You touched on on how gaming can be seen as isolating. I'm curious , how has gaming helped either of you , Jordan or Campbell , connect with others ? What what have you heard from others as well ? Yeah.\\n\\nS4: So Triton gaming , it's it's really formed a strong social network for me on campus. The people in Triton gaming are some of my closest friends and it's just really great to be able to work on projects that you're passionate about with people that you hold closely. But it's also just a great sense of gratification for me in my life. It provides a lot of motivation. Some of my most memorable experiences at our events are talking with attendees and just just hearing that they've had a fun time. To me , that's just one of the most gratifying experiences is just seeing that you've made a positive impact on the greater community. It's it's just such a great feeling.\\n\\nS5: I definitely have similar thoughts to Jordan. I know I actually met Jordan through the gaming community on campus and we went from , you know , not really knowing each other to working with each other pretty much every day to , you know , becoming great friends over in the span of like half a year. And I couldn't be more thankful for that aspect of the gaming community.\\n\\nS1: That is an important aspect. I've been speaking with Jordan Nishi , president of Triton Gaming and Campus Recreational eSports Programming lead at UCSD. Thank you both for joining us.\\n\\nS5: Yeah , thank you so much. We definitely appreciate the opportunity to be able to talk about our experiences.\\n\\nS4: Yeah , Thank you so much. It's been great talking to you.\\n\\nS1: Coming up , we'll explore how kids are learning Stem skills and building relationships through one San Diego eSports program.\\n\\nS7: I'm learning so much from them , honestly , when it comes to just seeing how they interact with one another , how to play properly , learning good sportsmanship , and we're just growing with each other.\\n\\nS1: Midday Edition is back after the break. You're listening to Kpbs Midday Edition. I'm Jade Hindman. We've been talking about esports and the growing gaming community in San Diego. If you've ever played video games with the kids at home , this might sound familiar to you. Oh , my. God.\\n\\nS8: God. There's literally three seconds left.\\n\\nS9: No , no. Oh , my God. No , no , no.\\n\\nS8: Well , now it's even. I feel like I used to this year.\\n\\nS1: I used to. Using Kirby. You're hearing the sound of kids playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate a crossover fighting game. It's a massively popular game with an audience that ranges from children to professional e-sports players. And while esports leagues are often concentrated in high schools and colleges , one local esports program is focusing on younger kids and teens. Their goal is to create a safe space for young people to play and develop their gaming prowess , while also building a tight knit community that helps them find their niche. Here to talk more about that program is Kristian Chamberlain. He is the digital enrichment coordinator at YMCA Mission Valley. Christian , welcome. Hello.\\n\\nS7: Hello. Hello. Thank you for having me.\\n\\nS1: Glad to have you.\\n\\nS7: I grew up playing Smash Brothers from the N64 on , so absolutely love that game as it holds a special place in my heart. But with the esports community I actually am pretty fresh to it as far as it goes. Y-m-c-a gave us a wonderful opportunity to branch into esports. It's something that all of YMCA USA is trying to really break into. But here in San Diego , I feel like we've made some massive traction and it's been just a lot of fun working with the youth and now expanding to the teens and hopefully soon 18 and up leagues as well out of our new studio.\\n\\nS1: So much has changed in the gaming world. When I was little , it was all about Super Mario Brothers , and that's still top game to me. I don't know.\\n\\nS7: Oh , it's still a classic. Everybody loves it. And actually we had some teens in the center and about six of them just wanted to play Mario Brothers. And we're like , okay , let's get it set up. Here we go. Let's keep it. Classic.\\n\\nS1: Classic. It's great , you know ? So so tell me , how does the program at the YMCA actually work ? Yeah.\\n\\nS7: So actually over the past year , we've had some amazing participation where it was just purely virtual. So the kids were playing from home and they would interact with us via Discord or other voice or video chats where they were talking directly to Y staff. We set up tournaments that way. We had in-person meetups so that the kids can get comfortable with one another. But with our new remodel that we just finished , we're bringing all the esports in-house. So we're going to be following an in-person setup where all the kids are going to be going up against one another. eSports for Smash Brothers is very specific with the rules though , so it is 1V1. So it's a skill based game , right ? So while it still is a team sport because we're trying to cultivate that , think of it more of a something similar to wrestling. Wrestling is a team sport , but it is individual at the same time , right ? So that's kind of the the model that we are following and it's going great. So it's three lives , five minutes and just whoever wins , wins , no items , anything like that. So you're learning a new skill and you're just getting better at the game as it progresses. And what's awesome is the kids are showing amazing growth. So we actually keep a win percentage of their record throughout the entire season so that they can see their growth and the parents can see that and track it as well so that they know that they're getting something out of it. So it's just an amazing time , honestly. Right.\\n\\nS1: Right.\\n\\nS7: It's really is a dream come true. Coming from my previous backgrounds and retail for 16 years to now , this this is an amazing opportunity to be able to teach the youth and watch them grow. And I'm learning so much from them , honestly , when it comes to just seeing how they interact with one another , how to play properly , learning good sportsmanship. And we're just growing with each other. And it's just it's been phenomenal to watch that happen.\\n\\nS1: And you recently reopened the digital studios at the YMCA. We actually spoke to some of the kids and their parents. Their one parent beta into has been bringing her son Derek to the eSports league for about a year and a half. And , you know , she really believes it helped him find his niche. Take a listen.\\n\\nS10: I firmly believe that it's not so much gaming in and of itself that's isolating. It's , you know , trying to find that sense of community , like not all kids are going to be baseball players or play basketball and that kind of sporting , you know , environment. But it's nice that the Y is doing e-sports to attract a different community. And I think , you know , my son in particular , he's. Been able to find his tribe. So I think that's a huge plus. Yeah.\\n\\nS1: And another parent , Joan Grace , also liked that gaming brought kids together.\\n\\nS11: You're still playing a video game , but it's , you know , having this sense of community with other people. And , you know , you can hear it , too , like all the laughter and , you know , other people just kind of buzzing around.\\n\\nS1: I mean , so it sounds like the esports program has really helped these kids find their community , find their tribe. Tell us more about that.\\n\\nS7: It's been really amazing watching these kids like Open Up and Blossom. Derrick has been with us for quite a while , and I actually remember the first time we had an in-person meetup and Derrick showed up. So one of our other participants was there first. He had his security blanket with him. He was really nervous , didn't really know how to interact with us because he had only heard my voice and seen my video a few times throughout the season. But as soon as he heard Derek's voice , whenever he came into the room , he just knew and the two of them just clicked instantly. They've been buddies ever since. They chat a lot now. They even play games outside of our esports community and it's just amazing to watch him learn and grow. And one of the things I'm going to start challenging Derek with actually , and I spoke with his mother Peta , about this , is he has the capacity to now learn and coach the new kids that are coming in. So with the in-person model , we're going to try and set up little mini leaders that can teach the kids who are new to the game because we actually have a lot of kids who've never played Smash Brothers before that join our league. And by the end of it , they actually show a lot of growth and , you know , become very well skilled at the game after a couple seasons with us , which is amazing to see.\\n\\nS1: Yeah , I mean in esports and competitive gaming , also part of $1 billion industry there. Many college esports programs offer scholarships.\\n\\nS7: We do have some connections with UCSD. We were able to take our kids there during our first season ever. We got all the little seven , eight , nine year olds jerseys , which is amazing. And we all went to UCSD for a gaming expo but wanted to use that to broaden their minds a little bit because they can get scholarships to UCSD or get there's accredited programs at San Diego State currently for eSports management. So I'm making those connections now so that we can create a direct pipeline for them for these schools. And then after that , we do have companies that have been a part of us , not just in esports but in our robotics programs as well , because we teach quite a few things at the digital studio and so we're trying to get them when they're young , get them comfortable with the concepts , get them into college and then get them a job afterwards.\\n\\nS1: And video games are massively popular , but they still get a bad rap. Some parents worry that gaming can have a negative impact on their kids mental health. There's also concerns about screen time.\\n\\nS7: I mean , anything in moderation , right ? I mean , sure , gaming can be negative if you're using it too much , you're using it for the wrong reasons. I feel that gaming can be used as a connective tissue between multiple people. It's an instant connection with somebody like you. Both have this love for a game and you can then create a friendship from that or trying to make sure that you're keeping it at that social aspect itself , right ? Where yes , too much screen time is something that we constantly run into. A lot of parents are very concerned about that. They're concerned about the safe space that their kids are in , interacting with other players online. But we make sure to take care of all of those variables. So whenever we are in our esports league , you're only interacting with other participants that are in that program or with staff that have been properly trained how to handle behavioral issues or just how to handle the youth in general. So we try and cultivate this term of meaningful play. We're not here to just play video games. We're here to play games with the purpose. We want to make sure that we are learning new skills along the way , better hand-eye coordination , those things like that. But what's kind of amazing in some areas that I try and keep up with so that I can help better educate not just the kids , but the parents and other people who are interested in this program is that gaming even gets prescribed for ADHD currently along with other medications and things like that. But it is a supplementary tool that's being used for that , or it's even helped with dementia as well. It shows that 30 minutes a day playing certain types of games and specific ones , right ? More like puzzle games or 3D , 3D world games can actually help stop or hinder the effects of dementia or help boost your memory in a positive way. So gaming can get a bad rep. And it has. You know , throughout its inception , there's always been some sort of issue with it because certain games can push the envelope , but all media can do that , right ? Books , movies , everything. It just. All in moderation is what we try and harp on.\\n\\nS1: You're listening to Kpbs Midday Edition. I'm Jade Hindman. I've been speaking with Kristian Chamberlin , the digital enrichment coordinator at YMCA Mission Valley. We've been talking about esports for youth and the benefit of gaming for kids. Christian gaming culture and online culture in general can become very toxic as you were just touching on , especially if left unmonitored.\\n\\nS7: After every single match , you say good game. We had it as a virtual aspect , but when the kids are going to be in person , they're going to shake each other's hands , Win or lose. It's something that I learned whenever I grew up. And I was a wrestler and I was a wrestling coach. We drilled that into our kids because it just shows good sportsmanship. And then after that , we start tailoring the language that they're actually using. It can be very violent. Some of the terms that are used , I understand that. It's just it's natural. But we try and hinder that or find replacement words to then make it less violent , make it more comfortable for everybody , because it can be a little chaotic if someone just passing by and just hears , you know , I'm going to kill you , I'm going to get you right. Like we try and hinder that. We change the verbiage so that it's , you know , proper. It's not. It's polite. And we're actually paying attention to other children's needs. And another thing , too , that we work on is learning how to lose properly. A lot of these kids are still new to this concept and maybe they've tried out sports that just didn't work out for them. And then they come in and they might lose a match and now they're starting to feel like this isn't a place for me either. But no one has taken the time to really teach them how to lose properly and what they can actually learn from it. Because I've always , always taught that you can learn a lot more from losing than you can from winning. There's always something to grow on if you lost , right ? And then you start looking at what kind of plays did the other kid do ? That led to my ultimate defeat , right ? And then you start creating a plan. You start drafting up better ways to drill , how to practice more. And it's it's a learning process for everyone. But so far , everything has been going really great. And a lot of the kids in my programs that have been with me for multiple season actually now , self police , the new kids. So if a new child comes in and they start , you know , saying things that might be inappropriate before I can even get to it , some of my kids are calling them out and just letting them know , hey , I'm not comfortable with the way that you or what you just said. Maybe we can try something different. Right. And or they just don't acknowledge it. Everyone knows not to acknowledge things that we don't want to continue , so we don't reward bad behavior that way. And it just it handles itself now. And it's kind of amazing to see that these kids who are 8 to 12 years old , being this adult and this responsible online because it can be , like you said , incredibly toxic. It's a it's a tough area to be in , for sure. Yeah.\\n\\nS1: And a lot of parents might be concerned about their kids gaming habits at home.\\n\\nS7: I mean , I grew up in a basically the Wild West of gaming where there wasn't really the Internet or I mean , we had dial up. That's about it. Right ? But there was in the Internet , there wasn't Twitter , there wasn't all these amazing things to quickly understand. What is this game actually about ? And I got away with playing a lot of games that I shouldn't have played whenever I was a child. We can monitor that better as parents , as guardians , and really pay attention not just to the Esrb rating , but the actual content that's there because a lot of games nowadays are using them as a tool to discuss really heavy issues in our community. And some of them might you might feel like our maybe two adults or two inappropriate for your child right now , or maybe it's just a way to open the door to a better conversation about a certain type of topic , right ? Whether it's something about the government , whether it's about gender equality , things like that. That's all being discussed in games in the background. Right. And it's a really great way to create a bridge between a child and a parent to try and give them a better understanding of the world around them. But like I said , as a parent , I would just recommend really doing your research on some of these games because there are certain ones where it might seem , you know , very kiddie , childish , very simple on the surface , but there's a deeper meaning behind it. It might warrant a better conversation between the parent and the child.\\n\\nS1: And , you know , while e-sports can be a positive social program , as you just kind of talked about , you know , it can also be a good component to a well-rounded Stem education. So how does that work ? How does esports support Stem education ? Yeah.\\n\\nS7: So during our esports programs , we actually like to discuss how the game actually works. So whenever a participant might get frustrated , like , oh , I , I know I hit them or I press this button at the right time and it just didn't work out the way that they wanted. Then I start explaining hitboxes things like that , the background of the game , what makes it actually run ? Because I have my degree in game design , so I really like discussing that aspect with the children. And then what we do is we let them know , Well , we offer game design classes so you can get a better understanding of that. So for youth and teens , we actually have game design classes where they can learn to code , they can get comfortable with that concept , create their own games , and then we send the games home with them so they can share it with their families and show off what they made. On top of that , we like to discuss the potential jobs that they can have outside of school , whether it's with , you know , level design , it's marketing , shout casting. There's all kinds of different avenues that go into this. So we're constantly trying to educate them on what possible features they have , as well as what offerings we're able to provide for them to gain a better understanding of games , not just playing them , but making them understanding them , the psychology behind them and everything in between.\\n\\nS1:\\n\\nS7: I mean , so far we've seen some amazing growth over the past year. So last year in our first season we had eight participants in our league and then this past spring we actually had 52 participants across multiple sites , which was an amazing explosion of kids that we had we got to be able to work with. And then starting in the fall , we're actually going to be in five elementary schools and we are in talks with all the YMCA in San Diego to help start leagues of their own. And what's great is that they don't need a physical space to do that. They can run virtual leagues or I can assist them in. They can join our league itself , but we just want to expand as far as possible , reach as many kids as possible and just show them another avenue , another path that they can take to their future.\\n\\nS1: I've been speaking with Christian Chamberlain , the digital enrichment coordinator at YMCA Mission Valley. Christian , thank you so much for joining us.\\n\\nS7: Yeah , thank you so much. It's been amazing talking to you guys.\\n\\nS1: We'd love to hear from you. Are you a gamer ? If so , what has playing esports meant to you ? Give us a call at (619) 452-0228. You can leave a message or you can email us at midday at pbs.org. Join us again tomorrow at noon. We'll be talking about climate change and what local solutions look like. Don't forget to catch Evening Edition tonight at five on Kpbs television for in-depth reporting on San Diego issues. And if you ever miss a show. You can find the Midday edition podcast wherever you listen. I'm Jade Hindman. Thanks for tuning in.\"}]}]"
