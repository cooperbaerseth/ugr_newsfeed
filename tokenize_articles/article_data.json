Google DeepMind is the result of an internal merger: Google acquired Demis\\u2019 DeepMind startup in 2014 and ran it as a separate company inside its parent company, Alphabet, while Google itself had an AI team called Google Brain.\\n\\nGoogle has been showing off AI demos for years now, but with the explosion of ChatGPT and a renewed threat from Microsoft in search, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai made the decision to bring DeepMind into Google itself earlier this year to create\\u2026 Google DeepMind.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s interesting is that Google Brain and DeepMind were not necessarily compatible or even focused on the same things: DeepMind was famous for applying AI to things like games and protein-folding simulations. The AI that beat world champions at Go, the ancient board game? That was DeepMind\\u2019s AlphaGo. Meanwhile, Google Brain was more focused on what\\u2019s come to be the familiar generative AI toolset: large language models for chatbots, editing features in Google Photos, and so on. This was a culture clash and a big structure decision with the goal of being more competitive and faster to market with AI products.\\n\\nAnd the competition isn\\u2019t just OpenAI and Microsoft \\u2014 you might have seen a memo from a Google engineer floating around the web recently claiming that Google has no competitive moat in AI because open-source models running on commodity hardware are rapidly evolving and catching up to the tools run by the giants. Demis confirmed that the memo was real but said it was part of Google\\u2019s debate culture, and he disagreed with it because he has other ideas about where Google\\u2019s competitive edge might come into play.\\n\\nOf course, we also talked about AI risk and especially artificial general intelligence. Demis is not shy that his goal is building an AGI, and we talked through what risks and regulations should be in place and on what timeline. Demis recently signed onto a 22-word statement about AI risk with OpenAI\\u2019s Sam Altman and others that simply reads, \\u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\\u201d That\\u2019s pretty chill, but is that the real risk right now? Or is it just a distraction from other more tangible problems like AI replacing a bunch of labor in various creative industries? We also talked about the new kinds of labor AI is creating \\u2014 armies of low-paid taskers classifying data in countries like Kenya and India in order to train AI systems. We just published a big feature on these taskers. I wanted to know if Demis thought these jobs were here to stay or just a temporary side effect of the AI boom.\\n\\nThis one really hits all the Decoder high points: there\\u2019s the big idea of AI, a lot of problems that come with it, an infinite array of complicated decisions to be made, and of course, a gigantic org chart decision in the middle of it all. Demis and I got pretty in the weeds, and I still don\\u2019t think we covered it all, so we\\u2019ll have to have him back soon.\\n\\nAlright, Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind. Here we go.\\n\\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity\\n\\nDemis Hassabis, you are the CEO of Google DeepMind. Welcome to Decoder.\\n\\nThanks for having me.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t think we have ever had a more perfect Decoder guest. There\\u2019s a big idea in AI. It comes with challenges and problems, and then, with you in particular, there\\u2019s a gigantic org chart move and a set of high-stakes decisions to be made. I am thrilled that you are here.\\n\\nGlad to be here.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s start with Google DeepMind itself. Google DeepMind is a new part of Google that is constructed of two existing parts of Google. There was Google Brain, which was the AI team we were familiar with as we covered Google that was run by Jeff Dean. And there was DeepMind, which was your company that you founded. You sold it to Alphabet in 2014. You were outside of Google. It was run as a separate company inside that holding company Alphabet structure until just now. Start at the very beginning. Why were DeepMind and Google Brain separate to begin with?\\n\\nAs you mentioned, we started DeepMind actually back in 2010, a long time ago now, especially in the age of AI. So that\\u2019s sort of like prehistory. Myself and the co-founders, we realized coming from academia and seeing what was going on there, things like deep learning had just been invented. We were big proponents of reinforcement learning. We could see GPUs and other hardware was coming online, that a lot of great progress could be made with a focused effort on general learning systems and also taking some ideas from neuroscience and how the brain works. So we put all those ingredients together back in 2010. We had this thesis we\\u2019d make fast progress, and that\\u2019s what happened with our initial game systems. And then, we decided in 2014 to join forces with Google at the time because we could see that a lot more compute was going to be needed. Obviously, Google has the most computers and had the most computers in the world. That was the obvious home for us to be able to focus on pushing the research as fast as possible.\\n\\nSo you were acquired by Google, and then somewhere along the way, Google reoriented itself. They turned into Alphabet, and Google became a division of Alphabet. There are other divisions of Alphabet, and DeepMind was out of it. That\\u2019s just the part I want to focus on here at the beginning, because there was what Google was doing with Google Brain, which is a lot of LLM research. I recall, six years ago, Google was showing off LLMs at Google I/O, but DeepMind was focused on winning the game [Go] and protein folding, a very different kind of AI research wholly outside of Google. Why was that outside of Google? Why was that in Alphabet proper?\\n\\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \\u2014 and other problems. Subscribe here!\\n\\nThat was part of the agreement as we were acquired was that we would pursue pushing forward research into general AI, or sometimes called AGI, a system that out of the box can operate across a wide range of cognitive tasks and basically has all the cognitive capabilities that humans have.\\n\\nAnd also using AI to accelerate scientific discovery, that\\u2019s one of my personal passions. And that explains projects like AlphaFold that I\\u2019m sure we\\u2019re going to get back to. But also, from the start of DeepMind and actually prior to even DeepMind starting, I believe that games was a perfect testing or proving ground for developing AI algorithms efficiently, quickly, and you can generate a lot of data and the objective functions are very clear: obviously, winning games or maximizing the score. There were a lot of reasons to use games in the early days of AI research, and that was a big part of why we were so successful and why we were able to advance so quickly with things like AlphaGo, the program that beat the world champion at the ancient game of Go.\\n\\nThose were all really important proof points for the whole field really that these general learning techniques would work. And of course we\\u2019ve done a lot of work on deep learning and neural networks as well. And our specialty, I suppose, was combining that with reinforcement learning to allow these systems to actively solve problems and make plans and do things like win games. And in terms of the differences, we always had that remit to push the research agenda and push things, advanced science. And that was very much the focus we were given and very much the focus that I wanted to have. And then, the internal Google AI teams like Google Brain, they had slightly different remits and were a bit closer to product and obviously to the rest of Google and infusing Google with amazing AI technology. And we also had an applied division that was introducing DeepMind technology into Google products, too. But the cultures were quite different, and the remits were quite different.\\n\\nFrom the outside, the timeline looks like this: everyone\\u2019s been working on this for ages, we\\u2019ve all been talking about it for ages. It is a topic of conversation for a bunch of nerdy journalists like me, a bunch of researchers, we talk about it in the corner at Google events.\\n\\nThen ChatGPT is released, not even as a product. I don\\u2019t even think Sam [Altman] would call it a great product when it was released, but it was just released, and people could use it. And everyone freaked out, and Microsoft releases Bing based on ChatGPT, and the world goes upside down, and Google reacts by merging DeepMind and Google Brain. That\\u2019s what it looks like from the outside. Is that what it felt like from the inside?\\n\\nThat timeline is correct, but it\\u2019s not these direct consequences; it\\u2019s more indirect in a sense. So, Google and Alphabet have always run like this. They let many flowers bloom, and I think that\\u2019s always been the way that even from Larry [Page] and Sergey [Brin] from the beginning set up Google. And it served them very well, and it\\u2019s allowed them to organically create incredible things and become the amazing company that it is today. On the research side, I think it\\u2019s very compatible with doing research, which is another reason we chose Google as our partners back in 2014. I felt they really understood what fundamental and blue sky research was, ambitious research was, and they were going to facilitate us being and enable us to be super ambitious with our research. And you\\u2019ve seen the results of that, right?\\n\\n\\u201c...AI has entered a new era.\\u201d\\n\\nBy any measure, AlphaGo, AlphaFold, but more than 20 nature and science papers and so on \\u2014 all the normal metrics one would use for really delivering amazing cutting-edge research we were able to do. But in a way, what ChatGPT and the large models and the public reaction to that confirmed is that AI has entered a new era. And by the way, it was a little bit surprising for all of us at the coalface, including OpenAI, how viral that went because \\u2014 us and some other startups like Anthropic and OpenAI \\u2014 we all had these large language models. They were roughly the same capabilities.\\n\\nAnd so, it was surprising, not so much what the technology was because we all understood that, but the public\\u2019s appetite for that and obviously the buzz that generated. And I think that\\u2019s indicative of something we\\u2019ve all been feeling for the last, I would say, two, three years, which is these systems are reaching a level of maturity now and sophistication where it can really come out of the research phase and the lab and go into powering incredible next-generation products and experiences and also breakthroughs, things like AlphaFold directly being useful for biologists. And so, to me, this is just indicative of a new phase that AI is in of being practically useful to people in their everyday lives and actually being able to solve really hard real-world problems that really matter, not just the curiosities or fun, like games.\\n\\nWhen you recognize that shift, then I think that necessitates a change in your approach as to how you\\u2019re approaching the research and how much focus you\\u2019re having on products and those kinds of things. And I think that\\u2019s what we all came to the realization of, which was: now was the time to streamline our AI efforts and focus them more. And the obvious conclusion of that was to do the merger.\\n\\nI want to just stop there for one second and ask a philosophical question.\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nIt feels like the ChatGPT moment that led to this AI explosion this year was really rooted in the AI being able to do something that regular people could do. I want you to write me an email, I want you to write me a screenplay, and maybe the output of the LLM is a C+, but it\\u2019s still something I can do. People can see it. I want you to fill out the rest of this photo. That\\u2019s something people can imagine doing. Maybe they don\\u2019t have the skills to do it, but they can imagine doing it. All the previous AI demos that we have gotten, even yours, AlphaFold, you\\u2019re like, this is going to model all the proteins in the world.\\n\\nBut I can\\u2019t do that; a computer should do that. Even a microbiologist might think, \\u201cThat is great. I\\u2019m very excited that a computer can do that because I\\u2019m just looking at how much time it would take us, and there\\u2019s no way we could ever do it.\\u201d \\u201cI want to beat the world champion at Go. I can\\u2019t do that. It\\u2019s like, fine. A computer can do that.\\u201d\\n\\nThere\\u2019s this turn where the computer is starting to do things I can do, and they\\u2019re not even necessarily the most complicated tasks. Read this webpage and deliver a summary of it to me. But that\\u2019s the thing that unlocked everyone\\u2019s brain. And I\\u2019m wondering why you think the industry didn\\u2019t see that turn coming because we\\u2019ve been very focused on these very difficult things that people couldn\\u2019t do, and it seems like what got everyone is when the computer started doing things people do all the time.\\n\\nI think that analysis is correct. I think that is why the large language models have really entered the public consciousness because it\\u2019s something the average person, that the \\u201cJoe Public,\\u201d can actually understand and interact with. And, of course, language is core to human intelligence and our everyday lives. I think that does explain why chatbots specifically have gone viral in the way they have. Even though I would say things like AlphaFold, I mean of course I\\u2019d be biased in saying this, but I think it\\u2019s actually had the most unequivocally biggest beneficial effects so far in AI on the world because if you talk to any biologist or there\\u2019s a million biologists now, researchers and medical researchers, have used AlphaFold. I think that\\u2019s nearly every biologist in the world. Every Big Pharma company is using it to advance their drug discovery programs. I\\u2019ve had multiple, dozens, of Nobel Prize-winner-level biologists and chemists talk to me about how they\\u2019re using AlphaFold.\\n\\nSo a certain set of all the world\\u2019s scientists, let\\u2019s say, they all know AlphaFold, and it\\u2019s affected and massively accelerated their important research work. But of course, the average person in the street doesn\\u2019t know what proteins are even and doesn\\u2019t know what the importance of those things are for things like drug discovery. Whereas obviously, for a chatbot, everyone can understand, this is incredible. And it\\u2019s very visceral to get it to write you a poem or something that everybody can understand and process and measure compared to what they do or are able to do.\\n\\nIt seems like that is the focus of productized AI: these chatbot-like interfaces or these generative products that are going to make stuff for people, and that\\u2019s where the risk has been focused. But even the conversation about risk has escalated because people can now see, \\u201cOh, these tools can do stuff.\\u201d Did you perceive the same level of scrutiny when you were working on AlphaFold? It doesn\\u2019t seem like anyone thought, \\u201cOh, AlphaFold\\u2019s going to destroy humanity.\\u201d\\n\\nNo, but there was a lot of scrutiny, but again, it was in a very specialized area, right? With renowned experts, and actually, we did talk to over 30 experts in the field, from top biologists to bioethicists to biosecurity people, and actually our partners \\u2014 we partnered with the European Bioinformatics Institute to release the AlphaFold database of all the protein structures, and they guided us as well on how this could be safely put out there. So there was a lot of scrutiny, and the overwhelming conclusion from the people we consulted was that the benefits far outweighed any risks. Although we did make some small adjustments based on their feedback about which structures to release. But there was a lot of scrutiny, but again, it\\u2019s just in a very expert domain. And just going back to your first question about the generative models, I do think we are right at the beginning of an incredible new era that\\u2019s going to play out over the next five, 10 years.\\n\\nNot only in advancing science with AI but in terms of the types of products we can build to improve people\\u2019s everyday lives, billions of people in their everyday lives, and help them to be more efficient and to enrich their lives. And I think what we\\u2019re seeing today with these chatbots is literally just scratching the surface. There are a lot more types of AI than generative AI. Generative AI is now the \\u201cin\\u201d thing, but I think that planning and deep reinforcement learning and problem-solving and reasoning, those kinds of capabilities are going to come back in the next wave after this, along with the current capabilities of the current systems. So I think, in a year or two\\u2019s time, if we were to talk again, we are going to be talking about entirely new types of products and experiences and services with never-seen-before capabilities. And I\\u2019m very excited about building those things, actually. And that\\u2019s one of the reasons I\\u2019m very excited about leading Google DeepMind now in this new era and focusing on building these AI-powered next-generation products.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s stay in the weeds of Google DeepMind itself, for one more turn. Sundar Pichai comes to you and says, \\u201cAll right, I\\u2019m the CEO of Alphabet and the CEO of Google. I can just make this call. I\\u2019m going to bring DeepMind into Google, merge you with Google Brain, you\\u2019re going to be the CEO.\\u201d How did you react to that prompt?\\n\\nIt wasn\\u2019t like that. It was much more of a conversation between the leaders of the various different relevant groups and Sundar about pretty much the inflection point that we\\u2019re seeing, the maturity of the systems, what could be possible with those in the product space, and how to improve experiences for our users, our billions of users, and how exciting that might be, and what that all requires in totality. Both the change in focus, a change in the approach to research, the combination of resources that are required, like compute resources. So there was a big collection of factors to take into account that we all discussed as a leadership group, and then, conclusions from that then result in actions, including the merger and also what the plans are then for the next couple of years and what the focus should be of that merged unit.\\n\\nDo you perceive a difference being a CEO inside of Google versus being a CEO inside of Alphabet?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s still early days, but I think it\\u2019s been pretty similar because, although DeepMind was an Alphabet company, it was very unusual for another bet, as they call it an \\u201calpha bet,\\u201d which is that we already were very closely integrated and collaborating with many of the Google product area teams and groups. We had an applied team at DeepMind whose job it was to translate our research work into features in products by collaborating with the Google product teams. And so, we\\u2019ve had hundreds of successful launches already actually over the last few years, just quiet ones behind the scenes. So, in fact, many of the services or devices or systems that you use every day at Google will have some DeepMind technology under the hood as a component. So we already had that integrative structure, and then, of course, what we were famous for was doing the scientific advances and gaming advances, but behind the scenes, there was a lot of bread and butter work going on that was affecting all parts of Google.\\n\\nWe were different from other bets where they have to make a business outside of Google and become an independent business. That was never the goal or the remit for us, even as an independent bet company. And now, within Google, we\\u2019re just more tightly integrated in terms of the product services, and I see that as an advantage because we can actually go deeper and do more exciting and ambitious things in much closer collaboration with these other product teams than we could from outside of Google. But we still retain some latitude to pick the processes and the systems that optimize our mission of producing the most capable and general AI systems in the world.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s been reporting that this is actually a culture clash. You\\u2019re now in charge of both. How have you structured the group? How has Google DeepMind structured under you as CEO, and how are you managing that culture integration?\\n\\nActually, it turns out that the culture\\u2019s a lot more similar than perhaps has been reported externally. And in the end, it\\u2019s actually been surprisingly smooth and pleasant because you\\u2019re talking about two world-class research groups, two of the best AI research organizations in the world, incredible talent on both sides, storied histories. As we were thinking about the merger and planning it, we were looking at some document where we listed the top 10 breakthroughs from each group. And when you take that in totality, it\\u2019s like 80\\u201390 percent of over the last decade, of the breakthroughs that underpin the modern AI industry, from deep reinforcement learning to transformers, of course. It\\u2019s an incredible set of people and talent, and there\\u2019s massive respect for both groups on both sides. And there was actually a lot of collaboration on a project-based level ongoing over the last decade.\\n\\nOf course, we all know each other very well. I just think it\\u2019s a question of focus and a bit of coordination across both groups, actually, and more in terms of what are we going to focus on, other places that it makes sense for the two separate teams to collaborate on, and maybe de-duplicate some efforts that basically are overlapping. So fairly obvious stuff, to be honest, but it\\u2019s important moving into this new phase now of where we are into more of an engineering phase of AI, and that requires huge resources, both compute, engineering, and other things. And, even as a company the size of Google, we\\u2019ve got to pick our bets carefully and be clear about which arrows we are going to put our wood behind and then focus on those and then massively deliver on those things. So I think it\\u2019s part of the natural course of evolution as to where we are in the AI journey.\\n\\nThat thing you talked about, \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to combine these groups, we\\u2019re going to pick what we\\u2019re doing, we\\u2019re going to de-duplicate some efforts.\\u201d Those are structure questions. Have you decided on a structure yet, and what do you think that structure will be?\\n\\nThe structure\\u2019s still evolving. We\\u2019re only a couple of months into it. We wanted to make sure we didn\\u2019t break anything, that it was working. Both teams are incredibly productive, doing super amazing research, but also plugging in to very important product things that are going on. All of that needs to continue.\\n\\nYou keep saying both teams. Do you think of it as two teams, or are you trying to make one team?\\n\\nNo, no, for sure it\\u2019s one unified team. I like to call it a \\u201csuper unit,\\u201d and I\\u2019m very excited about that. But obviously, we\\u2019re still combining that and forming the new culture and forming the new grouping, including the organizational structures. It\\u2019s a complex thing \\u2014 putting two big research groups together like this. But I think, by the end of the summer, we\\u2019ll be a single unified entity, and I think that\\u2019ll be very exciting. And we\\u2019re already feeling, even a couple of months in, the benefits and the strengths of that with projects like Gemini that you may have heard of, which is our next-generation multimodal large models \\u2014 very, very exciting work going on there, combining all the best ideas from across both world-class research groups. It\\u2019s pretty impressive to see.\\n\\nYou have a lot of decisions to make. What you\\u2019re describing is a bunch of complicated decisions and then, out in the world, how should we regulate this? Another set of very complicated decisions. You are a chess champion, you are a person who has made games. What is your framework for making decisions? I suspect it is much more rigorous than the other ones I hear about.\\n\\n\\u201cChess is basically decision-making under pressure with an opponent.\\u201d\\n\\nYes, I think it probably is. And I think if you play a game like chess that seriously \\u2014 effectively professionally \\u2014 since all my childhood, since the age of four, I think it\\u2019s very formative for your brain. So I think, in chess, the problem-solving and strategizing, I find it a very useful framework for many things and decision-making. Chess is basically decision-making under pressure with an opponent, and it\\u2019s very complex, and I think it\\u2019s a great thing. I advocate it being taught at school, part of the school curriculum, because I think it\\u2019s a really fantastic training ground for problem-solving and decision-making. But then, I think actually the overarching approach is more of the scientific method.\\n\\nSo I think all my training is doing my PhDs and postdocs and so on, obviously I did it in neuroscience, so I was learning about the brain, but it also taught me how to do rigorous hypothesis testing and hypothesis generation and then update based on empirical evidence. The whole scientific method as well as the chess planning, both can be translated into the business domain. You have to be smart about how to translate that, you can\\u2019t be academic about these things. And often, in the real world, in business, there\\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and hidden information that you don\\u2019t know. So, in chess, obviously all the information\\u2019s there for you on the board. You can\\u2019t just directly translate those skills, but I think, in the background, they can be very helpful if applied in the right way.\\n\\nHow do you combine those two in some decisions you\\u2019ve made?\\n\\nThere are so many decisions I make every day,it\\u2019s hard to come up with one now. But I tend to try and plan out and scenario a plan many, many years in advance. So I tell you the way I try to approach things is, I have an end goal. I\\u2019m quite good at imagining things, so that\\u2019s a different skill, visualizing or imagining what would a perfect end state look like, whether that\\u2019s organizational or it\\u2019s product-based or it\\u2019s research-based. And then, I work back from the end point and then figure out what all the steps would be required and in what order to make that outcome as likely as possible.\\n\\nSo that\\u2019s a little bit chess-like, right? In the sense of you have some plan that you would like to get to checkmate your opponent, but you\\u2019re many moves away from that. So what are the incremental things one must do to improve your position in order to increase the likelihood of that final outcome? And I found that extremely useful to do that search process from the end goal back to the current state that you find yourself in.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s put that next to some products. You said there\\u2019s a lot of DeepMind technology and a lot of Google products. The ones that we can all look at are Bard and then your Search Generative Experience. There\\u2019s AI in Google Photos and all this stuff, but focused on the LLM moment, it\\u2019s Bard and the Search Generative Experience. Those can\\u2019t be the end state. They\\u2019re not finished. Gemini is coming, and we\\u2019ll probably improve both of those, and all that will happen. When you think about the end state of those products, what do you see?\\n\\nThe AI systems around Google are also not just in the consumer-facing things but also under the hood that you may not realize. So even, for example, one of the things we applied our AI systems to very initially was the cooling systems in Google\\u2019s data centers, enormous data centers, and actually reducing the energy they use by nearly 30 percent that the cooling systems use, which is obviously huge if you multiply that by all of the data centers and computers they have there. So there are actually a lot of things under the hood where AI is being used to improve the efficiency of those systems all the time. But you\\u2019re right, the current products are not the end state; they\\u2019re actually just waypoints. And in the case of chatbots and those kinds of systems, ultimately, they will become these incredible universal personal assistants that you use multiple times during the day for really useful and helpful things across your daily lives.\\n\\n\\u201c...today\\u2019s chatbots will look trivial by comparison to I think what\\u2019s coming in the next few years.\\u201d\\n\\nFrom what books to read to recommendations on maybe live events and things like that to booking your travel to planning trips for you to assisting you in your everyday work. And I think we\\u2019re still far away from that with the current chatbots, and I think we know what\\u2019s missing: things like planning and reasoning and memory, and we are working really hard on those things. And I think what you\\u2019ll see in maybe a couple of years\\u2019 time is today\\u2019s chatbots will look trivial by comparison to I think what\\u2019s coming in the next few years.\\n\\nMy background is as a person who\\u2019s reported on computers. I think of computers as somewhat modular systems. You look at a phone \\u2014 it\\u2019s got a screen, it\\u2019s got a chip, it\\u2019s got a cell antenna, whatever. Should I look at AI systems that way \\u2014 there\\u2019s an LLM, which is a very convincing human language interface, and behind it might be AlphaFold that\\u2019s actually doing the protein folding? Is that how you\\u2019re thinking about stitching these things together, or is it a different evolutionary pathway?\\n\\nActually, there\\u2019s a whole branch of research going into what\\u2019s called tool use. This is the idea that these large language models or large multimodal models, they\\u2019re expert at language, of course, and maybe a few other capabilities, like math and possibly coding. But when you ask them to do something specialized, like fold a protein or play a game of chess or something like this, then actually what they end up doing is calling a tool, which could be another AI system, that then provides the solution or the answer to that particular problem. And then that\\u2019s transmitted back to the user via language or pictorially through the central large language model system. So it may be actually invisible to the user because, to the user, it just looks like one big AI system that has many capabilities, but under the hood, it could be that actually the AI system is broken down into smaller ones that have specializations.\\n\\nAnd I actually think that probably is going to be the next era. The next generation of systems will use those kinds of capabilities. And then you can think of the central system as almost a switch statement that you effectively prompt with language, and it roots your query or your question or whatever it is you\\u2019re asking it to the right tool to solve that question for you or provide the solution for you. And then transmit that back in a very understandable way. Again, using through the interface, the best interface really, of natural language.\\n\\nDoes that process get you closer to an AGI, or does that get you to some maximum state and you got to do something else?\\n\\nI think that is on the critical path to AGI, and that\\u2019s another reason, by the way, I\\u2019m very excited about this new role and actually doing more products and things because I actually think the product roadmap from here and the research roadmap from here toward something like AGI or human-level AI is very complementary. The kinds of capabilities one would need to push in order to build those kinds of products that are useful in your everyday life like a universal assistant requires pushing on some of these capabilities, like planning and memory and reasoning, that I think are vital for us to get to AGI. So I actually think there\\u2019s a really neat feedback loop now between products and research where they can effectively help each other.\\n\\nI feel like I had a lot of car CEOs on the show at the beginning of it. I asked all of them, \\u201cWhen do you think we\\u2019re going to get self-driving cars?\\u201d And they all said five years, and they\\u2019ve been saying five years for five years, right?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nI\\u2019m going to ask you a version of that question about AGI, but I feel like the number has gotten smaller recently with people I\\u2019ve talked to. How many years until you think we have AGI?\\n\\nI think there\\u2019s a lot of uncertainty over how many more breakthroughs are required to get to AGI, big, big breakthroughs \\u2014 innovative breakthroughs \\u2014 versus just scaling up existing solutions. And I think it very much depends on that in terms of timeframe. Obviously, if there are a lot of breakthroughs still required, those are a lot harder to do and take a lot longer. But right now, I would not be surprised if we approached something like AGI or AGI-like in the next decade.\\n\\nIn the next decade. All right, I\\u2019m going to come back to you in 10 years. We\\u2019re going to see if that happens.\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s not a straight line, though. You called it the critical path, that\\u2019s not a straight line. There are breakthroughs along the way that might upset the train and send you along a different path, you think.\\n\\n\\u201c...research is never a straight line. If it is, then it\\u2019s not real research.\\u201d\\n\\nResearch is never a straight line. If it is, then it\\u2019s not real research. If you knew the answer before you started it, then that\\u2019s not research. So research and blue sky research at the frontier always has uncertainty around it, and that\\u2019s why you can\\u2019t really predict timelines with any certainty. But what you can look at is trends, and we can look at the quality of ideas and projects that are being worked on today, look at how they\\u2019re progressing. And I think that could go either way over the next five to 10 years where we might asymptote, we might hit a brick wall with current techniques and scaling. I wouldn\\u2019t be surprised if that happened, either: that we may find that just scaling the existing systems resulted in diminishing returns in terms of the performance of the system.\\n\\nAnd actually, that would then signal some new innovations were really required to make further progress. At the moment, I think nobody knows which regime we\\u2019re in. So the answer to that is you have to push on both as hard as possible. So both the scaling and the engineering of existing systems and existing ideas as well as investing heavily into exploratory research directions that you think might deliver innovations that might solve some of the weaknesses in the current systems. And that\\u2019s one advantage of being a large research organization with a lot of resources is we can bet on both of those things maximally, both of those directions. In a way, I\\u2019m agnostic to that question of \\u201cdo we need more breakthroughs or will existing systems just scale all the way?\\u201d My view is it\\u2019s an empirical question, and one should push both as hard as possible. And then the results will speak for themselves.\\n\\nThis is a real tension. When you were at DeepMind in Alphabet and you were very research-focused, and then the research was moved back into Google and Google\\u2019s engineers would turn it into products. And you can see how that relationship worked. Now, you\\u2019re inside of Google. Google is under a lot of pressure as a company to win this battle. And those are product concerns. Those are \\u201cMake it real for people and go win in the market.\\u201d There\\u2019s a leaked memo that went around. It was purportedly from inside Google. It said the company had no moat and open-source AI models or leaked models would run on people\\u2019s laptops, and they would outpace the company because the history of open computing would outpace a closed-source competitor. Was that memo real?\\n\\n\\u201cI think that memo was real.\\u201d\\n\\nI think that memo was real. I think engineers at Google often write various documents, and sometimes they get leaked and go viral. I think that\\u2019s just a thing that happens, but I wouldn\\u2019t take it too seriously. These are just opinions. I think it\\u2019s interesting to listen to them, and then you\\u2019ve got to chart your own course. And I haven\\u2019t read that specific memo in detail, but I disagree with the conclusions from that. And I think there\\u2019s obviously open source and publishing, and we\\u2019ve done tons of that in the history of DeepMind. I mean, AlphaFold was open sourced, right? So we obviously believe in open source and supporting research and open research. That\\u2019s a key thing of the scientific discourse, which we\\u2019ve been a huge part of. And so is Google, of course, publishing transformers and other things. And TensorFlow and you look at all the things we\\u2019ve done.\\n\\nWe do a huge amount in that space. But I also think there are other considerations that need to be had as well. Obviously commercial ones but also safety questions about access to these very powerful systems. What if bad actors can access it? Who maybe aren\\u2019t that technical, so they couldn\\u2019t have built it themselves, but they can certainly reconfigure a system that is out there? What do you do about those things? And I think that\\u2019s been quite theoretical till now, but I think that that is really important from here all the way to AGI as these systems become more general, more sophisticated, more powerful. That question is going to be very important about how does one stop bad actors just using these systems for things they weren\\u2019t intended for but for malicious purposes.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s something we need to increasingly come up with, but just back to your question, look at the history of what Google and DeepMind have done in terms of coming up with new innovations and breakthroughs and multiple, multiple breakthroughs over the last decade or more. And I would bet on us, and I\\u2019m certainly very confident that that will continue and actually be even more true over the next decade in terms of us producing the next key breakthroughs just like we did in the past.\\n\\nDo you think that\\u2019s the moat: we invented most of this stuff, so we\\u2019re going to invent most of the next stuff?\\n\\nI don\\u2019t really think about it as moats, but I\\u2019m an incredibly competitive person. That\\u2019s maybe another thing I got from chess, and many researchers are. Of course, they\\u2019re doing it to discover knowledge, and ultimately, that\\u2019s what we are here for is to improve the human condition. But also, we want to be first to do these things and do them responsibly and boldly. We have some of the world\\u2019s best researchers. I think we have the biggest collection of great researchers in the world, anywhere in the world, and an incredible track record. And there\\u2019s no reason why that shouldn\\u2019t continue in the future. And in fact, I think with our new organization and environment might be conducive to even more and faster-paced breakthroughs than we\\u2019ve done in the past.\\n\\nYou\\u2019re leading me toward risk and regulation. I want to talk about that, but I want to start in with just a different spin on it. You\\u2019re talking about all the work that has to be done. You\\u2019re talking about deep mind reinforcement learning, how that works. We ran a gigantic cover story in collaboration with New York Magazine about the taskers who are actually doing the training, who are actually labeling the data. There\\u2019s a lot of labor conversation with AI along the way. Hollywood writers are on strike right now because they don\\u2019t want ChatGPT to write a bunch of scripts. I think that\\u2019s appropriate.\\n\\nBut then there\\u2019s a new class of labor that\\u2019s being developed where a bunch of people around the world are sitting in front of computers and saying, \\u201cYep, that\\u2019s a stop sign. No, that\\u2019s not a stop sign. Yep, that\\u2019s clothes you can wear. No, that\\u2019s not clothes you can wear.\\u201d Is that a forever state? Is that just a new class of work that needs to be done for these systems to operate? Or does that come to an end?\\n\\nI think it\\u2019s hard to say. I think it\\u2019s definitely a moment in time and the current systems and what they\\u2019re requiring at the moment. We\\u2019ve been very careful just to say, from our part, and I think you quoted some of our researchers in that article, to be very careful to pay living wages and be very responsible about how we do that kind of work and which partners we use. And we also use internal teams as well. So actually, I\\u2019m very proud of how responsible we\\u2019ve been on that type of work. But going forward, I think there may be ways that these systems, especially once you have millions and millions of users, effectively can bootstrap themselves. Or one could imagine AI systems that are capable of actually conversing with themselves or critiquing themselves.\\n\\nThis would be a bit like turning language systems into a game-like setting, which of course we\\u2019re very expert in and we\\u2019ve been thinking about where these reinforcement learning systems, different versions of them, can actually rate each other in some way. And it may not be as good as a human rater, but it\\u2019s actually a useful way to do some of the bread and butter rating and then maybe just calibrate it by checking those ratings with a human rater at the end, rather than getting human raters to rate everything. So I think there are lots of innovations I can see coming down the line that will help with this and potentially mean that there\\u2019s less requirement for this all to be done by human raters.\\n\\nBut you think there are always human raters in the mix? Even as you get closer to AGI, it seems like you need someone to tell the computer if it\\u2019s doing a good job or not.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s take AlphaZero as an example, our general games playing system that ended up learning, itself, how to play any two-player game, including chess and Go. And it\\u2019s interesting. What happened there is we set up the system so that it could play against itself tens of millions of times. So, in fact, it built up its own knowledge base. It started from random, played itself, bootstrapped itself, trained better versions of itself, and played those off each other in sort of mini-tournaments. But at the end, you still want to test it against the human world champion or something like this or an external computer program that was built in a conventional way so that you can just calibrate your own metrics, which are telling you these systems are improving according to these objectives or these metrics.\\n\\nBut you don\\u2019t know for sure until you calibrate it with an external benchmark or measure. And depending on what that is, a human rater or human benchmark \\u2014 a human expert is often the best thing to calibrate your internal testing against. And you make sure that your internal tests are actually mapping reality. And again, that\\u2019s something quite exciting about products for researchers because, when you put your research into products and millions of people are using it every day, that\\u2019s when you get real-world feedback, and there\\u2019s no way around that, right? That\\u2019s the reality, and that\\u2019s the best test of any theories or any system that you\\u2019ve built.\\n\\nDo you think that work is rewarding or appropriate, the labeling of data for AI systems? There\\u2019s just something about that, which is, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to tell a computer how to understand the world so that it might go off in the future and displace other people.\\u201d There\\u2019s a loop in there that seems like it\\u2019s worth more just moral or philosophical consideration. Have you spent time thinking about that?\\n\\nYeah, I do think about that. I think I don\\u2019t really see it like that. I think that what raters are doing is they\\u2019re part of the development cycle of making these systems safer, more useful for everybody, and more helpful and more reliable. So I think it\\u2019s a critical component. In many industries, we have safety testing of technologies and products. Today, that\\u2019s the best we can do for AI systems is to have human raters. I think, in the future, the next few years, I think we need a lot more research. And I\\u2019ve been calling for this, and we are doing this ourselves, but it needs more than just one organization to do this, is great, robust evaluation benchmarks for capabilities so that we know if a system passes these benchmarks, then it has certain properties, and it\\u2019s safe and it\\u2019s reliable in these particular ways.\\n\\nAnd right now, I think we are in the space of many researchers in academia and civil society and elsewhere, we have a lot of good suggestions for what those tests could be, but I don\\u2019t think they are robust or practical yet. I think they\\u2019re basically theoretical and philosophical in nature, and I think they need to be made practical so that we can measure our systems empirically against those tests and then that gives us some assurances about how the system will perform. And I think once we have those, then the need for this human rating testing feedback will be reduced. I just think that\\u2019s required in the volumes that\\u2019s required now because we don\\u2019t have these kinds of independent benchmarks yet. Partly because we haven\\u2019t rigorously defined what those properties are. I mean, it\\u2019s almost a neuroscience and psychology and philosophy area as well, right? A lot of these terms have not been defined properly, even for the human brain.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ve signed a letter from the Center for AI Safety \\u2014 OpenAI\\u2019s Sam Altman and others have also signed this letter \\u2014 that warns against the risk from AI. And yet, you\\u2019re pushing on, Google\\u2019s in the market, you\\u2019ve got to win, you\\u2019ve described yourself as competitive. There\\u2019s a tension there: needing to win in the market with products and \\u201cOh boy, please regulate us because raw capitalism will drive us off the cliff with AI if we don\\u2019t stop it in some way.\\u201d How do you balance that risk?\\n\\nIt is a tension. It\\u2019s a creative tension. What we like to say at Google is we want to be bold and responsible, and that\\u2019s exactly what we\\u2019re trying to do and live out and role model. So the bold part is being brave and optimistic about the benefits, the amazing benefits, incredible benefits, AI can bring to the world and to help humanity with our biggest challenges, whether that\\u2019s disease or climate or sustainability. AI has a huge part to play in helping our scientists and medical experts solve those problems. And we\\u2019re working hard on that and all those areas. And AlphaFold, again, I\\u2019d point to as a poster child for that, what we want to do there. So that\\u2019s the bold part. And then, the responsible bit is to make sure we do that as thoughtfully as possible with as much foresight as possible ahead of time.\\n\\nTry and anticipate what the issues might be if one was successful ahead of time. Not in hindsight, and perhaps this happened with social media, for example, where it is this incredible growth story. Obviously, it\\u2019s done a lot of good in the world, but then it turns out 15 years later we realize there are some unintended consequences as well to those types of systems. And I would like to chart a different path with AI. And I think it\\u2019s such a profound and important and powerful technology. I think we have to do that with something as potentially as transformative as AI. And it doesn\\u2019t mean no mistakes will be made. It\\u2019s very new, anything new, you can\\u2019t predict everything ahead of time, but I think we can try and do the best job we can.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s very new. You can\\u2019t predict everything ahead of time, but I think we can try and do the best job we can.\\u201d\\n\\nAnd that\\u2019s what signing that letter was for was just to point out that I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s likely, I don\\u2019t know on the timescales, but it\\u2019s something that we should consider, too, in the limit is what these systems can do and might be able to do as we get closer to AGI. We are nowhere near that now. So this is not a question of today\\u2019s technologies or even the next few years\\u2019, but at some point, and given the technology\\u2019s accelerating very fast, we will need to think about those questions, and we don\\u2019t want to be thinking about them on the eve of them happening. We need to use the time now, the next five, 10, whatever it is, years, to do the research and to do the analysis and to engage with various stakeholders, civil society, academia, government, to figure out, as this stuff is developing very rapidly, what the best way is of making sure we maximize the benefits and minimize any risks.\\n\\nAnd that includes mostly, at this stage, doing more research into these areas, like coming up with better evaluations and benchmarks to rigorously test the capabilities of these frontier systems.\\n\\nYou talked about tool usage for AI models, you ask an LLM to do something, it goes off and asks AlphaFold to fold the protein for you. Combining systems like that, integrating systems like that, historically that\\u2019s where emergent behaviors appear, things you couldn\\u2019t have predicted start happening. Are you worried about that? There\\u2019s not a rigorous way to test that.\\n\\nRight, exactly. I think that\\u2019s exactly the sort of thing we should be researching and thinking about ahead of time is: as tool use becomes more sophisticated and you can combine different AI systems together in different ways, there is scope for emergent behavior. Of course, that emergent behavior may be very desirable and be extremely useful, but it could also potentially be harmful in the wrong hands and in the hands of bad actors, whether that\\u2019s individuals or even nation-states.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s say the United States and the EU and China all agree on some framework to regulate AI, and then North Korea or Iran says, \\u201cFuck it, no rules.\\u201d And that becomes a center of bad actor AI research. How does that play out? Do you foresee a world in which that\\u2019s possible?\\n\\nYeah, I think that is a possible world. This is why I\\u2019ve been talking to governments \\u2014 UK, US mostly, but also EU \\u2014 on I think whatever regulations or guardrails or whatever that is that transpires over the next few years, and tests. They ideally would be international, and there would be international cooperation around those safeguards and international agreement around deployment of these systems and other things. Now, I don\\u2019t know how likely that is given the geopolitical tensions around the world, but that is by far the best state. And I think what we should be aiming for if we can.\\n\\nIf the government here passes a rule. It says, \\u201cHere\\u2019s what Google is allowed to do, here\\u2019s what Microsoft is allowed to do. You are in charge, you are accountable.\\u201d And you can go say, \\u201cAll right, we\\u2019re just not running this code in our data center. We are not going to have these capabilities; it\\u2019s not legal.\\u201d If I\\u2019m just a person with a MacBook, would you accept some limitation on what a MacBook could do because the threat from AI is so scary? That\\u2019s the thing I worry about. Practically, if you have open-source models and people are going to use them for weird things, are we going to tell Intel to restrict what its chips can do? How would we implement that such that it actually affects everyone? And not just, we\\u2019re going to throw Demis in jail if Google does stuff we don\\u2019t like.\\n\\nI think those are the big questions that are being debated right now. And I do worry about that. On the one hand, there are a lot of benefits of open-sourcing and accelerating scientific discourse and lots of advances happen there and it gives access to many developers. On the other hand, there could be some negative consequences with that if there are bad individual actors that do bad things with that access and that proliferates. And I think that\\u2019s a question for the next few years that will need to be resolved. Because right now, I think it\\u2019s okay because the systems are not that sophisticated or that powerful and therefore not that risky.\\n\\nBut I think, as systems increase in their power and generality, the access question will need to be thought about from government and how they want to restrict that or control that or monitor that is going to be an important question. I don\\u2019t have any answers for you because I think this is a societal question actually that requires stakeholders from right across society to come together and weigh up the benefits with the risks there.\\n\\nGoogle\\u2019s own work, you said we\\u2019re not there yet, but Google\\u2019s own work in AI certainly had some controversy associated with this around responsibility, around what the models can do or can\\u2019t do. There\\u2019s a famous \\u201cStochastic Parrots\\u201d paper from Emily Bender and Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell that led to a lot of controversy inside of Google. It led to them leaving. Did you read that paper and think, \\u201cOkay, this is correct. LLMs are going to lie to people and Google will be responsible for that\\u201d? And how do you think about that now with all of the scrutiny?\\n\\nYeah, look, the large language models, and I think this is one reason that Google\\u2019s been very responsible with this, is that we know that they hallucinate and they can be inaccurate. And that\\u2019s one of the key areas that has to be improved over the next few years is factuality and grounding and making sure that they don\\u2019t spread disinformation, these kinds of things. And that\\u2019s very much top of mind for us. And we have many ideas of how to improve that. And our old DeepMind\\u2019s Sparrow language model, which we published a couple of years ago, was an experiment into just how good can we get factuality and rules adherence in these systems. And turns out, we can maybe make it an order of magnitude better, but it sometimes comes at the expense of lucidness or creativity on the part of the language model and therefore usefulness.\\n\\nSo it\\u2019s a bit of a Pareto frontier where, if you improve one dimension, you reduce the capability in another dimension. And ideally, what we want to do in the next phases and the next generations of systems is combine the best of both worlds \\u2014 keep the creativity and lucidness and funness of the current systems but improve their factuality and reliability. And we\\u2019ve got a long way to go on that. But I can see things improving, and I don\\u2019t see any theoretical reason why these systems can\\u2019t get to extremely high levels of accuracy and reliability in the next few years.\\n\\nWhen you\\u2019re using the Google Search Generative Experience, do you believe what it says?\\n\\nI do. I sometimes double-check things, especially in the scientific domain where I\\u2019ve had very funny situations where, actually all of these models do this, where you ask them to summarize an area of research, which I think would be super useful if they could do that, and then say, \\u201cWell, what are the key papers I should read?\\u201d And they come up with very plausible sounding papers with very plausible author lists. But then, when you go and look into it, it turns out that they\\u2019re just like the most famous people in that field or the titles from two different papers combined together. But of course, they\\u2019re extremely plausible as a collection of words. And I think, there what needs to happen is these systems need to understand that citations and papers and author lists are a unitary block rather than a word-by-word prediction.\\n\\nThere are interesting cases like that where we need to improve, and there\\u2019s something which is, of course, us as wanting to advance the frontiers of science, that\\u2019s a particularly interesting use case that we would like to improve and fix \\u2014 for our own needs as well. I\\u2019d love these systems to better summarize for me \\u201chere are the top five papers to read about a particular disease\\u201d or something like that to just quickly onboard you in that particular area. I think it would be incredibly useful.\\n\\nI\\u2019ll tell you, I googled my friend John Gruber, and SGE confidently told me that he pioneered the use of a Mac in newspapers and invented WebKit. I don\\u2019t know where that came from. Is there a quality level, a truthfulness level that you need to hit before you roll that out to the mass audience?\\n\\nYeah, we think about this all the time, especially at Google because of the incredibly high standards Google holds itself to on things like search and that we all rely on every day and every moment of every day, really, and we want to get toward that level of reliability. Obviously, we\\u2019re a long, long, long way away from that at the moment with not just us but anybody with their generative systems. But that\\u2019s the gold standard. And actually, things like tool use can come in very handy here where you could, in effect, build these systems so that they fact-check themselves, perhaps even using search or other reliable sources, cross-reference, just like a good researcher would, cross-reference your facts. Also having a better understanding of the world. What are research papers? What entities are they?\\n\\nSo these systems need to have a better understanding of the media they\\u2019re dealing with. And maybe also give these systems the ability to reason and plan because then they could potentially turn that on their own outputs and critique themselves. And again, this is something we have a lot of experience in in games programs. They don\\u2019t just output the first move that you think of in chess or Go. You actually plan and do some search around that and then back up. And sometimes they change their minds and switch to a better move. And you could imagine some process like that with words and language as well.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s the concept of model collapse. That we\\u2019re going to train LLMs on LLM-generated data, and that\\u2019s going to go into a circle. When you talk about cross-referencing facts, and I think about Google \\u2014 Google going out in the web and trying to cross-reference a bunch of stuff but maybe all that stuff has been generated by LLMs that were hallucinating in 2023. How do you guard against that?\\n\\nWe are working on some pretty cool solutions to that. I think the answer is, and this is an answer to deepfakes as well, is to do some encrypted watermarking, sophisticated watermarking, that can\\u2019t be removed easily or at all, and it\\u2019s probably built into the generative models themselves, so it\\u2019s part of the generative process. We hope to release that and maybe provide it to third parties as well as a generic solution. But I think that the industry in the field needs those types of solutions where we can mark generated media, be that images, audio, perhaps even text with some Kitemark that says to the user and future AI systems that these were AI-generated. And I think that\\u2019s a very, very pressing need right now for near-term issues with AI like deepfakes and disinformation and so on. But I actually think a solution is on the horizon now.\\n\\nI had Microsoft CTO and EVP of AI Kevin Scott on the show a few weeks ago. He said something very similar.

A few ways include watermarking, metadata, and other tools to let users know where something, such as an image, originates.\\n\\nThese companies are also tasked with researching the risks to society AI systems pose, such as \\\"harmful bias, discrimination, and protecting privacy.\\\"\\n\\n(Image credit: Android Central)\\n\\nNext, companies must continuously report about their AI systems publically so everyone, including the government and others in the industry, can understand where they're at on a security and societal risk factor level. Developing AI to help solve healthcare issues and environmental changes is included on the commitment list.\\n\\nSecurity is another hot topic, and as the White House's fact sheet states, all seven companies are to invest in cybersecurity measures and \\\"insider threat protocols\\\" to protect proprietary and unreleased model weights. The latter has been deemed to be the most important when going about developing the right security protocols for AI systems.\\n\\nCompanies are also required to facilitate third-party discovery and report any vulnerabilities within their systems.\\n\\n(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)\\n\\nAll of this must be done before companies can roll out new AI systems to the public, the White House states. The seven companies need to conduct internal and external security tests of their AI systems before release. Additionally, information needs to be shared across the industry, the government, civil society, and academia about best practices for safety and other such threats to their systems.\\n\\nSafety and comfort with artificial intelligence are required as companies such as Google have warned their employees to exercise caution when using AI chatbots over security concerns. That's not the first instance of such fear as Samsung had quite the scare when an engineer accidentally submitted confidential company code to an AI chatbot.\\n\\nLastly, Google voluntarily committing to advancing safe AI practices along with several others comes two months after it joined with the EU for a similar agreement. The company collaborated to create the \\\"AI Pact,\\\" a new set of guidelines companies in the region were urged to voluntarily agree to get a handle on AI software before it goes too far.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Android Central\", \"author\": \"tips@androidcentral.com (Vishnu Sarangapurkar)\", \"title\": \"ChatGPT for Android is going live next week as Google Play Store listing appears\", \"description\": \"The standalone ChatGPT app debuted on iOS in May and is coming to Android next week.\", \"url\": \"https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-app-going-live-for-android-next-week\", \"text\": \"What you need to know\\n\\nAndroid owners can start installing ChatGPT on their devices beginning next week.\\n\\nWith over half a million installs on iOS, the ability to get installed on Android will likely boost the number.\\n\\nThe primary features during rollout include Instant answers, Tailored advice, Creative Inspiration, and more.\\n\\nAfter debuting to iOS in May, the standalone ChatGPT app is all set to land on Android devices next week, OpenAI announced.

A similar approach was taken with social media platforms, she said, and it didn\\u2019t work. \\u201cIt\\u2019s internal compliance checking and it\\u2019s similar to what we\\u2019ve seen in the FTC consent orders from the past when they required Facebook to do internal privacy impact assessments and they just became a box-checking exercise.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has said he will introduce legislation to regulate AI. He has held a number of briefings with government officials to educate senators about an issue that\\u2019s attracted bipartisan interest.\\n\\nA number of technology executives have called for regulation, and several went to the White House in May to speak with Biden, vice-president Kamala Harris and other officials.\\n\\nSenator Mark Warner said the guidelines released on Friday are a start but that \\u201cwe need more than industry commitments\\u201d.\\n\\n\\u201cWhile we often hear AI vendors talk about their commitment to security and safety, we have repeatedly seen the expedited release of products that are exploitable, prone to generating unreliable outputs, and susceptible to misuse,\\u201d Warner said in a statement.\\n\\nBut some experts and upstart competitors worry that the type of regulation being floated could be a boon for deep-pocketed first-movers led by OpenAI, Google and Microsoft, as smaller players are elbowed out by the high cost of making their AI systems known as large language models adhere to regulatory strictures.\\n\\nThe software trade group BSA, which includes Microsoft as a member, said on Friday that it welcomed the Biden administration\\u2019s efforts to set rules for high-risk AI systems.\\n\\n\\u201cEnterprise software companies look forward to working with the administration and Congress to enact legislation that addresses the risks associated with artificial intelligence and promote its benefits,\\u201d the group said in a statement.\\n\\nSeveral countries have been looking at ways to regulate AI, including European Union lawmakers who have been negotiating sweeping AI rules for the 27-country bloc.\\n\\nThe details of the European legislation are still being hashed out, but the EU AI Act contains robust regulations that would create significant consumer protections against the overreach, privacy violations and biases of certain types of high-risk AI models.\\n\\nMeanwhile conversations in the US remain in the early stages. Fitzgerald, of Epic, said while the voluntary guidelines are just one in a series of guidelines the White House has released on AI, she worries it might cause Congress to slow down their push to create regulations. \\u201cWe need the rules of the road before it gets too big to regulate,\\u201d she said.\\n\\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres, recently said the United Nations was \\u201cthe ideal place\\u201d to adopt global standards and appointed a board that will report back on options for global AI governance by the end of the year.\\n\\nThe United Nations chief also said he welcomed calls from some countries for the creation of a new UN body to support global efforts to govern AI, inspired by such models as the International Atomic Energy Agency or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\n\\nThe White House said on Friday that it had already consulted on the voluntary commitments with a number of countries.\\n\\nAssociated Press contributed to this story\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Heather Stewart\", \"title\": \"\\u2018We have to flip the AI debate towards hope\\u2019: Labour\\u2019s techno-optimist, Darren Jones\", \"description\": \"The chair of the Commons business select committee is a firm believer that technology is a force for good and should be central to his party\\u2019s plans to transform the UK\\u2018It\\u2019s an upgrade.

In the same way as you upgrade your iPhone, we need to upgrade Britain.\\u201d Labour MP Darren Jones believes artificial intelligence will bring an economic change on the scale of the industrial revolution, which politicians must be ready to shape.\\n\\nAs chair of the business and trade select committee, the ambitious 36-year-old backbencher, who represents Bristol North West, has built a reputation for himself in Westminster as a tough interrogator.\\n\\nWith speculation raging last week about the future of Thames Water, he took to the airwaves to criticise the way the heavily indebted sector has been regulated, saying he was \\u201cincreasingly sick\\u201d of its failures.\\n\\nHowever, Jones is at his most animated when talking about AI. He has clashed with company bosses over their use of technology to monitor and control staff \\u2013 including at Amazon and Royal Mail. But he is an evangelist for the upsides of innovation, including the arrival of large language models (LLMs) such as the hit dialogue-based AI software ChatGPT.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s really important that we flip this debate. Lots of people will have started to hear about AI and human extinction and job losses, and they will associate it with anxiety or fear,\\u201d the MP says.\\n\\n\\u201cBut we\\u2019re not going to get widespread adoption of technology in the economy unless people want to use it. So we have to flip the debate towards hope \\u2013 hope of better pay, better work, better public services.\\u201d\\n\\nHe believes the potential productivity improvements that could be available \\u2013 if the technology is adopted in the right way \\u2013 could help drag the UK out of the economic doldrums.\\n\\nJones thinks there is a distinctive Labour approach here, which involves embracing AI while setting clear constraints on how it is adopted in order to protect workers, and making training and support available to help those affected to transition to new jobs.\\n\\n\\u201cThe state should be in there making the case: we welcome this technology, we want to adopt it \\u2013 but there are certain requirements, about the social impact, about privacy, about security, about equality, that we will guarantee as part of that process,\\u201d he says. Jones made similar points in a House of Commons debate on AI last week.\\n\\nKeir Starmer made his own view clear earlier this month, with the Labour leader warning that the country was at an \\u201cinflection point\\u201d, and if the adoption of AI was not well managed, the consequences could mirror the de-industrialisation of the 1980s.\\n\\nRishi Sunak\\u2019s government has until recently appeared to favour a laissez-faire stance, using its AI white paper to hail the benefits of the technology, but the prime minister has since highlighted some of the potential risks and will be hosting a global \\u201cAI safety\\u201d summit in the autumn.\\n\\nJones argues the catastrophic risks recently raised by some of the AI sector\\u2019s leading figures could, with political will, be relatively easily managed. Only a small number of tech giants have access to the massive computing power it needs, he says, so that \\u201cit\\u2019s quite easy in terms of oversight \\u2013 sharing of information, collaboration, maybe a bit about licensing access to these very sophisticated computers\\u201d.\\n\\nWe should not be talking about AI, we should be talking about improving the quality of education for our kids, or clearing the backlogs in the NHS \\u2013 and making the case that all of that is delivered through technology\\n\\nAs a former technology lawyer, he is critical of the AI act recently approved by the European parliament, which he believes could stifle innovation. However, he also warns against the no-holds-barred approach of the US. \\u201cI \\u2026 don\\u2019t think the European approach is in the interests of Britain, and I think we can carve out a third way,\\u201d he says.\\n\\nThat phrase, resonant of Tony Blair in his prime, may be telling. Jones was swept into Westminster in the summer of 2017, when Jeremy Corbyn wiped out Theresa May\\u2019s majority and took Glastonbury by storm, but he is no Corbynista.\\n\\nHigh on a shelf in his Westminster office is a snap of him sporting a red rosette, standing proudly outside the council flat in Lawrence Weston, Bristol, where he grew up, in the area he now represents. In his maiden speech, he pointed out that he was the first Darren ever elected to the Commons.\\n\\nJones says the policies of Blair\\u2019s 1997 Labour government transformed his life. The national minimum wage boosted the pay of both his parents \\u2013 his dad was a security guard and his mum an NHS administrator.\\n\\nHis secondary school was one of the worst-performing in the country but he took part in Labour\\u2019s Young, Gifted and Talented programme for bright kids in state schools, which helped him to get a place at Plymouth University. \\u201cI got to go to university because the government put it in front of me,\\u201d he says, bluntly.\\n\\nWhile not promising that things can only get better, as per Blair\\u2019s 1997 election anthem, he does believe a heavy dose of techno-optimism should be central to Labour\\u2019s pitch.\\n\\n\\u201cIt should be, in my view, at the heart of our plan to transform the country, and at the heart of our political vision \\u2013 but you would have to anchor it in people\\u2019s concerns and experiences,\\u201d he says.\\n\\n\\u201cWe should not be talking about AI, we should be talking about improving the quality of education for our kids, or clearing the backlogs in the NHS, or getting people better jobs \\u2013 and making the case that all of that is delivered through technology.\\u201d\\n\\nHe believes the state\\u2019s role is not to try to impose technological solutions from Whitehall, but provide what he calls \\u201ccore, central digital infrastructure\\u201d and then build an \\u201cecosystem\\u201d that encourages and rewards innovation.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we should be announcing hundred-million-quid, top-down transformation programmes of public services, because traditionally they\\u2019ve always failed,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt has to be bottom-up-led innovation.\\u201d\\n\\nAfter Sunak\\u2019s recent departmental rejig, science and technology are no longer under the aegis of Jones\\u2019s committee, formerly known as the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, which now covers business and trade. Asked if he might fancy a position on Starmer\\u2019s frontbench \\u2013 perhaps in the as-yet-unfilled role of shadow secretary of state for science and technology \\u2013 Jones says he\\u2019s not lobbying for a job.

On Thursday, the film\\u2019s cast, including Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon, left the film\\u2019s London premiere early, when the strike was called. (Damon told Deadline that the strike will affect his new production company founded with Ben Affleck.)

But the film\\u2019s original May 2024 release date now seems in jeopardy due to the production halt, a sign of the Hollywood stasis to come.\\n\\nHBO\\u2019s blockbuster series House of the Dragon, however, will continue filming in the UK due to local union rules, as first reported by Variety. The majority of the actors on the Game of Thrones prequel, currently filming its second season, are from the UK and thus under contracts governed by the UK local union, Equity. The series is technically allowed to continue filming as Equity members are not legally permitted to strike in solidarity with US actors. In strike guidance provided by Equity hours before Sag-Aftra officially declared a walkout, the union, the 12th largest trade organization in the UK, said it would \\u201csupport Sag-Aftra and its members by all lawful means\\u201d.\\n\\nA strike could also torpedo major summer and fall film festivals, which are now in wait-and-see mode. Glitzy photo opportunity-oriented festivals like Venice, which is set to begin on 30 August, could be held without major Hollywood stars.

But on Friday, the president of Actors\\u2019 Equity, which represents stage actors and stage managers, urged members to \\u201cproactively and aggressively avoid breaking\\u201d the Sag-Aftra strike by inadvertently crossing the picket line. The guild president, Kate Shindle, encouraged members to contact Sag-Aftra with any questions about potentially struck work, and added: \\u201cKnow this: the other side will try to pit us against each other to keep churning out content. Don\\u2019t fall for it.\\u201d\\n\\nAt the heart of the negotiations is what many members have referred to as an existential question over the future of AI in replacing writers or generating unapproved likenesses of actors, among other concerns. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) said it offered a \\u201cgroundbreaking AI proposal which protects performers\\u2019 digital likenesses, including a requirement for performer\\u2019s consent for the creation and use of digital replicas or for digital alterations of a performance\\u201d.

Here are some details in each of those categories.\\n\\nSafety: The companies agreed to \\\"testing the safety and capabilities of their AI systems, subjecting them to external testing, assessing their potential biological, cybersecurity, and societal risks and making the results of those assessments public.\\\"\\n\\nSecurity: The companies also said they will safeguard their AI products \\\"against cyber and insider threats\\\" and share \\\"best practices and standards to prevent misuse, reduce risks to society, and protect national security.\\\"\\n\\nTrust: One of the biggest agreements secured was for these companies to make it easy for people to tell whether images are original, altered or generated by AI. They will also ensure that AI doesn't promote discrimination or bias, they will protect children from harm, and will use AI to solve challenges like climate change and cancer.\\n\\nThe arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022 was the beginning of a stampede of major tech companies releasing generative AI tools to the masses. OpenAI's GPT-4 launched in mid-March. It's the latest version of the large language model that powers the ChatGPT AI chatbot, which among other things is advanced enough to pass the bar exam. Chatbots, however, are prone to spitting out incorrect answers and sometimes sources that don't exist. As adoption of these tools has exploded, their potential problems have gained renewed attention -- including spreading misinformation and deepening bias and inequality.\\n\\nWhat the AI companies are saying and doing\\n\\nMeta said it welcomed the White House agreement. Earlier this week, the company launched the second generation of its AI large language model, Llama 2, making it free and open source.\\n\\n\\\"As we develop new AI models, tech companies should be transparent about how their systems work and collaborate closely across industry, government, academia and civil society,\\\" said Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs.\\n\\nThe White House agreement will \\\"create a foundation to help ensure the promise of AI stays ahead of its risks,\\\" Brad Smith, Microsoft vice chair and president, said in a blog post.\\n\\nMicrosoft is a partner on Meta's Llama 2. It also launched AI-powered Bing search earlier this year that makes use of ChatGPT and is bringing more and more AI tools to Microsoft 365 and its Edge browser.\\n\\nThe agreement with the White House is part of OpenAI's \\\"ongoing collaboration with governments, civil society organizations and others around the world to advance AI governance,\\\" said Anna Makanju, OpenAI vice president of global affairs. \\\"Policymakers around the world are considering new laws for highly capable AI systems. Today's commitments contribute specific and concrete practices to that ongoing discussion.\\\"\\n\\nAmazon is in support of the voluntary commitments \\\"as one of the world's leading developers and deployers of AI tools and services,\\\" Tim Doyle, Amazon spokesperson, told CNET in an emailed statement. \\\"We are dedicated to driving innovation on behalf of our customers while also establishing and implementing the necessary safeguards to protect consumers and customers.\\\"\\n\\nAmazon has leaned into AI for its podcasts and music and on Amazon Web Services.\\n\\nAnthropic said in an emailed statement that all AI companies \\\"need to join in a race for AI safety.\\\" The company said it will announce its plans in the coming weeks on \\\"cybersecurity, red teaming and responsible scaling.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's a huge amount of safety work ahead. So far AI safety has been stuck in the space of ideas and meetings,\\\" Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder and CEO of Inflection AI, wrote in a blog post Friday. \\\"The amount of tangible progress versus hype and panic has been insufficient. At Inflection we find this both concerning and frustrating. That's why safety is at the heart of our mission.\\\"\\n\\nWhat else?\\n\\n\\\"Today is a milestone in bringing the industry together to ensure that AI helps everyone,\\\" said Kent Walker, Google's President of Global Affairs, in a blog post later Friday. \\\"These commitments will support efforts by the G7, the OECD, and national governments to maximize AI's benefits and minimize its risks.\\\"\\n\\nGoogle, which launched a chatbot called Bard in March, previously said it would watermark AI content. The company's AI model Gemini will identify text, images and footage that have been generated by AI. It will check the metadata integrated in content to let you know what's unaltered and what's been created by AI.\\n\\nImage software company Adobe is similarly ensuring it's tagging AI-generated images from its Firefly AI tools with metadata indicating they've been created by an AI system.\\n\\nYou can read the entire voluntary agreement between the companies and the White House here.\\n\\nThe Biden-Harris administration is also developing an executive order and seeking bipartisan legislation \\\"to keep Americans safe\\\" from AI. The US Office of Management and Budget is additionally slated to release guidelines for any federal agencies that are procuring or using AI systems.\\n\\nSee also: ChatGPT vs. Bing vs. Google Bard: Which AI Is the Most Helpful?\\n\\nEditors' note: CNET is using an AI engine to help create some stories.

This comes a month after another DeSantis ad featured an image of Trump hugging and kissing Anthony Fauci, the White House's former chief medical advisor, which experts told AFP was likely AI-generated.\\n\\nA study published in June found that a majority of people were unable to tell whether a tweet was written by a human or by ChatGPT. The participants surveyed even found ChatGPT-tweets more convincing than their human counterparts.\\n\\nWhen contacted for comment by Insider, several of the companies who made the agreement with the White House pointed to their recent statements on the partnership, in which many referenced upcoming collaborations that will allow them to follow through on the commitments. Meta and Inflection did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\\n\\nIn a blog post on the agreement, Google directly referenced its ongoing efforts to integrate watermarking, as well as to develop its \\\"About this image\\\" tool, which would allow users to identify where an image originated online and whether its been featured on fact-checking sites or news publications.\\n\\nInflection, the studio behind the personal AI chatbot named \\\"Pi,\\\" said in a blog post about the agreement that \\\"the project of making truly safe and trustworthy AI is still only in its earliest phase.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We see this as simply a springboard and catalyst for doing more,\\\" Inflection added.\\n\\nThe growing anxiety around how to spot fake content has incentivized many AI startups to develop tools that vet whether a piece of content was produced by a human or AI.

To address these issues, the White House has convened seven of the most prominent AI developers to discuss common goals of safety and openness. The voluntary pledges made by these businesses are nonetheless seen as a positive development towards the establishment of regulations and guidelines for the AI industry.\\n\\nRepresentatives from the following artificial intelligence companies were present at the White House meeting:\\n\\nBrad Smith, President of Microsoft; Kent Walker, President, Google; Dario Amodei, CEO, Anthropic; Mustafa Suleyman, CEO, Inflection AI; Nick Clegg, President, Meta; Greg Brockman, President, OpenAI; Adam Selipsky, CEO, Amazon Web Services;\\n\\nAlthough the AI companies\\u2019 pledges are not legally binding, they do show a desire to address the issues that have been raised about AI. The major promises made by the businesses are as follows:\\n\\nBefore releasing their AI systems to the public, the companies have committed to conducting internal and external security tests. Experts from outside the company can act as an adversarial \\u201cred team\\u201d to probe for security flaws and threats. Companies using AI have promised to inform policymakers, academics, and members of civil society about the dangers posed by AI and the methods being developed to counteract them. Concerns like preventing unauthorized access or \\u201cjailbreaking\\u201d of AI systems are among those they hope to address by encouraging collaboration and transparency. The companies will invest in cybersecurity measures, including protections against insider threats, to ensure the privacy of client model data and intellectual property. This is essential to thwart hackers\\u2019 attempts to exploit security flaws and steal private data. Through bug bounty programs and/or domain expert analysis, the companies will encourage third-party discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities. This promotes outside inspection, which is useful for discovering vulnerabilities in AI systems. Companies are working on developing reliable watermarking or other methods of marking AI-generated content to ensure accountability and traceability. This is crucial in the fight against disinformation and deepfakes, as it will allow for the identification of the original creator and authenticity of AI-generated content. Companies have pledged to disclose their AI systems\\u2019 strengths and weaknesses as well as the contexts in which they should and should not be used. This openness is crucial for preventing misuse of AI and ensuring its responsible deployment. The companies will put a premium on studying the social risks of AI, such as discrimination and invasion of privacy. By identifying and mitigating these threats, they hope to create AI systems that are equitable, apolitical, and protective of individual privacy. The companies will also work on creating and deploying AI to tackle some of society\\u2019s biggest problems, like stopping cancer and fixing the climate. The lack of monitoring of AI models\\u2019 carbon footprint, however, calls attention to the need for more eco-friendly considerations in AI research and development.\\n\\nThe AI companies\\u2019 pledges are entirely voluntary, but the Biden administration is working on an AI-related Executive Order. In its current form, this order has the potential to promote compliance and set industry standards. The Executive Order could instruct government agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate AI products claiming robust security, for instance, if companies do not permit external security testing of their AI models prior to release.\\n\\nThe administration\\u2019s forward-thinking stance on AI reflects its commitment to avoiding technological pitfalls in the future. Because of the lessons it has learned from social media\\u2019s disruptive potential, the government is eager to launch a comprehensive plan for artificial intelligence. Vice President Harris and President Biden have already consulted with business moguls and other influential figures. There has also been a substantial investment in AI research institutions and initiatives.\\n\\nThe national science and research infrastructure, however, has been ahead of the government in this respect. There is already a comprehensive report outlining the difficulties and potential benefits of AI for science that was compiled by the Department of Energy (DOE) and National Labs.\\n\\nFinally, the major AI companies\\u2019 voluntary commitments made at the White House are a big deal for ensuring safety and transparency in the AI industry. Although the pledges are not legally binding, they do show a commitment to working together, sharing data, and putting an emphasis on ethical AI research and development. There needs to be a middle ground between being innovative and making sure AI is used in a responsible and ethical way.\\n\\nFirst reported on TechCrunch\\n\\nFrequently Asked Question\\n\\nQ.

Here's a look at each team's notable picks this week, and how\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10081144-2023-nhl-draft-results-team-by-team-grades-for-notable-picks\", \"text\": \"Bruce Bennett/Getty Images\\n\\nThe 2023 NHL Draft, which took place June 28-29, had a few surprises in store for hockey fans.\\n\\nHere's a look at each team's notable picks this week, and how we rank them.\\n\\n2023 NHL Draft Notable Picks and Grades\\n\\nAnaheim Ducks: A\\n\\nLeo Carlsson (C), Round 1, Pick 2; Damian Clara (G), Round 2, Pick 28\\n\\nThe Ducks raised some eyebrows by passing over Michigan Hobey Baker winner Adam Fantilli at No. 2, but Carlsson spent last season matching up against adults in the Swedish Hockey League, potentially making him a surer bet with regard to immediate NHL readiness.\\n\\nAnaheim also grabbed 6-foot-6 Italian Damian Clara, an intriguing prospect on his size alone.\\n\\nArizona Coyotes: C\\n\\nDmitry Simashev (D), Round 1, Pick 6; Danil But (L), Round 1, Pick 12\\n\\nBoth Simashev and But are under contract in the KHL through 2024-25. As they likely won't be ready to join the NHL immediately, why not wait instead for KHL phenom Matvei Michkov, who is signed in Russia through 2026? Michkov was still on the board at No. 6.\\n\\nBoston Bruins: B-\\n\\nChristopher Pelosi (C), Round 3, Pick 28\\n\\nThe Bruins took Pelosi at 92nd overall, 35 spots ahead of his pre-draft ranking, so Boston scouts saw something in this 6-foot-1 center they liked in the NAHL and USHL last season. Pelosi will play in the NCAA next season with Quinnipiac, and his performance could show how much of a shot he's going to have in the NHL.\\n\\nBuffalo Sabres: B+\\n\\nZach Benson (L), Round 1, Pick 13\\n\\nThe Sabres' front office has been tracking Benson for two seasons, per NHL.com's Jourdon LaBarber. He played with Matthew Savoie, the Sabres' No. 9 pick of 2022, in the WHL last season. Buffalo might plan to see Benson and Savoie in the NHL together someday.\\n\\nCalgary Flames: B\\n\\nSamuel Honzek (L), Round 1, Pick 16\\n\\nHonzek is 18 years old but already measures in at 6-foot-4 and 194 pounds, giving the Flames reason to hope his success at the WHL level could translate to the NHL. Calgary chose to stick with a sizeable center over some of the higher-scoring wingers still available because the team considered Honzek the best player available overall at No. 16, per The Athletic's Julian McKenzie.\\n\\nCarolina Hurricanes: B+\\n\\nBradley Nadeau (L), Round 1, Pick 30\\n\\nNadeau was named the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL)'s MVP last season after leading all skaters with 68 assists and 113 points in 54 games. He could fit in with a team built around skilled scorers.\\n\\nChicago Blackhawks: A+\\n\\nConnor Bedard (C), Round 1, Pick 1; Oliver Moore (C), Round 1, Pick 19\\n\\nThe Hawks added potentially generational scoring talent to a team starved for offense with Bedard. The Hawks also originally wanted to trade up for Moore, who established himself as one of the draft's best skaters with the U.S. National Team Development Program last season, so Chicago likely considers him a steal at No. 19.\\n\\nColorado Avalanche: A-\\n\\nCalum Ritchie (C), Round 1, Pick 27\\n\\nRitchie played last season with an injured shoulder, which was part of the reason he dropped to the bottom of the first round. Had he been healthy he likely would have gone much higher and could end up as a steal with NHL potential for the Avs.\\n\\nColumbus Blue Jackets: A\\n\\nAdam Fantilli (C), Round 1, Pick 3\\n\\nThe Blue Jackets got to snag one of the draft's most talented scorers when Fantilli was passed over by the Anaheim Ducks at No. 2. For a team struggling despite having Johnny Gaudreau at wing, the addition of a player projected to be a top-line center will be key to a bounce-back season.\\n\\nDallas Stars: C\\n\\nTristan Bertucci (D), Round 2, Pick 29\\n\\nThe Stars saw 60 picks go by before they got to have a say, so it was a relatively weak draft class for the Stars. Bertucci will still be a prospect to watch. He has developed into a strong skater and a two-way defenseman over the last OHL season.\\n\\nDetroit Red Wings: A-\\n\\nNate Danielson (C), Round 1, Pick 9; Axel Sandin Pellikka (D), Round 1, Pick 17; Trey Augustine (G), Round 2, Pick 9\\n\\nThe Red Wings need a center, defense and goaltending. They got viable prospects in all three areas with their first three picks.\\n\\nEdmonton Oilers: C\\n\\nBeau Akey (D), Round 2, Pick 24; Nathaniel Day (G), Round 6, Pick 24\\n\\nAkey saw his OHL ice time drop toward the end of last season, while Day put up a 3.91 GAA and .874 SV% in 32 games behind a fifth-place OHL team. Their NHL potential remains to be seen.\\n\\nFlorida Panthers: B+\\n\\nGracyn Sawchyn (C), Round 2, Pick 31\\n\\nScouts like to describe Sawchyn as \\\"gritty\\\" and says he's a fan of Matthew Tkachuk, so he sounds like the exact kind of player Florida wants in their system.\\n\\nLos Angeles Kings: C\\n\\nJakub Dvorak (D), Round 2, Pick 22\\n\\nDvorak is a 6-foot-5 defenseman and a lefty, which the Kings need on their blueline, but he suffered multiple injuries last season and is under contract in the Czech Republic for another year.\\n\\nMinnesota Wild: B+\\n\\nCharlie Stramel (C), Round 1, Pick 21\\n\\nThe Wild need depth down the middle. Stramel, who proved himself to be a viable two-way center at the University of Wisconsin last season, could be that center.\\n\\nMontreal Canadiens: B-\\n\\nDavid Reinbacher (D), Round 1, Pick 5; Jacob Fowler (G), Round 3, Pick 5\\n\\nThe Habs wanted a defender, and they passed on Michkov to get him. Can this team, which needs a dynamic scorer, afford that? Boston College goalie Fowler, meanwhile, adds depth to Montreal's net.\\n\\nNashville Predators: B+\\n\\nMatthew Wood (R), Round 1, Pick 15; Tanner Molendyk (D), Round 1, Pick 24\\n\\nNashville got goalscoring potential in Wood and a quick-skating center in Molendyk. Both are likely to earn shots at the NHL as the Predators begin a rebuild.\\n\\nNew Jersey Devils: B-\\n\\nLenni Hameenaho (R), Round 2, Pick 26\\n\\nHameenaho skated last season with adults in the Finnish pro league and saw his ice time progress throughout the year, but says he will need \\\"a few more years\\\" before he's NHL-ready.\\n\\nNew York Islanders: B+\\n\\nDanny Nelson (C), Round 2, Pick 17\\n\\nNelson played as a defenseman before transitioning to center, giving him a rare skill range that makes him an intriguing pick.\\n\\nNew York Rangers: A\\n\\nGabriel Perreault (R), Round 1, Pick 23\\n\\nPerreault was projected by some to go in the top 10 of the draft and has the potential to end up as a top-six winger after a record-breaking season with the USNTDP.\\n\\nOttawa Senators: C\\n\\nHoyt Stanley (D), Round 4, Pick 12\\n\\nThe Senators had no picks in the first three rounds. Stanley will be going to Cornell next season, where he will have the chance to develop NHL potential over the next few years.\\n\\nPhiladelphia Flyers: A\\n\\nMatvei Michkov (R), Round 1, Pick 7\\n\\nMichkov might not play in the NHL until 2026-27, but for a player seen by some as the best Russian prospect since Alex Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin he might be worth the wait.\\n\\nPittsburgh Penguins: B-\\n\\nBrayden Yager (C), Round 1, Pick 14\\n\\nThe Penguins cited Yager's two-way game as the reason they chose him over more highly-ranked prospects still available. He will likely need at least another season in the minors before he is ready for the NHL.\\n\\nSan Jose Sharks: A-\\n\\nWilliam Smith (C), Round 1, Pick 4; Quentin Musty (L), Round 1, Pick 26\\n\\nThe Sharks passed over Michkov in favor of Smith, who will play at Boston College next season. For a team needing improvements in the near future, having a player develop in North America is a plus. Musty, who has NHL potential as a top-six wing, is a solid late first-rounder.\\n\\nSeattle Kraken: A-\\n\\nEduard Sale (L), Round 1, Pick 20\\n\\nSale was likely the best overall asset available at No. 20. He was ranked higher on several mock draft boards after being named the top Czech league's rookie of the year last season.\\n\\nSt. Louis Blues: B\\n\\nDalibor Dvorsky (C), Round 1, Pick 10\\n\\nDvorsky was the Blues' first top-10 pick in 15 years after stellar international U18 showings for Sweden, but it remains to be seen how he will play at the NHL level. His numbers have excelled in the junior Swedish circuits but fallen when playing against pros.\\n\\nTampa Bay Lightning: B\\n\\nEthan Gauthier (R), Round 2, Pick 5\\n\\nThe Lightning did not pick until Round 2 but still found a winger with NHL potential in Gauthier, who stood out as a deft skater last year in the QMJHL.\\n\\nToronto Maple Leafs: B-\\n\\nEaston Cowan (R), Round 1, Pick 28\\n\\nCowan was not projected as a first-round pick, so his selection by the Leafs at No. 28 came as a surprise. Toronto will hope his recent surge, where he scored 18 points in 20 playoff games for the London Knights, is an indication of his ceiling.\\n\\nVancouver Canucks: B+\\n\\nTom Willander (D), Round 1, Pick 11\\n\\nThe Canucks have been \\\"very high\\\" on Willander for some time, per The Athletic's Rick Dhaliwal. They want a right-shooting defenseman to play alongside Quinn Hughes. To get their guy, however, they passed on forwards which could have added some much-needed scoring to the lineup.\\n\\nVegas Golden Knights: B+\\n\\nDavid Edstrom (C), Round 1, Pick 32\\n\\nEdstrom has proven to be a solid two-way center in the Swedish junior leagues and at international tournaments. He made his first jump to the SHL last season and has the potential to develop into an NHL center.\\n\\nWashington Capitals: B\\n\\nRyan Leonard (R), Round 1, Pick 8\\n\\nThe Capitals just missed out on Michkov and grabbed Leonard instead. Leonard was not a consensus top-10 pick, but earned power play and penalty kill experience with the USNTDP last season, upping the value of the role he could play for Washington.\\n\\nWinnipeg Jets: A-\\n\\nColby Barlow (L), Round 1, Pick 18\\n\\nBarlow's OHL highlights feature a heavy, by all appearances NHL-ready shot which helped him put up 46 goals in his draft season. Scouts report his overall game needs rounding out, but the Jets are betting they can build on that scoring potential.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"TheBlaze\", \"author\": \"Andrew Chapados\", \"title\": \"Some NHL stars 'disappointed' that league removed Pride jerseys, were 'proud wearing it'\", \"description\": \"Some of the National Hockey League's biggest stars have expressed their disappointment with the league's decision to cancel gay-pride-themed warm-up jerseys.NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said that the use of specialty warm-up jerseys had \\\"become a distraction\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.theblaze.com/news/stamkos-mcdavid-nhl-pride-jerseys\", \"text\": \"Some of the National Hockey League's biggest stars have expressed their disappointment with the league's decision to cancel gay-pride-themed warm-up jerseys.\\n\\nNHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said that the use of specialty warm-up jerseys had \\\"become a distraction\\\" and took away from the fact that all of the teams \\\"in some form or another host nights in honor of various groups or causes.\\\"\\n\\nAs reported by TimCast, some of the NHL's top stars took issue with the announcement, which was primarily in response to backlash over gay pride jerseys.\\n\\nConnor McDavid, the league's biggest star and 2022-2023 leader in goals, points, and assists, said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s disappointing to see.\\\"\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not my call, but obviously it\\u2019s disappointing,\\\" he added, according to CTV News. \\u201cI certainly can\\u2019t speak for every organization. ...

Perhaps the the advertising money and engagement that election year political speech brings are too tempting to pass up. Or maybe they\\u2019re just really committed to free expression.\\n\\n\\n\\nBelow I\\u2019ve laid out how five of the most influential social media platforms are walking the tightrope right now between providing a platform for free speech and allowing people to spread lies and conspiracy theories outright.\\n\\nWhat is Twitter\\u2019s political misinformation policy?\\n\\nTwitter\\u2019s policies regarding speech have changed drastically over the last few years. Before the October 2022 ascension of Elon Musk to CEO, Twitter was fairly locked down when it came to mis/disinformation. It banned political ads altogether in 2019. Policies against spreading lies about Covid and vaccines lead to the suspension of over 11,000 accounts during the early part of the pandemic. Controversial accounts like those of Kanye West and Donald Trump were banned even though they had millions of followers. Significantly, the service prevented the spread of links to a New York Post story about Hunter Biden\\u2019s laptop during the final weeks of the 2020 election, a move many considered a step too far.\\n\\nEverything is different now. Among the first things Elon Musk did upon taking control of Twitter was announce a policy of \\u201cGeneral Amnesty\\u201d for suspended users, overturning bans on thousands of accounts that promoted vaccine denial, general hate speech, bullying, and just about everything else. Twitter has partially reversed its 2019 ban on political advertising this year too, deciding to allow \\u201ccause-based\\u201d ads in the U.S. Musk does draw the line somewhere, though: Trump and Kanye may be free to tweet, but Alex Jones\\u2019s Twitter account remains suspended.\\n\\nHow does YouTube deal with political speech?\\n\\nAnyone who has watched YouTube already knows the company has no problem accepting ads from politicians. But until recently, it prohibited content that called elections into question. In June, YouTube reversed its election integrity policy that pledged to prohibit \\u201cfalse claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in certain past elections to determine heads of government. Or, content that claims that the certified results of those elections were false.\\u201d\\n\\nYouTube\\u2019s new policy acknowledges that removing this content curbed \\u201csome misinformation\\u201d but that it had \\u201cthe unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm.\\u201d Going forward, YouTube says it will \\u201cstop removing content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in the 2020 and other past U.S. Presidential elections.\\u201d Yay.\\n\\nHow does TikTok censor political views?\\n\\nTikTok is a frequent flashpoint for controversy, with concerns over the network\\u2019s connection to China going so far as to trigger Congressional hearings. Whether Americans\\u2019 data is safe from China is an open question, but TikTok has fairly strict policies regarding mis/disinformation. The company\\u2019s \\u201cintegrity and authenticity policy\\u201d prohibits \\u201cinaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent. Significant harm includes physical, psychological, or societal harm, and property damage.\\u201d\\n\\nTo combat misinformation and disinformation of all kinds, TikTok says it employs a small army of fact-checkers from around the world; if they confirm content to be false, TikTok \\u201cmay remove the video from our platform or make the video ineligible for recommendation into For You feeds.\\u201d TikTok does not allow \\u201cpaid political promotion, political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others)\\u201d either.\\n\\nWhat is Facebook\\u2019s policy on political ads and misinformation?\\n\\nSpeaking of political promotion, Meta\\u2019s Facebook, the world\\u2019s largest social media platform, is all over the place on the issue. After being identified as a primary source of foreign-funded disinformation in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Facebook threw up its hands and said \\u201cenough\\u201d after the polls closed in 2020. In an effort to combat \\u201cforeign interference, misinformation and voter suppression,\\u201d the company stopped accepting all political ads, an easy decision to announce after a presidential election. They have since instituted what looks like a \\u201cmiddle ground\\u201d policy around major U.S. elections: During the 2022 midterms, Facebook instituted a restriction period for \\u201cads about social issues, elections or politics in the U.S.\\u201d between Nov. 1\\u2014Nov. 8, 2022 (election day). Whether the policy will stay in place for the 2024 elections remains to be seen.\\n\\nHow does Reddit moderate misleading political speech?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s difficult to imagine what Reddit would look like if all of the misinformation it houses were removed. Reddit has no top-down comprehensive moderation policy concerning misinformation, and that\\u2019s by design. Instead, individual users invent their own moderation policies for subreddits, with whatever rules they like. If a subreddit passes some unspoken line of egregiousness, actual Reddit employees step in and \\u201cquarantine\\u201d the offensive message board, i.e. remove it from search results. It could also be banned, but this is usually caused by violating anti-harassment policy as opposed to an anti lie-about-literally-anything policy.\\n\\nFor example, Reddit banned r/nonewnormal, a vaccination and Covid conspiracy subreddit in 2021, but not for lying or worsening an international pandemic. Instead, r/NoNewNormal was axed for \\u201cbrigading\\u201d other subreddits. Reddit\\u2019s recent moves toward controlling how its unpaid moderators do their non-jobs may suggest a more heavy-handed, \\u201cwe need advertising\\u201d approach is forthcoming at the site.\\n\\nReddit does allow political ads, but promises it \\u201cforbids deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising, even among politicians. It also requires political ad buyers to \\u201cleave comments \\u2018on\\u2019 for (at least) the first 24 hours of any given campaign.\\u201d\\n\\n\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Engadget\", \"author\": \"Mariella Moon\", \"title\": \"Appeals court pauses order that restricts Biden officials from contacting social networks\", \"description\": \"Biden administration officials can freely communicate with social media companies \\u2014 for now.

According to The New York Times, the three-judge panel has ruled for Doughty's preliminary injunction to be put aside \\\"until further orders of the court.\\\"\\n\\nIf you'll recall, the state attorneys general of Louisiana and Missouri filed a lawsuit against President Joe Biden and other top government officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci. They accused the current administration of pressuring social media companies to censor certain topics and remove content. The lawsuit, the Washington Post reports, is based on emails between the administration and social networks, wherein the former questioned the companies' handling of posts on their websites containing conservative claims on the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential elections, as well as anti-vaccine sentiments.\\n\\nDoughty, a Trump-appointed judge, said the plaintiffs \\\"produced evidence of a massive effort\\\" by the defendants \\\"to suppress speech based on its content.\\\" He also wrote in his decision that if the allegations are true, \\\"the present case arguably involves the most massive attack against free speech in United States history.\\\" His order prohibits federal agencies that include the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security from asking online platforms to take down content with \\\"protected free speech.\\\" They could still, however, communicate with those entities for issues related to criminal activity, national security and election interference by foreign players.\\n\\nConservatives have long believed that mainstream social media platforms are biased against right-wing ideologies. That had led to the launch of social networks associated with conservatives, such as Parler and Donald Trump's Truth Social. The state attorneys argued that federal officials crossed the line by threatening to take antitrust actions against social networks and to limit their Section 230 protections, which allow internet companies to moderate content on their platforms as they see fit. It's worth noting that former President Trump previously signed an executive order that sought to limit federal protections offered by Section 230 after Twitter fact-checked a false tweet he posted.\\n\\nThe Justice Department appealed Doughty's order the day after it was issued, arguing that it was too broad and could limit the government's ability to warn people about false information in times of emergency. Apparently, the administration has already felt its effects after its scheduled meeting with Meta to discuss strategies on how to counter foreign disinformation campaigns was cancelled. This stay will allow federal agencies to continue working with online platforms until the court can look further into the complaint. The appeals court has ordered for the case's oral arguments to be expedited so a final decision could be reached in the near future.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"BBC News\", \"author\": \"https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews\", \"title\": \"Jared Kushner testifies in probe of Trump and the 6 Jan riots - reports\", \"description\": \"Donald Trump's son-in-law sat before a federal grand jury last month, US media report\", \"url\": \"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-66202405\", \"text\": \"Mr Trump has repeatedly claimed - with no evidence - that the 2020 election was rigged against him.

Although the country was not without its skeptics, and opportunists, by April 1897 much of the Midwest was afflicted with UFO fever.\\n\\nOn November 23, 1896, a story originally reported by the San Francisco Chronicle was picked up by many newspapers across the United States. Under various headlines\\u2014such as \\u201cAll in the Air: A Mysterious Airship Puzzles the People of California\\u201d (Minneapolis Journal), \\u201cAirship a Fact: A Son of Maine has Mastered the Secret\\u201d (Boston Daily Journal), and \\u201cAn Airship: Residents of Sacramento, Cal., Are Treated to a Rare Sight; Aerial Navigation a Reality\\u201d (Cleveland Plain Dealer)\\u2014the newspapers all reported the same general story.\\n\\nAbout 1 o\\u2019clock last Monday morning the inhabitants of Sacramento, who were astir at that hour, claim to have seen an airship passing rapidly over the city. Some merely said they saw a bright light, while others went so far as to say they saw a cigar-shaped flying machine and heard human voices from it. The residents of Oakland also say they saw the same sight a few nights ago. (Duluth News Tribune, November 23, 1896)\\n\\nPresumably in hopes of dissuading their readers of the notion the story was simply a hoax, most of the newspapers also included the following quote from the inventor\\u2019s attorney, George D. Collins:\\n\\nIt is perfectly true that there is at last a successful airship in existence and that California will have the honor of bringing it before the world. I have known of the affair for some time and am acting as attorney for the inventor. He is a very wealthy man who has been studying the subject of flying machines for fifteen years and who came here seven years ago from the state of Maine in order to be able to perfect his ideas away from the eyes of other inventors. During the last five years he has spent at least $100,000 on his work. He has not yet secured his patent, but his application is now in Washington. I cannot say much about the machine he has perfected, because he is my client and, besides, he fears that the application will be stolen from the patent office if people come to know that his invention is practicable. I saw the machine last week, at the inventor\\u2019s invitation. It is made of metal, is about 150 feet long and is built to carry fifteen persons. There was no motive power as far as I could see; certainly no steam.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is built on the aeroplane system, and has two canvas wings eighteen feet wide, and a rudder shaped like a bird\\u2019s tail. The inventor climbed into the machine and after he had been moving about the mechanism a moment, I saw the thing begin to ascend from the earth, very gently. The wings flapped slowly as it rose, and then a little faster as it began to move against the wind. (Sioux City Journal, November 23, 1896)\\n\\nThe Sioux City Journal continued, quoting Attorney Collins:\\n\\nThe reports from Sacramento, the other night, were true. It was my client\\u2019s airship that the people saw. It started from Orovill, in Butte County, and flew sixty miles in a straight line directly over Sacramento. After running up and down once or twice over the capital, my friend came right on a distance of another fifty miles and landed at a spot on the Oakland side of the bay, where the machine now lies, guarded by three men. The inventor found during his trial trip that his ship had a wave-like motion that made him seasick. It is this defect that he is now remedying.\\n\\nOn the following day, Nov. 24, 1896, the Bismarck Daily Tribune offered additional information about both the inventor and the latest test flight, again quoting Attorney Collins:\\n\\nThe inventor of the mysterious airship, which has been puzzling local scientists and others for the past week, is believed to be one \\u201cDr. E.H. Benjamin,\\u201d an alleged dentist, who occupied rooms in an Ellis Street lodging house for the past two years, but so far, he has successfully evaded all attempts to discover his identity. His attorney, Collins, when seen and pressed to tell more about the machine and its inventor, said: \\u201cThis morning the inventor came to my office in the Crocker building, and told me he had tested the merits of the ship in last night\\u2019s storm, with the greatest success\\u2026He hovered over Seal Rocks for fully 10 minutes, and played his searchlight on the seals themselves.\\u201d\\n\\nHowever, in its conclusion, the same Bismarck Daily Tribune expressed some doubt about the reports:\\n\\nA dispatch was received from Sacramento to the effect that hundreds of people there had again seen the mysterious meteor in the heavens, but as yet no one has been able to see the object sufficiently well to state definitely what it is.\\n\\nWithin a week, on November 19, 1896, The Sunday Oregonian printed an article, \\u201cThe Lair of the Faker,\\u201d exposing the mysterious airship as a prank and seemingly putting an end to the charade. The Oregonian article also contains a vitriolic critique of California\\u2019s inhabitants and the state of journalism in its neighbor to the south:\\n\\nThe fake flourishes through all the school of journals that imitate the New York World, which first used it as constant and simple stock in trade; but it has reached its most luxuriant development in San Francisco, whose newspapers print little else. It is easy to understand from the history and social conditions of California, why it should afford a soil peculiarly adapted to fake cultivation. California society unites, strangely enough, many of the human sentiments and susceptibilities of the barbaric state with those of an overripe civilization. Some forty-five years ago there was a sudden relapse there of civilized man into the conditions of primitive savagery, followed by a superficial return to civilized manners and a swift decay of human vigor, accompanied with all the morbid symptoms of racial senile gangrene that mark a declining civilization. This rapid growth and decay accomplished in one generation the work of centuries of race development in other peoples, bringing the primitive brutality of the Sabine rapture and the inconceivable degeneration of the sixth satire of Juvenal within the scope of a single life.This produced a peculiar mental receptivity of marvelous, horrible and obscene fiction, by uniting in the typical Californian of today the credulity of the barbarian with the depraved taste of over mature civilization. He will believe any lie, but he likes best lies well spiced with horror and indecency.\\n\\nAfter having shown \\u201chow universal is the fake spirit in California,\\u201d the Oregonian author turned his attention to the immediate \\u201cfake,\\u201d the mysterious airship:\\n\\nWide attention has been drawn to the newspaper story sent out from San Francisco of a mysterious airship, invented by a man from Maine, built in secret and launched from a retired spot south of San Francisco, whence it made long voyages back and forth over the length of the state\\u2026 [T]old with a clumsy imitation of all Swift\\u2019s wealth of detail, including an interview with the \\u201ccounsel\\u201d of the inventor \\u2013 a lawyer who afterward denied all knowledge of either inventor or airship. But it was swallowed gluttonously by the people of California, who blocked the streets nightly to imagine that they saw the \\u201coblong white body, enveloped in dim light,\\u201d as it traveled to and fro in the air. Apparently Californians are still gaping up into the empty night, though the falsity of the story has been proved. Of course, no person of intelligence ever believed it.\\n\\nFor several months after The Sunday Oregonian article, reports of mysterious airship sightings became scarce, suggesting it had, in fact, been a hoax. Either that or it had been flying over unpopulated areas while traversing the Rocky Mountains because by spring it was back in the news, this time over Omaha, Nebraska.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn March 30, 1897, the Idaho Daily Statesman published an article under the headline, \\u201cSaw the Airship: Reputable Omaha Citizens Witness the Passage of the Aerial Flyer,\\u201d claiming the mysterious airship \\u201ccame into view in the southeastern portion of the horizon. It was in the shape of a big, bright light, too big for a balloon, and glowed steadily.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nFour days later, on April 3, 1897, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported another sighting:\\n\\nThat mysterious airship still continues to show itself in the West. It was first seen in California, and it has now reached Kansas. With rare modesty it only makes its appearance at night, and then but little of it is visible except the lights that are on board of it. The fact that the scores of people who have seen it at different times all agree in the descriptions which they furnish is certainly something in favor of the truth of the story. As the inventor appears to be working his way East, we, in this latitude, may soon have the opportunity of adding to the number of observers.\\n\\nUnfortunately for residents of Philadelphia hoping to catch a glimpse of the mysterious airship, it allegedly turned south and was next seen above Guthrie, Oklahoma, on April 6. The Dallas Morning News published an article on April 8 titled, \\u201cStrange Object Seen: And There Shall Be Signs Seen in the Heavens;\\u201d describing the encounter:\\n\\nSoon a bright light was seen at the front of the object, which seemed to be thrown out in different directions. Mr. Trumbull called a number of people, who watched the strange shadow object for a long time and are confident it is the mysterious airship seen at so many places during the past few weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\nIts outlines were indistinct but a light was thrown out from the front, and at times there were flashes of light along the sides. It moved swiftly backward and forward, sank almost to the ground just north of the city, and then rose straight into the air at great speed and disappeared into the darkness of the night.\\n\\nOn April 14, 1897, The Philadelphia Inquirer provided additional information about the inventor and the possibility of the airship being openly displayed:\\n\\nAnd now comes the story that the directors of the trans-Mississippi Exposition to be held at Omaha have received a communication from a man who declares that he has invented an airship, and that he will disclose his identity and come to the front if the directors will guarantee him 870,000 square feet of space. He declares that the ship will carry twenty people to a height of from ten to twenty thousand feet.\\n\\nThe Inquirer article notes that ideas for nearly all new forms of transportation have been greeted with skepticism, but in due time are so thoroughly integrated in our daily lives \\u201cthe people who laughed at the thought will acknowledge the simplicity of the vessel and wonder why it was not constructed a century earlier.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nBy mid-April 1897, the Dallas Morning News was reporting a sighting nearly every day, each often more grandiose than the last. On April 15, the Dallas Morning News described a reappearance of the mysterious airship over Denton County, Texas, by \\u201cat least two credible persons\\u2026 whose reputation for truthfulness can not be assailed.\\u201d This article contained more details than nearly any published previously:\\n\\nI at first thought it was a meteor\\u2026 but upon closer examination discovered the unknown object to be almost stationary and focusing my [binoculars] on it, discovered that it was moving slowly in a southeasterly direction. At this slow rate of speed the ship continued its course for a few minutes, and then, with almost a jump, started off at a terrific rate and disappeared in the southeast, remaining in the range of my vision about twenty minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I first ascertained the character of the object it floated about a half-mile above the earth and seemed to be about fifty feet long, of a cigar shape with two great mugs thrust out from each side; a broad tail or steering sail behind and a long beak or blade resembling a cut-water on a ship in front. At the point where the search light threw its rays far into the night ahead, beside which even the luminosity of the moon paled. A row of windows along the side gave out smaller lights, the source of which must have been stored electricity, as there was no smoke, as well as I could see and I could see very plainly, coming from the ship, nor was there even a sign of a smoke-stack.\\n\\nTwo days later on April 17 the Dallas Morning News reported another detailed account of the mysterious airship, this time in Paris, Texas, about 100 miles away from Denton County. According to Mr. J.A. Black, the night watchman at the Paris Oil and Cotton Company\\u2019s plant:\\n\\nI was engaged in making my usual rounds at the mill yesterday morning about 2 o\\u2019clock when I observed a faint, but luminous object in the northeast sky\\u2026 I first thought it to be a meteor of gigantic proportions, and its speed appeared equal to such a planetary tramp. As it came nearer this idea was quickly dispelled. I ran to the cabin of a colored man by the name of Jim Smith\\u2026 and together we viewed the aerial monster as it approached nearer. From what appeared to be at first a luminous cloud there was now clearly outlined a monster airship. Myself and the negro (Smith) were held spellbound by the sight\\u2026 The ship had sails or wings outstretched on both ends there were large rotating fans projecting from the sails at an angle of about 45 degrees, the one in front being elevated, while the one at the rear was depressed, somewhat resembling the tail of a bird. We could only gain a faint idea of its accurate size, but think it must have been 200 feet long, the sails or wings constituting nine-tenths of the whole.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe cigar-shaped cabin was apparently suspended in the midst of the sails, and it was evident that the fans were propelled by some power or force located in the cabin. The noise of the propelling machinery was plainly heard as the ship sailed swiftly over us. My dog was with me when the airship was first discovered, and he immediately set up an unearthly moaning, which he continued until the curious visitor was completely lost to view. The negro was visibly affected, and being naturally superstitious lost no time in falling to his knees and offering up a prayer for the safety of himself and family. The negro even now claims the airship was none other than the return of Noah\\u2019s ark, with wing-like attachments on its way toward the Mississippi bottoms, its mission being to save the colored folks from the perils of the overflow in that section.\\n\\nThe following day, April 18, the Dallas Morning News located the craft approximately 40 miles west of Paris, Texas. Although sporadic reports of mysterious airship sightings over various Midwestern cities continued, and still do today, the Dallas Morning News outdid itself on the April 19, printing sixteen airship stories and filling four full columns.\\n\\n\\n\\nSeveral articles in this airship section are fairly typical of previous reports, consisting of brief descriptions of the airship and the location of the sighting. For example, in \\u201cSeen at West\\u201d Prof. Hickman describes seeing an airship, \\u201cwhaleback in body with bat-like wings,\\u201d which \\u201cascended rapidly until almost out of sight\\u201d and \\u201chad almost meteor-like speed.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nIn \\u201cLadonians See It,\\u201d the airship is described as \\u201ca mammoth alligator with wings outstretched.\\u201d The article \\u201cA Bank Cashier Sees It\\u201d adds an interesting twist, reporting, \\u201cNewt Gresham, captain of the Riddle Rifles and editor of the Hood County Truth, says it was a huge fish with wings.\\u201d And that Gresham \\u201ccould not stand the sight of the air machine, so he ordered the company to open fire on the object, which it did, and the whole town was soon aroused.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nOther articles in this section go further than reporting mere aerial sightings; they describe downed airships and even conversations between witnesses and the airships\\u2019 crews. In \\u201cThe Great Aerial Wonderer,\\u201d Mr. C.L. McIlhany claims to have spoken with an engineer and a pilot who \\u201chad been compelled to come to the ground to make some repairs on the machinery.\\u201d He continued:\\n\\n[The airship] consists of a cigar-shaped body about sixty feet in length, to which is attached two immense aeroplanes, and the motive power is an immense wheel at each end, in appearance much like a metallic windmill. It is driven by an immense electric engine, which derives its power from stored batteries. [The crew reported] that they have been making an experimental trip to comply with a contract with certain capitalists of New York, who are backing them. They are confident that they have achieved a great success and that in a short time the navigation of the air will be an assured fact. They refused to have their machine critically inspected and refused to talk further as to their plans for the future. They rapidly made the necessary repairs, boarded the ship and, bidding adieu to the astonished crowd assembled, the ship rose gently in the air and sailed off in a southwesterly direction.\\n\\nThe article headlined \\u201cC.G. Williams Saw It\\u201d includes a similar description of an airship and conversation with the crew, who were also engaged in a secretive business venture. Oddly enough, the crew had not landed for repairs, but rather for the altogether earthly purpose of mailing some letters. However, in a final article about business opportunities presented by the airships, titled \\u201cAirship Line,\\u201d the reporting tended back toward the incredible. It described a peculiar limitation a passenger line would face:\\n\\nFor a distance of about five miles in the Ivanhoe country the air does not contain sufficient buoyancy to float the ships. [The company] expect to overcome this difficulty by either bridging or tunneling. The stockholders, backed by the local newspapers, have all the necessary material on the ground to carry out the enterprise except the bridge and ships.\\n\\nThe last two articles from the April 19, 1897, Dallas Morning News are simply spectacular. They take us from \\u201cmysterious airships\\u201d to an unknown continent and, finally, the extraterrestrial. In \\u201cA Judge Sees It,\\u201d Judge Love tells of his conversation with an airship crew he came across while on a fishing trip. The judge offered a common description of the craft, adding it \\u201cwas capable of a speed of 250 miles an hour,\\u201d before recounting what he was told by the \\u201cfive peculiarly dressed men\\u201d:\\n\\nWe\\u2026live in the regions of the North Pole. Contrary to the general belief, there is a large body of land beyond the polar seas, containing about 250 square miles of territory. The first time this land was visited by human beings, so far as we know, was when the ten tribes of Israel found their way there after the captivity and dispersion of the Jews. According to tradition they were attempting to cross Bering Straits and were carried by a floating iceberg and landed on the shores of North Pole Land. The climate there, while at that time cold, was prevented from being uninhabitable by the influence of the gulf stream, which, after flowing for hundreds of miles many fathoms under the surface of the sea in that region, came to the surface and flows entirely around the continent of North Pole Land. You wonder how I speak English? Well, the polar expedition of Sir Hugh Willoughby in 1553, who, with his crew, was supposed to have been lost, as a matter of fact succeeded in reaching North Pole Land. The ship had been so wrecked and broken up by the voyage that Sir Willoughby and his crew were unwilling to risk a return trip; therefore they remained at North Pole Land. In the early part of 1846 Sir John Franklin\\u2019s crew reached North Pole Land. Sir John having died near what is now called Lady Franklin Bay. Sir John\\u2019s crew remained, as to return was impossible, the ship being crushed between two icebergs 100 miles from North Pole Land to which they went in boats. In addition to the foregoing, various parties in the United States and Europe from time to time reached this land in a helpless condition.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, we have a splendid country now. You know how buildings are heated by steam? Well, we have pipes through which steam is conveyed all over the inhabitable part of the country and the soil is kept at such a temperature that we can produce all the fruits of the temperate zone and some of the fruits of the tropics. The county is lighted by electricity during the six months of night. We have no timber and no coal. Water, as you know, is composed of two parts of hydrogen and one part oxygen. The oxygen burns very rapidly, giving out great heat. Now, by means of a chemical process, we take an iceberg, separate the hydrogen from the oxygen and use the latter for fuel and lights. For lack of timber we can not build ships or trains; therefore we were led to the invention of the airship.\\n\\nWhile a previously unknown continent seems beyond belief, it pales when compared to the claims made in the final Dallas Morning News article of the same day. In fact, \\u201cA Windmill Demolishes It,\\u201d is not only so fantastic it is transcribed here in its entirety, but it also concludes with a non sequitur that, literally, deserves the final word.\\n\\nAbout 6 o\\u2019clock this morning the early risers of Aurora were astonished at the sudden appearance of the airship which has been sailing through the country.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was traveling due north, and much nearer the earth than ever before. Evidently some of the machinery was out of order, for it was making a speed of only ten or twelve miles an hour and gradually settling toward the earth. It sailed directly over the public square, and when it reached the north part of town collided with the tower of Judge Proctor\\u2019s windmill and went to pieces with a terrific explosion, scattering debris over the several acres of ground, wrecking the windmill and water tank and destroying the judge\\u2019s flower garden.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe pilot of the ship is supposed to have been the only on board, and while his remains are badly disfigured, enough of the original has been picked up to show that he was not an inhabitant of this world.\\n\\n\\n\\nJr. T.J. Weems, the United States signal service officer at this place and an authority on astronomy, give it as his opinion that he was a native of the planet Mars.\\n\\n\\n\\nPapers found on his person \\u2013 evidently the record of his travels \\u2013 are written in some unknown hieroglyphics, and can not be deciphered.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ship was too badly wrecked to form any conclusion as to its construction or motive power. It was built of an unknown metal, resembling somewhat a mixture of aluminum and silver, and it must have weighed several tons.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe town is full of people to-day who are viewing the wreck and gathering specimens of the strange metal from the debris. The pilot\\u2019s funeral will take place at noon to-morrow.\\n\\nFor more information about America\\u2019s Historical Newspapers, or to request a trial for your institution, please contact readexmarketing@readex.com.\\n\\n\"}, {\"source_name\": \"The Guardian\", \"author\": \"Adam Gabbatt\", \"title\": \"It came out of the sky: UFO claims to get their day in Congress\", \"description\": \"US House panel to hold first public hearing on extraterrestrial question following whistleblower claim of \\u2018intact\\u2019 alien vehiclesFor decades, US politicians have been reluctant to get involved in the topic of UFOs and aliens.After a series of disclosures in r\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/21/ufos-congress-alien-house-committee-whistleblower\", \"text\": \"For decades, US politicians have been reluctant to get involved in the topic of UFOs and aliens.\\n\\nAfter a series of disclosures in recent months, however, Republicans and Democrats now appear to be lining up to inquire into the question of extraterrestrial life, as the world seems closer than ever to finding out whether we are alone in the universe.\\n\\nNext week, the House oversight committee will hold its first public hearing as part of its investigation into UFOs, weeks after a whistleblower former intelligence official went public with claims that the government has possession of \\u201cintact and partially intact\\u201d alien vehicles.\\n\\nDavid Grusch\\u2019s allegations about the government harboring alien craft \\u2013 he has since suggested that the US has also encountered \\u201cmalevolent\\u201d alien pilots \\u2013 sparked the 26 July hearing, and beyond that, appear to have lit a fire under the Washington establishment.\\n\\nThe Republican party has led the initial charge, with a series of claims about extraterrestrial life that, until recently, would have been seen as career-ending.\\n\\nTim Burchett, the Republican congressman from Tennessee who is co-leading the UFO investigation, declared in early July that alien craft possess technology that could \\u201cturn us into a charcoal briquette\\u201d, while a Republican colleague suggested that extraterrestrial interlopers could actually be representatives of an ancient civilization.\\n\\nIn a briefing on Thursday, Burchett said he and his co-investigator Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member from Florida, had been \\u201cstonewalled\\u201d by federal officials when asking about UFOs, and prevented from accessing some \\u201cinformation to prove that they do exist\\u201d.\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019ve had a heck of a lot of pushback about this hearing.

These parameters act as placeholders that can be easily modified to generate tailored reports based on specific inputs or conditions, enabling seamless updates to reports without the need for manual modifications. Quarto, a modern and flexible document generation tool, provides excellent support for parameterised reporting.\\n\\nIn this blog, we will be looking at a Quarto Reveal JS presentation as an example. By defining parameters within a Quarto presentation, you can easily add flexibility and interactivity to your presentations, allowing you to tailor the content to the specific needs or preferences of your audience.\\n\\nData comes in all shapes and sizes. It can often be difficult to know where to start. Whatever your problem, Jumping Rivers can help.\\n\\nCreating a Reveal JS presentation\\n\\nYou can easily create a Reveal JS presentation in RStudio with File > New File > Quarto Presentation > Reveal JS . This will create a Quarto file (let\\u2019s call it slides.qmd ) as usual. We are going to be using a slightly modified version of the TidyTuesday data set on UFO sightings. The CSV file for the data set is available on our GitHub. In this data set, we have information on UFO sightings between 2019 and 2022 from different US states.\\n\\nWe will update the YAML for our presentation to add a title as well as update the theme to make it look a little bit nicer.\\n\\n--- title: \\\"UFO Sightings\\\" format: revealjs: theme: simple ---\\n\\nWe\\u2019ll also add some general package-loading and data-reading code to the top of our presentation.\\n\\nlibrary(\\\"dplyr\\\") library(\\\"ggplot2\\\") ufo_sightings = readr::read_csv(\\\"ufo_sightings.csv\\\")\\n\\nLet\\u2019s say we wanted to include a histogram of UFO sighting durations in our presentation. For Idaho in 2022, the code would look something like this:\\n\\nufo_subset = ufo_sightings %>% dplyr::filter( year == 2022, state_name == \\\"Idaho\\\" )\\n\\nto create a subset of the full UFO sighting data set and then:\\n\\nufo_subset %>% ggplot(aes(x = duration_seconds)) + geom_histogram(fill = \\\"#c74a4a\\\") + labs(x = \\\"Duration (seconds)\\\", y = \\\"\\\") + scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma_format()) + theme_minimal()\\n\\nto create the histogram itself. We can then add this to a slide of our presentation and add the heading \\u201cSighting duration\\u201d.\\n\\nUsing parameters in Quarto\\n\\nNow, what if we wanted to create this plot but for another state-year combination. This is where we need parameters.\\n\\nTo add parameters to your Quarto document or presentation, you need to use the params option in the YAML. We want to be able to generate our report flexibly with different combinations of US state and year, so we will create a parameter for each of them. We will use Idaho and 2022 as the default values for these parameters.\\n\\n--- title: \\\"UFO Sightings\\\" format: revealjs: theme: simple params: state: \\\"Idaho\\\" year: 2022 ---\\n\\nThese parameters are then stored in the params list accessible from within your presentation. So we can now update our code from before to instead rely on params$year and params$state instead of the hard-coded year and state.\\n\\nufo_subset = ufo_sightings %>% dplyr::filter( year == params$year, state_name == params$state )\\n\\nNow, our plot will automatically update each time we re-generate the presentation with different parameters.\\n\\nBefore we go through how to actually generate the presentation with different values than the defaults, let\\u2019s first also add a subtitle to the presentation which will change as the parameters change. So, something like:\\n\\n--- title: \\\"UFO Sightings\\\" subtitle: \\\"`r params$state`, `r params$year`\\\" format: revealjs: theme: simple params: state: \\\"Idaho\\\" year: 2022 ---\\n\\nRender with parameters\\n\\nTo render our presentation with different parameters, we have a few different options.\\n\\nIf you prefer to render your presentation using an R function, you can use quarto::quarto_render() to render your presentation. You\\u2019ll just need to provide the input .qmd file, as well as a list of the parameters with the execute_params argument. So, if you wanted to generate the presentation for Alabama in 2021 this time, your command would look something like:\\n\\nquarto::quarto_render(input = \\\"slides.qmd\\\", execute_params = list(\\\"year\\\" = 2021, \\\"state\\\" = \\\"Alabama\\\"))\\n\\nIf you\\u2019d rather render your presentation from the command line, you can also easily do so with the quarto render command paired with the -P parameter flag.\\n\\nquarto render slides.qmd -P year:2021 -P state:\\\"Alabama\\\"\\n\\nYou can also supply a YAML file of key:value pairings when rendering your presentation with parameters. Simply create a file called params.yml , and define your parameters. To change the parameters for a new run, you can just update your YAML file.\\n\\nYour YAML file would look something like:\\n\\n# in params.yml year: 2020 state: 'Alabama'\\n\\nand then, to render:\\n\\nquarto render slides.qmd --execute-params params.yml\\n\\nRendering multiple parameter combinations at once\\n\\nBeing able to render a presentation with different parameters is useful. But let\\u2019s say you needed a single presentation for each combination of state and year. You\\u2019d end up needing to manually render 250 separate presentations. So, we want to automate rendering multiple combinations of parameters at once.\\n\\nInstead of rendering 250 files, let\\u2019s take a sample of 3 states and 2 years, so we\\u2019ll end up with 6 presentations in total. We then create a tibble of the year-state combinations we want to generate presentations for:\\n\\nyears = unique(ufo_sightings$year)[1:2] states = unique(ufo_sightings$state_name)[1:3] params = tidyr::crossing( year = years, state = states ) params\\n\\nYou can then either build a for loop or use the {purrr} package to iterate over the state-year combinations. If you want to learn more about iteration, check out our Programming with R and our Functional Programming with purrr courses.\\n\\nHere, we\\u2019re using the walk2() function from {purrr} to iterate over the different year-state combinations to create multiple files. The walk2() function lets you iterate over two inputs simultaneously and is used when your function has a side effect, such as writing a file, rather than wanting the output returned as an R object.\\n\\nWe also include our input parameters in the output file name to allow us to distinguish between the multiple output files:\\n\\npurrr::walk2(params$year, params$state, ~quarto::quarto_render( input = \\\"slides.qmd\\\", execute_params = list(\\\"year\\\" = .x, \\\"state\\\" = .y), output_file = glue::glue(\\\"{.y}_{.x}.html\\\") ))\\n\\nRunning this command, you end up with 6 aptly named output files:\\n\\nAnd there you have it! Generating multiple presentations or reports at once is a fairly straightforward process when using Quarto to render your outputs. You can of course extend this logic and create much more in-depth reports or presentations with different kinds of outputs, including text summaries, which depend on input parameters.\\n\\nTo see the full code behind this blog post, as well as some further examples in a more fleshed out Quarto report, check out the blogs repo on our GitHub.\\n\\nFor updates and revisions to this article, see the original post\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Atlas Obscura\", \"author\": \"ugc\", \"title\": \"Mount Ishimaki in Toyohashi, Japan\", \"description\": \"Mount Ishimaki is an unusual mountain.

Join Longreads and help us to support more writers.\\n\\nLong before the 1947 Roswell incident brought \\u201clittle green men\\u201d into the public consciousness and prompted an explosion in UFO sightings, writers and scientists have speculated about the existence of life beyond our planet. H. G. Wells laid the groundwork for modern science fiction with novels like The War of the Worlds (1898), one of the first books to imagine an extraterrestrial invasion. Before Wells, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli (1835-1910) sparked the imagination by discovering \\u201ccanals\\u201d on Mars. But for the first recorded instance of humanity pondering the possibility of alien life, we have to go all the way back to ancient Greek and Roman times. In the first century B.C., Roman poet Lucretius wrote, \\u201cNothing in the universe is unique and alone and therefore in other regions there must be other earths inhabited by different tribes of men and breeds of beast.\\u201d Not exactly a controversial supposition; still, whether or not such tribes have come to our planet remains impossible to prove, and those who claim to have encountered alien beings have long been dismissed.\\n\\nThat said, in recent years, the concept of otherworldly visitors has begun to shift toward the mainstream. In 2022, the U.S. Department of Defense established the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, the latest governmental entity devoted to investigating unexplained sightings. Even the term of choice, \\u201cUFO,\\u201d has given way to \\u201cUAP\\u201d\\u2014unidentified aerial (or anomalous) phenomenon. And just this June, former U.S. Air Force officer and intelligence official David Grusch claimed that the U.S. government had retrieved remains of several aircraft of \\u201cnon-human\\u201d origin. The fallout from Grusch\\u2019s claims is yet to be determined\\u2014as is their veracity\\u2014but it seems likely that, in the end, the world will settle back into the binary of believers and skeptics, with no concrete evidence to settle the debate. Regardless of which camp you fall into, some of us will always look skyward with hope; we may never be able to scour the entirety of the universe, but it\\u2019s hard not to thrill to Lucretius\\u2019 logic. In the meantime, the longform articles collected here offer a fascinating glimpse into the UFO community and the stories that have shaped our modern understanding of the topic.\\n\\nI Want To Believe (Brad Badelt, Maisonneuve, July 2021)\\n\\nFor me, what makes alleged alien encounter testimony so compelling is that\\u2014regardless of whether I believe the person\\u2019s interpretation of events\\u2014the incident had an undeniable and profound effect on their lives. This may not be true in every case, but even if you write off many accounts as delusion or whimsy or simply fiction, you\\u2019re still left with a legion of people who have been dramatically changed by their perceived experiences. It\\u2019s comforting to know, then, that for those such as Jason Guillemette, a character in this piece about amateur ufologists, communities exist where one can share their experiences without judgment.\\n\\nIn Guillemette\\u2019s case, that community is the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), a non-profit, volunteer-run organization active in more than 40 countries\\u2014and one whose members are as rigidly skeptical as Guillemette. For most MUFON alumni, this is a quest for truth, not validation; members work rigorously to find earthly explanations for reported sightings. And as Badelt widens his scope to other folks in other organizations, you can\\u2019t help but be moved by people\\u2019s stories. After all, if you were to have a life-changing close encounter, with whom would you share that knowledge?\\n\\nMost of the time, he\\u2019s able to find an explanation, he says. He often sends videos to other volunteers at MUFON who specialize in analyzing computer images. He refers to websites that track the flight patterns of satellites and planes and the International Space Station\\u2014the usual suspects when it comes to UFO sightings, he says. Guillemette described a recent case in which a couple reported seeing strange lights hovering above a nearby lake. The lights circled above the lake and then dropped down into the water, only to rise up a moment later and zip away. It turned out to be a plane, he says\\u2014filling up with water to fight a nearby forest fire. \\u201cNot everybody likes what we come up with,\\u201d he says, \\u201cbut sometimes it\\u2019s really evident.\\u201d\\n\\nCrowded Skies (Vaughan Yarwood, New Zealand Geographic, April 1997)\\n\\nThe history of UFO sightings in New Zealand dates back to the early 20th century. It seems such a tranquil and unassuming country\\u2014cinematic hobbit history notwithstanding\\u2014which perhaps makes the events recounted here even more unsettling. These are all-too-human tales of altered lives. Some cases, such as that of Iris Catt, a self-proclaimed alien abductee whose nightmarish encounters go back to her childhood, are heartbreakingly tragic. Others follow more positive narratives, believing that aliens are beaming down rays of positivity and openness, gradually bringing humanity to a point where it is ready for formal communication.\\n\\nWhen I was at university in the 1990s, \\u201cregression therapy\\u201d became big news, with countless stories of trauma-blocked memories and past-life remembrances unearthed through hypnosis. Just as suddenly, regression therapy drowned in a flood of peer-reviewed criticism, relegated to yet another pseudoscience. The concept never went away entirely and it pops up again in Vaughan Yarwood\\u2019s story, cautiously approved by academic institutions for its utility in specific circumstances. It\\u2019s complex territory, but Yarwood navigates it with clarity and sensitivity.\\n\\nIris Catt, a mild-mannered, unprepossessing woman in her 40s, then introduces herself. She is an abductee. It appears certain aliens have had their eye on her from an early age. She recounts her night horrors calmly, the way people do who have learned to accept their scars, to make their hurt and anguish a part of themselves. \\u201cIt is happening every day, and it is happening in New Zealand,\\u201d says Iris. \\u201cIt is not going to go away. I truly believe that more and more people are beginning to remember what is happening to them because the time is getting closer when we are going to have to recognise that we are not the only intelligent form of life in the universe.\\u201d Her audience understands. She is among friends.\\n\\nAlien Nation (Ralph Blumenthal, Vanity Fair, May 2013)\\n\\nHarvard Medical School psychiatrist John Edward Mack spent many years engaging with people who claimed to have been abducted by extraterrestrials, in the process becoming a pioneer in his field. Not surprisingly, he attracted resistance from the scientific community\\u2014less because of his work than because, over time, he came to the startling and highly controversial conclusion that a number of alleged abductees were telling the truth. Mack\\u2019s research may be little remembered by his profession at large, but his warmth, humanity, and faith continue to inspire hope in a small community that gathers annually in Rhode Island. They prefer the term \\u201cexperiencer\\u201d to \\u201cabductee,\\u201d and in this Vanity Fair feature Ralph Blumenthal interweaves their stories with Mack\\u2019s.\\n\\nFor more about one of the characters in Blumenthal\\u2019s story, a 1994 feature in Omni details Linda\\u2019s alleged experience.\\n\\nOnce again, for me, the fascination of this piece lies in the stories of these everyday folks. To some degree, it doesn\\u2019t matter what they actually experienced. What counts, as Mack understood, is they have experienced something, and that something left a profound mark on their lives. In seeking to apply rigor and structure to the stories he was collecting, Mack plowed a hard path with poise and compassion. As this piece eloquently shows, his work was not in vain.\\n\\n\\u201cNothing in my nearly 40 years of familiarity with psychiatry prepared me,\\u201d Mack later wrote in his 1994 best-seller, Abduction: Human Encounters with Aliens. He had always assumed that anyone claiming to have been abducted by aliens was crazy, along with those who took them seriously. But here were people\\u2014students, homemakers, secretaries, writers, businesspeople, computer technicians, musicians, psychologists, a prison guard, an acupuncturist, a social worker, a gas-station attendant\\u2014reporting experiences that Mack could not begin to fathom, things, he reflected, that by all notions of reality \\u201csimply could not be.\\u201d\\n\\nI have long been fascinated with the so-called Wow signal, received in 1977 by Ohio University\\u2019s Big Ear radio telescope, which was then being used to search for evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence. The tale of the signal makes for a great story in itself, but Keith Cooper\\u2019s piece sees that as merely a starting point. His narrative finds a central character in a man named Robert Gray: While the scientific community, including SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), gradually lowered the Wow signal to the status of \\u201cinteresting curio,\\u201d Gray remained convinced that there was more to uncover.\\n\\nGray\\u2019s tenacity and belief in the face of mounting opposition is remarkable. Struggling for funding, unsuccessfully attempting to enlist help, and bartering for much-needed time on a limited number of radio telescopes, the frustrations he must have experienced make the twists in his story all the more poignant. Just when his enthusiasm began to wane, his work seemingly at a dead end, an exoplanet scientist reached out to Gray with a fresh idea, breathing new life into the man\\u2019s relentless quest. There is no neat, satisfying definitive end to this tale, but perhaps therein lies the true glory of Gray\\u2019s work. In the face of uncertainty, he carried on until the very end.\\n\\nNobody knows what the Wow signal was. We do know that it was not a regular astrophysical object, such as a galaxy or a pulsar. Curious the frequency that it was detected at, 1,420 MHz, is the frequency emitted by neutral hydrogen atoms in space, but it is also the frequency that scientists hunting for alien life listen to. Their reasoning is that aliens will supposedly know that astronomers will already be listening to that frequency in their studies of galactic hydrogen and so should easily detect their signal \\u2013 or so the theory goes. Yet there was no message attached to the signal. It was just a burst of raw radio energy. If SETI had a mythology, then the Wow signal would be its number one myth. And while it has never been forgotten by the public, the academic side of SETI has, by and large, dismissed it, quite possibly because it hasn\\u2019t been seen to repeat, and therefore cannot be verified\\u2014the golden rule of a successful SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) detection.\\n\\nCelebrities who have copped to believing in UFOs are numerous enough to populate a listicle. Politicians? Not so much. Yet, the U.S. Congress\\u2019 House Oversight Committee has announced plans for a hearing regarding UAP reports, and if you trace the conversation back a few years, you\\u2019ll find that this shift is at least partly thanks to the protagonists in this story: former U.S. senator Harry Reid and Tom DeLonge, a founding member of pop-punk band Blink 182.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a lot to digest here. It\\u2019s a wonderful example of hidden history: a small group of like-minded individuals working behind the scenes to advance their cause, with potentially wide-ranging repercussions. That history would be far less engaging, however, were it not for Tom DeLonge\\u2019s gregarious personality and indefatigable belief in alien visitors. His company, To The Stars, devotes considerable time and money to researching UAPs and extraterrestrial matters in general; Bryan Bender\\u2019s feature tells the story of how the singer managed to recruit experts and politicians to his cause.\\n\\nHanging on DeLonge\\u2019s wall was what might be considered the medals he\\u2019s collected in his struggle: a display case filled with dozens of commemorative coins from his meetings with generals, aerospace contractors and secret government agencies. They trace his visits to the CIA, to the U.S. Navy, to the \\u201cadvanced development programs\\u201d division at Lockheed Martin\\u2019s famously secretive \\u201cSkunk Works\\u201d in Southern California, where some of the world\\u2019s most advanced spy planes were designed.\\n\\nChris Wheatley is a writer and journalist based in Oxford, U.K. He has too many guitars, too many records, and not enough cats.\\n\\nEditor: Peter Rubin\\n\\nCopy Editor: Krista Stevens\"}, {\"source_name\": \"PC Gamer\", \"author\": \"Rick Lane\", \"title\": \"Xenonauts 2 is a comprehensive but overly safe tribute to classic X-COM\", \"description\": \"Expect brutal combat and mounting panic as you save the world from aliens again, but don't expect much that's new.\", \"url\": \"https://www.pcgamer.com/xenonauts-2-is-a-comprehensive-but-overly-safe-tribute-to-classic-x-com/\", \"text\": \"The problem with saving the world from alien invasion is it can be difficult to know what to do next.\\n\\nTransforming a clandestine global organisation from being clay pigeons for alien sharpshooters into the kind of force that can take down extraterrestrial motherships is an experience that's difficult to beat, and every successful X-COM game has grappled with following up such an alluring premise. Julian Gollop looked to the sea for inspiration, resulting in 1995's Terror from the Deep. Firaxis's XCOM 2, meanwhile, solved the problem with a clever bit of retconning. \\\"Surprise sucker, you lost!\\\" it yelled in the player's bewildered face. \\\"Now you're fighting a guerrilla campaign against a hybrid human-alien dictatorship! How do you like THOSE bananas?\\\"\\n\\nBoth games were ingenious ways of building a sequel that followed logically from the first game, while reinvigorating the entire concept at the same time. By comparison, Xenonauts 2's response is \\\"What if you saved the world again, but\\u2026 more?\\\"\\n\\nThat premise has stood the test of time for a reason, and Xenonauts 2's variant is both broad in its canvas and rich with detail. But as I ferried my Nth dropship of grey-suited soldiers to their probable death, I couldn't help but feel like the novelty had worn a teensy bit thin.\\n\\nThe 2014 Xenonauts emerged from a desire to restore all the '90s tactical cruft that Firaxis' XCOM reboot surgically removed. Like its predecessor, Xenonauts 2 scoffs at XCOM's starting squad size of four soldiers, stuffing your dropship with nine sentient blood-bags from the first mission onward. Overwatch isn't an ability you activate, its range and spread delineated by an obnoxious blue cone. It's just something that happens if any unit has sufficient time points in reserve, making every step toward your alien foes a heart-stopping gamble. Your soldiers must be directly instructed to turn to face enemies and crouch behind cover, all of which cost precious time points and will mark the difference between life and death.\\n\\nAs someone who has played new XCOM but not old X-COM, I found these differences to be challenging at first. And by challenging, I mean fucking infuriating. Didn't check the corners of that barn you just entered? Well, there's a lizard the size of Dave Bautista hiding behind the wood-chipper, so you're dead.\\n\\nForgot to change your sniper's ammo clips when you gave him that snazzy laser rifle? WELL, he's run out of ammo three turns in, and is now about as much use as an anal probe.\\n\\nDon\\u2019t have X-ray vision to see through the fog of war that obscures every unchecked tile on the map? WELL, you just got shot from across an entire dockyard because you couldn't predict the future.\\n\\nImage 1 of 4 (Image credit: Goldhawk Interactive) (Image credit: Goldhawk Interactive) (Image credit: Goldhawk Interactive) (Image credit: Goldhawk Interactive)\\n\\nFiraxis was 100% right to remove this stuff from the reboot. Had I been forced to grapple with such fiddly squad management back in 2012, I'd have binned it off faster than a birthday card from Hitler. However, as classic X-COM fans will tell you at any given opportunity, this extra layer is there for a reason, and the more I played, the more I understood why.\\n\\nTactics advanced\\n\\nYes, losing a xenonaut because you didn't turn them forty-five degrees is annoying. But that same system can help you guard your flanks as you advance through the map, or deftly navigate around an alien's overwatch, as orientation impacts their ability to respond as much as yours. Most of the game's mechanics work like this. An enemy that explodes on death is dangerous to everyone around it, no matter how many limbs or nostrils or pancreases they have.\\n\\nThere are some elements to the tactical layer that I unambiguously dislike, getting shot from halfway across the map by an enemy in the black void being one of them. But there are equally elements that I prefer over Firaxis' design, like the wide range of fire modes that most weapons have. One of Xenonauts 2's great satisfactions is switching out a high-accuracy single shot for a low-accuracy three-round burst and seeing every bullet thud into your target, shortly before they thud into the ground.\\n\\nThere are new elements to the tactical layer too. The way vehicles are implemented into the game has been adjusted. Replacing Xenonauts' bulky, manned scout car is an automated weapons platforms that occupies a single tile like your soldiers. Easier to manoeuvre, it's useful for initial recon of a mission area, while its missile banks are great for dealing with large groups of enemies. These platforms are also modular, and can be equipped with new and upgraded weapons just like your soldiers can. They're big metal bullseyes for the aliens and get destroyed easily, but they're a lot easier to put back together than a person.\\n\\n(Image credit: Goldhawk Interactive)\\n\\nOnce your Xenonauts have completed a mission (or died trying), the game zooms out to the global view of the Geoscape. Here you research new tech, construct new weapons and equipment, manage and expand your base (and build new ones), and watch the skies for sightings of UFOs and other alien activity. It's very familiar, a point I'll elaborate on later. But one thing Xenonauts has to its advantage is variety. Missions are diverse, ranging from thwarting abduction and terror events to salvaging the wreckage of increasingly large and dangerous UFOs. Almost every new mission sees you facing some new threat or trying out new weapons and equipment. Objectives are neatly breadcrumbed through the game too, even if many of them are your typical capture a UFO/alien affair.\\n\\nYou always want to see what's going to happen next, which is as much a testament to XCOM's enduring premise as it is Xenonauts' own design.\\n\\nIdentified flying objects\\n\\nThere are two criticisms that I'd level at Xenonauts 2. The first is unfair but true nonetheless: it lacks the dramatic flair seen in Firaxis' games. Goldhawk conjures what fireworks it can, and there are artful flourishes throughout. The music is suitably foreboding, while the text reports you receive for alien autopsies and major story beats are evocative and detailed. I also like the short summaries of world events that appear and fade as time passes on the Geoscape, disappearing journalists, political assassination, vast \\\"dead zones\\\" appearing in the ocean. It feels suitably eerie and threatening.\\n\\nBut I love XCOM pulpy bombast, and Xenonauts' more austere presentation just doesn't speak to me in the same way. One issue that particularly bugged me was the measly audio effects on weapons. Yes, an M16 rifle is practically prehistoric compared to an alien plasma gun, but ripping open a Secton with an M16 should still feel satisfying. Instead, it's like shooting bubbles at a bag of flour. Later weapons are a little better, but not much, and none of your xenonauts' actions have much sense of physicality.\\n\\nMy bigger concern is the one that I alluded to at the start\\u2014for all Xenonauts does well, there's precious little here that's new or surprising. Xenonauts' biggest divergence from XCOM is how it lets you assume control over the interception of UFOs, directing your fighters from a top-down, radar-like perspective as they dance around the alien craft trading missiles and gatling-gun fire. But by Goldhawk Interactive's own admission, this feature isn't ready in the early access version. It's technically playable, but needs considerable balancing and refinement, to the point where the developers currently encourage you to skip it.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Goldhawk also attempts to spice up how familiar the first few hours feel with the addition of the Cleaners, a mysterious human faction working in concert with the aliens. Much of the early game revolves around dismantling the Cleaner operation, raiding their offices to steal their data, assassinating their regional leaders to hinder their operations, and ultimately assaulting their headquarters. It's a cool idea. The problem is the Cleaners never feel like much of a threat. All my encounters with the Cleaners put me on the offensive\\u2014at no point did I have to respond to or defend myself from anything the Cleaners did.\\n\\nImage 1 of 5 (Image credit: Goldhawk Interactive) (Image credit: Goldhawk Interactive) (Image credit: Goldhawk Interactive) (Image credit: Goldhawk Interactive) (Image credit: Goldhawk Interactive)\\n\\nThe early access version, launching July 18, provides a mostly complete campaign experience, although it becomes visibly less finished as you progress, with missing descriptions for certain events and objectives, and a latter phase that currently feels anaemic. Still, If you're happy to play XCOM again, then Xenonauts 2 is a perfectly acceptable way to do that.\\n\\nShooting down UFOs and then sending vulnerable humans to secure the crash site is a loop that still works for me, and Xenonauts' classically minded tactics are as rewarding as they are ruthless. But I wouldn't have said no to something more daring, that tried a little harder to put a new spin on an old adversary.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Twistedsifter.com\", \"author\": \"Matthew Gilligan\", \"title\": \"People Share the Things They\\u2019d Be Able to Talk About With No Preparation\", \"description\": \"I can talk ALL day about MySpace. :-D\", \"url\": \"http://twistedsifter.com/2023/07/people-share-the-things-theyd-be-able-to-talk-about-for-30-minutes-with-no-preparation/\", \"text\": \"\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Snopes.com\", \"author\": \"Alex Kasprak\", \"title\": \"Fact Check: Did US Rep.

Tim Burchett said that the U.S. government has covered up evidence of UFOs since 1947. Rating: About this rating Correct Attribution\\n\\nOn July 10, 2023, Fox News Host Jesse Waters asked U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., if he knew of evidence \\\"that the government has this crazy alien stuff and is keeping it from us?\\\"\\n\\nHis question, at least in part, stemmed from Burchett's appearance on the podcast Event Horizon, where Burchett discussed his work on the U.S. House Oversight Committee and its efforts to declassify what the Department of Defense (DOD) describes as unexplained anomalous phenomena (UAP) but what are popularly termed Unidentified Flying Objects, or UFOs.\\n\\nIn June 2023, that committee announced that it would hold a hearing into the claims of David Grusch, a former DOD staffer who led that department's analysis of UAP and who claimed that the government had been collecting non-human-made aircrafts/spacecrafts for decades. Burchett was one of two congressmen preparing for that hearing.\\n\\nOn the Event Horizon podcast Burchett said that, in theory, such technology could turn humans into \\\"into a charcoal briquette.\\\" This comment inspired the chyron Fox News used for the Waters interview segment:\\n\\nIn response to Waters' question about \\\"crazy alien stuff,\\\" Burchett described the activity of some UAP observed by military personnel, videos of which were released by the DOD in 2021, highlighting the impossibility of the purported technology shown in the videos if human made.\\n\\nIn his response, Burchett reiterated Grusch's claim that the government has recovered alien technology and suggested that the U.S. has been covering this up since 1947 \\u2014 the year of the notorious Roswell, New Mexico, incident \\u2014 if not earlier:\\n\\nSome of these craft that you're watching right there, they have no heat trail. They defy every bit of physics that we know about. They can fly underwater or swim underwater, [...] And they basically have no friction and there is no heat trail. [...] We don't have any idea what's propelling them. [...] If Putin had a U F O, he'd land the thing on the White House lawn, probably get out, ride a unicorn bare-chested over to the president and punch him in the mouth and then ride back to Mother Russia. If the Chinese had it, they'd own us. [...] So you're left with one other conclusion. These things are coming from somewhere else, and this has been covered up since 1947 or sooner. [... ] We've been dealing with this at least since 1947, probably since about 1893, I believe, was the Aurora, Texas [UFO sighting incident].\\n\\nThe Aurora, Texas, event Burchett referenced occurred allegedly in 1897. The legend was spawned by a newspaper item submitted to The Dallas Morning News for publication April 19, 1897, in which the author, S. E. Haydon, asserted that an airship of alien origin had crashed into a local judge's windmill, and that an officer with the United States signal service believed its origin to have been Mars:\\n\\nThe pilot of the ship is supposed to be the only one on board, and while his remains are badly disfigured, enough of the original has been picked up to show that he was not an inhabitant of this world. Mr. T. J. Weems, the United States signal service officer at this place and an authority on astronomy, gives it as his opinion that he was a native of the planet Mars. Papers found on his person \\u2014 evidently the record of his travels \\u2014 are written in some unknown hieroglyphics, and can not be deciphered.\\n\\nLater reporting revealed that \\\"officer\\\" T. J. Weems was, in reality, a local blacksmith and not part of the U.S. government. The Aurora event is now largely considered to have been a hoax.\\n\\nHowever, because Burchett did allege \\u2014 and has on many other occasions \\u2014 that the U.S. government has been hiding evidence of its collection of alien spacecraft since at least 1947, we rate the claim about his comment as \\\"Correctly Attributed.\\\"\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Blogdumoderateur.com\", \"author\": \"Matthieu Eug\\u00e8ne\", \"title\": \"ChatGPT : 10 exemples pour d\\u00e9couvrir le plugin Code Interpreter\", \"description\": \"OpenAI a d\\u00e9ploy\\u00e9 un plugin nomm\\u00e9 Code Interpreter pour les abonn\\u00e9s \\u00e0 ChatGPT Plus, permettant \\u00e0 l'IA d'ex\\u00e9cuter du code et d'analyser des donn\\u00e9es complexes.\", \"url\": \"https://www.blogdumoderateur.com/chatgpt-code-interpreter-10-exemples/\", \"text\": \"Qu\\u2019est-ce que Code Interpreter ?\\n\\nLe 6 juillet, OpenAI a d\\u00e9ploy\\u00e9 un nouveau plugin pour ChatGPT nomm\\u00e9 Code Interpreter.

De hecho, no creemos que exageremos al decir que algunos de los momentos m\\u00e1s ic\\u00f3nicos y memorables que hemos vivido en este hobby son recordados, precisamente, por la aparici\\u00f3n de alg\\u00fan tema concreto, transformando as\\u00ed una gran secuencia, fase o escena de v\\u00eddeo en algo \\u00e9pico e inolvidable.\\n\\nHoy es el D\\u00eda Mundial del Rock, un g\\u00e9nero musical que siempre ha estado muy relacionado con el ocio electr\\u00f3nico. A fin de cuentas, \\u00bfqu\\u00e9 mejor que alg\\u00fan temazo de este tipo para acompa\\u00f1ar la acci\\u00f3n de un videojuego? Por eso, hoy en Vandal hemos decidido dedicarle un homenaje seleccionando algunas de nuestras bandas sonoras favoritas en las que el rock y el metal son las grandes protagonistas. Para darle algo m\\u00e1s de variedad a esta lista, hemos escogido una \\u00fanica entrega por saga y hemos intentado que haya cierto equilibrio entre los t\\u00edtulos que cuenten con m\\u00fasica licenciada y aquellos que apuesten por composiciones originales. Y dicho esto, \\u00a1comenzamos!\\n\\nGuitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock\\n\\nSi hay un g\\u00e9nero en el que la m\\u00fasica es especialmente vital ese es, obviamente, el de los juegos musicales, ya que pierden casi todo su atractivo sin una buena lista de temas que nos animen a jugar. Aunque ahora est\\u00e1n un poco de capa ca\\u00edda, hace unos a\\u00f1os era normal ver en las tiendas un buen pu\\u00f1ado de t\\u00edtulos pensados para ser jugados con instrumentos de pl\\u00e1stico, una moda en la que la saga Guitar Hero fue la gran abanderada y que acab\\u00f3 culminando con su tercera entrega. Tanto es as\\u00ed que estamos ante una de las mayores y mejores selecciones de canciones y artistas que se ha hecho nunca para videojuego alguno. En total, m\\u00e1s de 70 temazos de grupos como Rage Against the Machine, Iron Maiden, Metallica, The Rolling Stones, Black Sabbath, KISS, Aerosmith o Guns N\\u2019 Roses, por mencionar tan solo unos poqu\\u00edsimos ejemplos, algo a lo que hay que sumarle duelos tan emocionantes como los que ten\\u00edamos contra Slash, Tom Morello o el mism\\u00edsimo Diablo. Y s\\u00ed, no nos olvidamos de la infernal \\\"Through The Fire and Flames\\\" de Dragonforce, una de las canciones m\\u00e1s dif\\u00edciles, intensas y espectaculares a las que nos hemos enfrentado nunca en juego musical alguno.\\n\\nMarvel\\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy\\n\\nMarvel\\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy es un juego que solo por su selecci\\u00f3n de temas licenciados ya tiene su hueco m\\u00e1s que ganado en esta lista, ofreci\\u00e9ndonos un fant\\u00e1stico homenaje a la d\\u00e9cada de los 80 que incluye canciones tan m\\u00edticas como \\\"The Final Countdown\\\" de Europe, \\\"I Love It Loud\\\" de KISS, \\\"Kickstart My Heart\\\" de M\\u00f6tley Cr\\u00fce o \\\"Rock Rock (Till You Drop)\\\" de Def Leppard. Pero Eidos Montreal no se quiso conformar solo con esto y fue un paso m\\u00e1s all\\u00e1 para hacer algo realmente especial y \\u00fanico: grabar un \\u00e1lbum entero de much\\u00edsima calidad para un grupo de rock ficticio llamado Star-Lord que inspirar\\u00eda a Peter Quill a adoptar ese alias en la historia de la aventura. Sin duda, un juego que ser\\u00eda imposible de entender sin su m\\u00fasica.\\n\\nF-Zero X\\n\\nCada vez que nos toca escribir de F-Zero nos hacemos da\\u00f1o al recordar lo abandonad\\u00edsima que est\\u00e1 la saga por parte de Nintendo, pero no quer\\u00edamos pasar la oportunidad de incluir en este reportaje la banda sonora de F-Zero X, una de las mejores y m\\u00e1s ca\\u00f1eras que nos dej\\u00f3 Nintendo 64. No en vano, estamos hablando de una fant\\u00e1stica selecci\\u00f3n de temas repleta de guitarreos que captaban a la perfecci\\u00f3n la adrenalina desatada que supon\\u00eda pilotar naves antigravitatorias a m\\u00e1s de 1.000 kil\\u00f3metros por hora mientras compet\\u00edamos contra 29 rivales, elev\\u00e1ndonos el pulso hasta l\\u00edmites insospechados y regal\\u00e1ndonos melod\\u00edas que son ya todo un cl\\u00e1sico de la saga y que resulta imposible no acabar tarareando tras unas pocas partidas.\\n\\nTony Hawk\\u2019s Pro Skater 2\\n\\nElegir una \\u00fanica banda sonora de una saga como Tony Hawk\\u2019s no es precisamente f\\u00e1cil, dada la calidad que suelen atesorar con sus temas licenciados. Probablemente, muchos de vosotros os qued\\u00e9is con la de t\\u00edtulos como Tony Hawk\\u2019s Underground, una de las m\\u00e1s extensas de la serie y que m\\u00e1s nombres conocidos tiene, pero nosotros hemos decidido quedarnos con la de Tony Hawk\\u2019s Pro Skater 2 por su enorme importancia hist\\u00f3rica. Tanto es as\\u00ed que el \\u00e9xito de esta obra maestra de los juegos de skate dispar\\u00f3 la popularidad de un buen pu\\u00f1ado de grupos como Papa Roach o Millencollin, dej\\u00e1ndonos para el recuerdo una selecci\\u00f3n de temazos que hicieron que todas y cada una de nuestras partidas fuese toda una experiencia.\\n\\nHi-Fi Rush\\n\\nHi-Fi Rush se ha convertido en una de las grandes sorpresas de 2023. Un juego que Tango Gameworks hab\\u00eda guardado en secreto hasta que se anunci\\u00f3 y se lanz\\u00f3 el mismo d\\u00eda, pill\\u00e1ndonos a todos con la guardia baja con su incre\\u00edble calidad. Lo que recibimos fue un juego de acci\\u00f3n muy desenfadado, divertido y con much\\u00edsimo humor que convert\\u00eda la m\\u00fasica en el eje principal alrededor del que giraba todo, haci\\u00e9ndonos golpear, esquivar y realizar todo tipo de acciones al ritmo de su banda sonora. Una banda sonora que, por supuesto, ha hecho las delicias de los amantes del rock con canciones licenciadas de grupos como The Black Keys o Nine Inch Nails, aunque tampoco podemos restarle m\\u00e9ritos a sus composiciones originales, m\\u00e1s de 3 horas de temas de calidad compuestos para adaptarse a lo que ocurre en cada nivel, combate y situaci\\u00f3n de la aventura, creando as\\u00ed la fusi\\u00f3n perfecta entre m\\u00fasica y jugabilidad.\\n\\nBr\\u00fctal Legend\\n\\nHablar de Br\\u00fctal Legend es hacerlo del homenaje definitivo al heavy metal en forma de videojuego. La historia, la est\\u00e9tica, los personajes\\u2026 Todo desprende amor por este tipo de m\\u00fasica y la cultura que la rodea, y, como podr\\u00e9is suponer, su banda sonora no se qued\\u00f3 atr\\u00e1s. De hecho, a nivel musical es una aut\\u00e9ntica barbaridad, permiti\\u00e9ndonos disfrutar de una generosa selecci\\u00f3n de m\\u00e1s de 100 canciones en la que no falta la presencia de grandes iconos y abanderados del g\\u00e9nero como Judas Priest, Mot\\u00f6rhead, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, M\\u00f6tley Cr\\u00fce, Testament, KISS, In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, Megadeth, Def Leppard, Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson, Dragonforce y much\\u00edsimos m\\u00e1s. Sumadle que el propio juego, adem\\u00e1s de tener una propuesta jugable muy original y \\u00fanica, estaba genial y contaba con el mism\\u00edsimo Jack Black interpretando a su protagonista, y tendr\\u00e9is una obra imprescindible para cualquier amante del metal.\\n\\nDoom Eternal\\n\\nDoom es toda una leyenda de los videojuegos y aunque la saga estuvo un tiempo desaparecida en combate, volvi\\u00f3 con m\\u00e1s fuerza que nunca gracias a su entrega de 2016, un nuevo punto de partida con el que id Software convirti\\u00f3 el hecho de masacrar y despedazar demonios en todo un arte, algo que se llev\\u00f3 todav\\u00eda m\\u00e1s all\\u00e1 con su secuela, Doom Eternal. Pero si hay algo que podemos asegurar es que la acci\\u00f3n de estos juegos no ser\\u00eda igual de gratificante y satisfactoria sin su incre\\u00edble banda sonora, compuesta por Mick Gordon. Al ritmo del mejor exponente del metal industrial, los temazos que acompa\\u00f1aban los tiroteos eran capaces de subirnos la adrenalina a un nivel que muy pocos han llegado a alcanzar, consiguiendo que desat\\u00e1ramos nuestra bestia interior para dejarnos llevar por la brutalidad de sus combates mientras nos sumerg\\u00edamos en toda una sinfon\\u00eda de violencia, gore y v\\u00edsceras.Y todo ello por no hablar de la forma tan din\\u00e1mica en la que se comportaba para subir y bajar su intensidad seg\\u00fan lo que fuese ocurriendo. Si hemos escogido la secuela frente a su predecesor, es por el simple hecho de habernos ofrecido un m\\u00e1s y mejor en toda regla: m\\u00e1s canciones, m\\u00e1s fren\\u00e9ticas y con mayor pegada.\\n\\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance\\n\\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance es un juego que nunca est\\u00e1 m\\u00e1s de reivindicar. Al fin y al cabo, PlatinumGames nos deleit\\u00f3 con una fren\\u00e9tica y alocada aventura de acci\\u00f3n que cuenta con uno de los sistemas de parries m\\u00e1s satisfactorios que se han hecho nunca, algo a lo que debemos sumarle una puesta en escena que deja la boca abierta y unos jefes de los que marcan \\u00e9poca. De hecho, estos \\u00faltimos no ser\\u00edan lo mismo sin sus inolvidables temas vocales, los cuales confer\\u00edan una identidad muy marcada tanto a la batalla en s\\u00ed como al jefe en cuesti\\u00f3n. Todos ellos apostaban por una mezcla entre rock electr\\u00f3nico y metal que encajaba como un guante con el tono del juego, cumpliendo de sobra con su funci\\u00f3n de subirnos la adrenalina al m\\u00e1ximo al mismo tiempo que convert\\u00edan cada uno de estos duelos en una experiencia \\u00fanica y \\u00e9pica que jam\\u00e1s nos cansaremos de rejugar.\\n\\nKiller Instinct (2013)\\n\\nAunque no ha gozado de tanta popularidad como otros juegos de lucha, no se puede negar que el reinicio de Killer Instinct ha acabado por convertirse con el paso de los a\\u00f1os en una aut\\u00e9ntica maravilla que ning\\u00fan amante del g\\u00e9nero deber\\u00eda perderse. S\\u00ed, le llev\\u00f3 su tiempo alcanzar ese nivel, pero ahora mismo es una obra repleta de contenidos, espectacular, con un online de lujo y con una jugabilidad a prueba de bombas. Y s\\u00ed, es otro juego que le debe much\\u00edsimo a su banda sonora, uno de los mejores y m\\u00e1s variados trabajos de Mick Gordon, al menos durante sus dos primeras temporadas antes de que Celldweller y Atlas Plus tomaran el relevo con la tercera, con la cual se baj\\u00f3 ligeramente el list\\u00f3n.\\n\\nEn l\\u00edneas generales, estamos hablando de una banda sonora que juguetea con diferentes estilos, pero que suele tener el metal industrial muy presente para regalarnos unas composiciones absolutamente incre\\u00edbles que no solo destacan por lo extensas que son y su incuestionable calidad, sino tambi\\u00e9n por la forma en la que se comportan durante los enfrentamientos, aumentando su intensidad a medida que alargamos nuestros combos y reduci\\u00e9ndola cuando sufrimos un Combo Breaker, a\\u00f1adiendo incluso diferentes efectos que distorsionan el sonido seg\\u00fan lo requiera la situaci\\u00f3n. Os aseguramos que pocos juegos del g\\u00e9nero han conseguido que repartir guantazos sea una experiencia tan satisfactoria y no exageramos al decir que gran parte de la culpa de esto se la debemos a su m\\u00fasica.\\n\\nMetal: Hellsinger\\n\\nEn los \\u00faltimos a\\u00f1os se est\\u00e1n popularizando los juegos que combinan acci\\u00f3n y ritmo y uno de los mejores exponentes de esto lo tuvimos el a\\u00f1o pasado con el lanzamiento de Metal: Hellinger, un shooter en primera persona de sabor cl\\u00e1sico y con cierto regusto a las nuevas entregas de Doom que contaba con la peculiaridad de que deb\\u00edamos disparar, saltar, esquivar y movernos al ritmo de la canci\\u00f3n que sonase en cada nivel. Lo mejor era que si consegu\\u00edamos mantener el comp\\u00e1s y aumentar nuestro multiplicador de combos, el juego nos permit\\u00eda escuchar la parte vocal del tema en cuesti\\u00f3n, un incentivo excelente que consegu\\u00eda que quisi\\u00e9ramos jugar bien.\\n\\nSi decimos esto es porque a pesar de que la banda sonora es completamente original y fue compuesta en exclusiva para el t\\u00edtulo (la cual apuesta por el metal puro y duro), entre sus vocalistas nos encontr\\u00e1bamos a grandes estrellas de la talla de Serj Tankian (System of a Down), Matt Heafy (Trivium), Mikael Stanne (Dark Tranquillity), Randy Blythe (Lamb of God), Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy), Bj\\u00f6rn Strid (Soilwork) o Tatiana Shmailyuk (Jinjer). El resultado fue una banda sonora excepcional y de una calidad sobresaliente que hizo las delicias de cualquier amante del g\\u00e9nero, por lo que no pod\\u00eda faltar en esta lista.\\n\\nDevil May Cry 5\\n\\nDevil May Cry siempre ha sido una saga que ha destacado, adem\\u00e1s de por la calidad de su acci\\u00f3n, por sus bandas sonoras, capaces de adaptarse de maravilla a todo lo que vemos en pantalla para dispararnos la adrenalina al combatir con temas muy ca\\u00f1eros en los que el metal y el rock se llegan a combinar con otros g\\u00e9neros, algo que ha alcanzado su m\\u00e1xima expresi\\u00f3n con su quinta entrega numerada, un t\\u00edtulo que nos ha dejado para el recuerdo con algunas composiciones que han causado aut\\u00e9ntico furor, como \\\"Devil Trigger\\\" o \\\"Bury the Light\\\". Y al igual que otros t\\u00edtulos de esta lista, los temas de combate se comportaban de forma din\\u00e1mica, aumentando su intensidad a medida que increment\\u00e1bamos nuestro rango a base de realizar combos con estilo, un detalle que puede parecer simple pero que estaba espectacularmente ejecutado y que consegu\\u00eda que nos vini\\u00e9semos arriba al jugar bien. No hay muchas bandas sonoras capaces de servir como premio al jugador por su buen desempe\\u00f1o durante la partida, pero esta es, sin duda, una de ellas.\\n\\nGuilty Gear: Strive\\n\\nGuilty Gear es una saga que nunca ha escondido sus fuertes inspiraciones en el metal y el rock, con personajes que incluso deben sus nombres a grandes artistas, as\\u00ed que a nadie deber\\u00eda sorprender que este siempre haya sido el estilo musical que ha predominado en una serie que tiene ya un largo recorrido y una gran selecci\\u00f3n de temazos ic\\u00f3nicos. Sin embargo, en vez de escoger sus entregas cl\\u00e1sicas, hemos querido quedarnos con su juego m\\u00e1s reciente, Guilty Gear: Strive, para el cual Daisuke Ishiwatari nos ha deleitado los o\\u00eddos con una gran cantidad de temas vocales de lo m\\u00e1s ca\\u00f1eros que captan a la perfecci\\u00f3n la esencia de la serie y elevan el frenetismo y la intensidad habitual de sus batallas al siguiente nivel. Un trabajo impecable del que resulta imposible cansarse.\\n\\nLollipop Chainsaw\\n\\nQuiz\\u00e1 no sea el juego que esperabais encontrar en esta lista, pero hemos decidido incluirlo por su espectacular mezcla de temas licenciados y m\\u00fasica original. Por una parte, tenemos temazos de la talla de \\\"Nemesis\\\" de Arch Enemy o \\\"Heroes of Our Time\\\" de Dragonforce, mientras que por el otro Akira Yamaoka (el compositor habitual de Silent Hill) nos hace disfrutar con su particular estilo y forma de interpretar el rock con una serie de composiciones de la m\\u00e1s alta calidad que tienen su sello impreso, dej\\u00e1ndonos para el recuerdo una banda sonora impecable, muy bien escogida y con un uso magistral que dota de much\\u00edsima personalidad a cada una de las secciones del juego. Vale, s\\u00ed, cuenta con m\\u00e1s estilos, como el funk o el punk, pero cuando abraza el rock y el metal, brilla como ella sola.\\n\\nOtras menciones destacadas\\n\\nAl hablar de m\\u00fasica es imposible contentar a todo el mundo, ya que todos tenemos nuestros propios gustos y no es viable reducir a tan solo 13 juegos un legado musical tan extenso como el que nos ha dejado este hobby que tanto amamos, por eso vamos a intentar a\\u00f1adir algunas menciones destacadas para que la representaci\\u00f3n sea mayor.\\n\\nDe entrada, no podemos olvidarnos del remake de 2010 de Splatterhouse, un juego que dej\\u00f3 much\\u00edsimo que desear pero que hac\\u00eda gala de una banda sonora realmente buena que inclu\\u00eda temas de grupos como Lamb of God y Municipal Waste. Otro caso parecido lo tendr\\u00edamos en KISS: Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child, un mediocre t\\u00edtulo de acci\\u00f3n en primera persona abanderado por KISS, por lo que su banda sonora, desde luego, no fall\\u00f3.\\n\\nPor supuesto, dentro de los juegos musicales, tenemos que hacer una menci\\u00f3n obligatoria a Rock Band, la saga que le plant\\u00f3 cara a Guitar Hero con una serie de entregas que hicieron gala de una selecci\\u00f3n de temas licenciados potent\\u00edsimos donde no faltaron grupos de la talla de Metallica o Iron Maiden.\\n\\nLa serie Twisted Metal es otra que nos ha dejado buenas bandas sonoras marcadas por el metal, y la primera entrega de Quake tuvo su banda sonora compuesta por m\\u00e1s ni menos que Trent Reznor de Nine Inch Nails, dej\\u00e1ndonos para el recuerdo un tema principal muy ca\\u00f1ero e ic\\u00f3nico y unas composiciones que creaban un ambiente espeluznante.\\n\\nLas entregas 3D de Sonic tampoco son ajenas al rock y nos han dejado temazos muy memorables donde destacan especialmente los compuestos e interpretados por Crush 40, y Remedy es un estudio que suele colaborar con Poets of the Fall y que tiene juegos con niveles que giran en torno a alguno de sus temas, tal y como demostr\\u00f3 hace no mucho Control en su recta final.\\n\\nDe tem\\u00e1tica 100% metal hay ejemplos destacables como Slain: Back From Hell y Valfaris, y hay juego que cuentan en su haber con temas memorables de rock a pesar de no ser el estilo predominante de sus bandas sonoras, como bien demuestran t\\u00edtulos como Halo 2 y su m\\u00edtico \\\"Blow Me Away\\\". El g\\u00e9nero tambi\\u00e9n suele estar muy presente en los juegos de conducci\\u00f3n, por lo que tambi\\u00e9n podr\\u00edamos se\\u00f1alar sagas como Forza Horizon, Gran Turismo, Burnout o Need for Speed, aunque son bandas sonoras con una variedad de estilos muy amplia.\\n\\nPodr\\u00edamos seguir y seguir, pero llegados a este punto creemos que lo mejor es que nos dig\\u00e1is vosotros en los comentarios cu\\u00e1les son vuestras bandas sonoras y temas favoritos tanto de rock como de metal que hab\\u00e9is escuchado en un videojuego, as\\u00ed como aquellas menciones que hab\\u00e9is echado de menos. \\u00a1Os leemos!\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Siliconera\", \"author\": \"Jenni Lada\", \"title\": \"Guilty Gear Plush and Bridget Nendoroid Revealed\", \"description\": \"At Anime Expo 2023, Good Smile Company showed off the Guilty Gear Bridget Nendoroid and new plush of Baiken, Sol Badguy, Jack-O, and Ky Kiske.

Nestled high up in the mountains is Camp Damascus, the self-proclaimed \\u201cmost effective\\u201d gay conversion camp in the country. Here, a life free from sin awaits. But the secret behind that success is anything but holy. And they\\u2019ll scare you straight to hell.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019ve got no shadow,\\u201d Martina informs me, gazing down at my feet and then shifting her eyes back up to mine.\\n\\nI check, and sure enough my friend is largely correct. Thanks to the afternoon sun hanging directly overhead, it appears my shadow has mostly disappeared. It\\u2019s a subtle observation, a phenomenon you\\u2019d never really notice unless you were looking for it, and yet Martina has pointed it out with an excited grin.\\n\\nOf course, closer examination would reveal that my shadow, while small, is still there. Hawai\\u2019i is the only state where your shadows do completely disappear, and this rare event only happens twice a year. It\\u2019s called Lahaina Noon.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t say this, though.\\n\\nI think to ask why Martina is so excited about her flawed discovery, one that immediately falls apart after the slightest direct inspection, but I quickly realize I don\\u2019t have to. I too notice the little things Martina does, logging every tiny quirk of the world regardless of anyone else finding them worthy of comment. There are so many beautiful pieces in God\\u2019s grand puzzle, and they can pass you by if you\\u2019re not careful.\\n\\n\\u201cYeah, I guess you\\u2019re right,\\u201d I offer.\\n\\n\\u201cLike Peter Pan,\\u201d Martina continues, the smile curling wider across her overwhelmingly freckled face.\\n\\nWith anyone else, this unhinged friendliness might signal a touch of sarcasm lurking somewhere behind Martina\\u2019s large green eyes, but I know better. At least, I hope I do.\\n\\nI nod along, smiling happily despite suddenly finding myself in the pop culture deep end with little understanding of what she\\u2019s talking about. I\\u2019ve never read the book, nor seen any films related to this antique story with questionable motives. There\\u2019s enchantment involved, so I know enough to stay far, far away.\\n\\nFor a brief moment I consider telling Martina she shouldn\\u2019t read that stuff, that the only magic she needs is the love of Christ, but I hesitate.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve had these conversations before, and even in a town as God-fearing as Neverton, there\\u2019s only so many who want to hear it. Most Christian folks are friendly enough, but the second you start rubbing their faces in these little indiscretions they bristle.\\n\\nThe last thing I want to do is make Martina bristle.\\n\\n\\u201cDid you have to read that Freshman year?\\u201d she questions, clearly noting the pained expression on my face I\\u2019m so desperately struggling to avoid.\\n\\nI shake my head. \\u201cNo,\\u201d I reply flatly, rejecting explanation.\\n\\nThe truth is, I do remember Peter Pan being assigned in English class, and I remember the reports that accompanied this classic secular tale from James Matthew Barrie. I could easily tell you where the author was born (Scotland), how he died (pneumonia), or even let you in on the fact he killed off an equally profane and godless character, Sherlock Holmes, in a non-canon short story well before Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever had the chance.\\n\\nThese facts about the author create a window into his work, not a door. It\\u2019s a window I\\u2019ve never crawled through.\\n\\nIntentionally.\\n\\n\\u201cWeren\\u2019t you in my class?\\u201d Martina continues. \\u201cI thought everyone read it.\\u201d\\n\\nOnce again, I\\u2019m put to the test, reaching the familiar crossroads of how forthcoming I think I should be.\\n\\nI love Jesus, I really do, but Jesus would want me to be cool. He\\u2019d want Martina to think I was cool.\\n\\nKingdom of The Pine was founded on a tenet of practicality, after all.\\n\\nWhich brings me back to this conversation, and the sudden realization I\\u2019ve been standing in silence for way too long. I need an answer that will appease both a fellow student and the good Lord above, struggling to walk the razor\\u2019s edge between the truth of my deeply held convictions and the relaxed sheen of a perfectly normal girl.\\n\\nNot all Kingdom Kids are weird.\\n\\n\\u201cI didn\\u2019t think\\u2026 I mean\\u2026\\u201d I stammer, struggling to craft an excuse and coming up short as my mind tumbles and churns. \\u201cMy parents didn\\u2019t want me reading it,\\u201d I finally reply, submitting the truth and letting the chips fall where they may. \\u201cMagic, you know?\\u201d\\n\\nMartina\\u2019s already enormous green eyes widen in a visage of complete shock. \\u201cWait, really?\\u201d she blurts.\\n\\nMy friend\\u2019s expression is not what I expected, flooded by sudden excitement and genuine interest. I now realize she might be impressed by this moral objection, and my mind begins to race as I wonder if she\\u2019s proud of me.\\n\\nWell, not prideful but\\u2026 something like that.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve known Martina for a very long time, although we\\u2019ve only recently started talking in a meaningful way. Could she have similar convictions? Could this be the start of the deep, authentic friendship I\\u2019ve been hoping for?\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s fucked up,\\u201d Martina finally continues, immediately prompting me to pump the proverbial brakes on my enthusiasm. \\u201cThat\\u2019s way fucked up, Rose. I\\u2019m sorry your parents are so crazy.\\u201d\\n\\nI can\\u2019t help nodding along, the muscles of my neck taking on a life of their own.\\n\\n\\u201cYeah,\\u201d I reply, rolling my eyes. \\u201cWay\\u2026 messed up. Parents, right?\\u201d\\n\\nThe second these words leave my lips I feel the deep ache of regret, a guilty pang that shoots down my spine as a sinful reminder. God\\u2019s watchful eye has noticed.\\n\\nMartina smiles, though, and suddenly this regret is met with something else, a surge of joy that counteracts the holy venom like ANAVIP though the bloodstream of some poor soul who crossed a Pentecostal pit viper.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve gotta pull back on the snake handling.\\n\\n\\u201cAlright. See you at the bottom,\\u201d Martina continues.\\n\\nMy friend promptly turns and breaks into a run, sprinting with her bare feet across the short, rocky runway. It\\u2019s as though the frozen universe has started rolling on again, the rustle of the trees and the splash of water far, far below filling my ears.\\n\\nThe other kids who\\u2019ve gathered around these cliffs watch in amazement, their hair wet and stringy as towels drape across them for a fleeting moment of dryness before the next brave leap. Everyone here is used to jumpers taking their time for a big show, standing at the edge of the cliff for a good while and gazing down as though considering their surrender. Of course, once they\\u2019ve gotten to the rocky ledge they rarely back down, and everyone watching knows this. It\\u2019s all part of the performance, a temporary ringmaster gathering as many eyes as possible before rushing to the edge and hurling themselves over. They tumble down into the cool water below with a mighty splash, followed by excited cheers from their brief but adoring fans.\\n\\nMartina doesn\\u2019t need any of that.\\n\\n\\u201cFuck!\\u201d she cries out as she springs from the rocks, her body rocketing forward while arms and legs continue pumping in the air. I can see the exact point that gravity catches hold of her body, gripping tight and then yanking downward in a sharp change of trajectory that would make Newton proud.\\n\\nI lose sight of Martina\\u2019s long strawberry curls as she drops, but I\\u2019m too frightened to rush to the edge and witness her plummet. Seconds after disappearing from view there\\u2019s a loud splash, followed by a joyful eruption from the crowd. Their applause carries out through the forest around us, washing through the trees like audible water.\\n\\nCarefully, I creep to the edge and stare down into the swimming hole that lies below, the dark water still rippling from Martina\\u2019s plunge. A few sunbathers lay out on the shore nearby in various states of undress, many of them less covered up than I\\u2019m comfortable with, and a handful of swimmers float at the outer rim of this dazzling natural pool.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a hot day in Montana, so the falls are packed.\\n\\nI continue gazing, waiting for Martina to resurface as my heart rate needlessly quickens. She\\u2019s done this jump hundreds of times, and it appears none of them have resulted in disaster so far. There\\u2019s no logical reason for Martina to have any trouble this time around, but as I stare down at the reflective surface below, I can\\u2019t help the tiny seed of fear that blossoms at the pit of my stomach.\\n\\nFor some reason I\\u2019ve found myself caring a lot about how things turn out for her. It feels, in a word, weird.\\n\\nThankfully, a wave of relief pulses through my body as Martina breaks the surface, taking in a big gulp of air and instinctively whipping her red hair from side to side. She begins swimming gracefully across the water, making her way to the shore.\\n\\nFrom up here I can see her body move in a completely new light, propelling herself forward with majestic elegance. She looks like a frog as she kicks her legs, but that comparison sounds brash and awkward, while Martina is nothing of the sort.\\n\\n\\u201cYou gonna give it a shot?\\u201d a voice abruptly questions from behind, breaking my focus and causing a startled breath to catch in my throat.\\n\\nI turn around to find my friend Seth, his shirtless body already deeply tanned in the afternoon sun. His hair is still wet from the last leap, and I have no doubt he\\u2019d love to make another running launch off this cliffside. However, Seth has taken a moment away from his own madcap antics to nurture my growth as a future daredevil.\\n\\n\\u201cI was thinking about it,\\u201d I admit.\\n\\nSeth cracks a smile. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not as hard as it looks. I mean, we\\u2019re only thirty feet up. You\\u2019re not gonna die.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cPeople died while jumping here in 1977, 1980, and 2016,\\u201d I inform him. \\u201cSo\\u2026 it\\u2019s possible.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh,\\u201d Seth replies, his enthusiasm abruptly deflating. He narrows his eyes as a confused expression crosses his face, suddenly faced with this unexpected kernel of self-doubt.\\n\\nThe average speed of a dive is 15 feet per second. Therefore, a swimming hole between 10 and 15 feet deep could paralyze you in less than a second.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t mention this.\\n\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re still not going to die,\\u201d I assure him. \\u201cThe chances of fatal injury are phenomenally low. If you want to increase your survival odds, just make sure you jump feet first. Never dive.\\u201d\\n\\nSeth nods along as I pull him back into mental alignment.\\n\\n\\u201cPlus, God\\u2019s watching over you,\\u201d I continue.\\n\\nSeth smiles a toothy, all-American grin. My friend reaches out and places a hand on my shoulder in a gesture of reassurance, but lingers there a little longer than I might\\u2019ve expected. \\u201cAmen.\\u201d\\n\\nFinally, I let out an awkward laugh and my friend removes his hand.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s see it then,\\u201d Seth continues, nodding toward the cliff\\u2019s edge. \\u201cWhat you got, Rose?\\u201d\\n\\nSeth backs away and motions for the other kids up here to clear a path. They\\u2019re waiting and watching now, their eyes trained on me in anticipation of the leap to come.\\n\\nNine out of ten accidents occur when people are playing near the water\\u2019s edge, not when they\\u2019re focused on jumping in.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve got this.\\n\\nI pull off my long dress and toss it to the side, revealing the most decidedly modest, black one-piece I could find online. Unlike Martina, however, I\\u2019m not yet comfortable enough to flip myself into oblivion without a good look below.\\n\\nI know I\\u2019ll be fine, that most of the danger here is nothing but an illusion, but my brain understanding this is one thing and my body appropriately reacting is another. My heart is slamming hard within my chest, thundering away as a sizzling hot tingle makes its way across my skin.\\n\\nThis is your fight or flight response. Your sympathetic nervous system is releasing catecholamines and making you hyper aware of your surroundings.\\n\\nThe solution, of course, is grounding and prayer.\\n\\nI spend a moment observing the scene around me, taking in faces on every side of the watering hole. Across the way, on the opposite cliff, even more of my peers watch with excitement and anticipation.\\n\\nThe Lord is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?\\n\\nSome people come here to jump, others just wanna be a part of something. As the school year comes to an end and we all prepare to leap from our own metaphorical cliffs into adulthood, it\\u2019s easy to get restless. We\\u2019re all pretending it\\u2019s mid-summer and we\\u2019re finally free, despite the fact that tomorrow we\\u2019ll be right back to the Monday grind.\\n\\nI get the distinct feeling I\\u2019m living in what will someday be a fond memory.\\n\\nWith that, I command my foot to take its first step toward the edge.\\n\\nMy body refuses to move.\\n\\n\\u201cThe Lord is my light and my salvation,\\u201d I repeat. I take a deep breath and center myself once more, focused on compelling my body forward.\\n\\nStill, nothing.\\n\\nI remain motionless, staring out at a sea of classmates on the opposite cliffside while they gaze back at this curious standoff between mind and body.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not so bad once you start running,\\u201d Seth says from behind. \\u201cOnce you reach the edge, the hard part is over.\\u201d\\n\\nHis words are kind, and I appreciate this vote of confidence, but in a practical sense it does absolutely nothing. I\\u2019m displaying textbook freezing behavior, and Seth has no more control over my basolateral amygdala than I do.\\n\\nSuddenly, another familiar voice chimes in, hooting like a baseball coach from the dugout. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go, Rose!\\u201d\\n\\nI glance over to find Martina has already climbed back up, soaking wet with a towel wrapped tight around her body. Our eyes meet and she smiles warmly, immediately melting away the anxiety and fear that had paralyzed me with its icy grip. She winks.\\n\\nI grin back, basking in this feeling for a moment, then return my focus to the cliff.\\n\\nFeeling renewed, I prepare a third attempt at compelling myself forward, but before I get the chance my gaze falls onto something strange across the ravine. The other side of the cliffs is fairly close, some 40 feet across with a small waterfall carving its way down the middle in a never-ending cascade. Fellow classmates in their colorful swimwear line the opposite edge, but tucked back into the forest is another figure that watches with stoic intensity.\\n\\nI squint a bit, struggling to parse whether my eyes are playing tricks on me through the shady wood.\\n\\nA frighteningly pale woman is standing in the forest, her hair long and black as it hangs limply over her face and around her boney shoulders. It appears she\\u2019s staring directly at me, but it\\u2019s difficult to tell because her eyes lack irises or pupils. They\\u2019re solid white globes.\\n\\nThe woman is smiling, her expression frozen and her teeth unusually stained with dark brown and black smears. The incisors themselves are crooked and long, as though her gums have receded to provide an unnatural length.\\n\\nYet, despite all of this, the strangest thing about the woman\\u2019s appearance is what she\\u2019s wearing. She sports a deep red polo shirt with a stark white name tag pinned to the chest. It\\u2019s the kind of top you\\u2019d expect to see worn by someone arriving to fix your wireless internet or telling you which aisle to check at a department store. She also wears a thick metal band around her neck, which is pulled tight like a collar.\\n\\n\\u201cUh\\u2026 do you see that?\\u201d I question, whispering to Seth as my gaze remains fixed on the woman in the woods.\\n\\nAcross the way, nobody seems to notice this peculiar figure, despite the fact that she\\u2019s standing no more than 10 feet behind them in the underbrush.\\n\\n\\u201cSee what?\\u201d Seth asks.\\n\\nI point to the other side of the swimming hole, but just as Seth follows my gesture the eerie woman steps back into the lush Montana forest, disappearing just as quickly as she arrived.\\n\\nI peer into the shadows, struggling to catch sight of her but coming up empty.\\n\\n\\u201cThere was a woman over there,\\u201d I continue. \\u201cShe looked\\u2026 kinda off.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOff how?\\u201d Seth counters.\\n\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d I reply, then shake my head as though this futile gesture might clear out the cobwebs. I certainly don\\u2019t intend to make a scene out of some poor old woman who happens to appear, well, frightening.\\n\\nMaybe she\\u2019s sick.\\n\\n\\u201cCould\\u2019ve been someone\\u2019s mom checking in on them,\\u201d I suggest, offering this explanation more to myself than to Seth.\\n\\n\\u201cI really don\\u2019t see anything,\\u201d he says, genuinely apologetic, then lowers his voice a bit. \\u201cHey, if you don\\u2019t wanna jump, it\\u2019s all good.\\u201d\\n\\nSomeone else steps up next to us, a girl I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s anxious to get things going again. \\u201cAre you gonna jump?\\u201d she questions, deeply annoyed.\\n\\nI glance around to find a line has formed behind me, folks waiting their turn while I stare off into space and let my imagination run wild.\\n\\n\\u201cOh, sorry,\\u201d I stammer, stepping back.\\n\\nMartina isn\\u2019t as receptive. \\u201cChill out, she\\u2019s getting ready,\\u201d my friend retorts angrily from the sideline.\\n\\nIt takes a moment for me to regain focus, but soon enough I\\u2019m returning to my former position and following Martina\\u2019s lead.\\n\\nI push away any thoughts of that curious lady in the woods, or the height of this drop, or the fact that school is ending and life is waiting for me with wide open jaws like the whale ready to swallow Jonah whole. Instead, I focus on the simple act of putting one foot before the next.\\n\\nI take one final look at Martina, just about ready to step forward when something startling and warm slips between my fingers.\\n\\nGlancing down, I find that Seth is gripping my hand in his, an unexpected gesture of friendship.\\n\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019ll jump together,\\u201d Seth offers.\\n\\nI was about to go on my own, but a little more support couldn\\u2019t hurt.\\n\\nA strange coo falls from the lips of everyone watching, a sound I\\u2019m not quite sure what to make of as expressions shift into knowing smiles and glances are exchanged across this cliffside and the next.\\n\\nI begin to recite a short verse under my breath, repeating it to myself over and over again in quiet anticipation. \\u201cIt is the Lord who marches before you; he will be with you and will never fail you. It is the Lord who marches before you; he will be with you and will never fail you.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cGo on three,\\u201d Seth proclaims. \\u201cOne. Two. Three!\\u201d\\n\\nWe take off down the short runway, our feet thundering against the dirt until there\\u2019s no ground left to slam against. I push off with my final step and erupt into the air, unable to keep myself from crying out with a long scream of equal parts fear and excitement.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s a few precious moments of high school left, but this one feels like the pinnacle of summer.\\n\\nAn electric tingle surges across my frame as gravity catches hold, Seth and I plummeting toward the deep blue below. It\\u2019s a strange sensation that my brain immediately struggles to analyze and dissect, but before I get the chance to understand it fully I\\u2019m slamming into the cool water.\\n\\nMy senses are swallowed by darkness, the sound of the world around me sucking inward and holding tight as I struggle to find my bearings. I\\u2019m still plummeting, just slower now, and for a brief moment my feet touch the welcome clay of the riverbed below. I push back against the bottom and swim up in a cascade of tiny bubbles, finally breaking the surface once again.\\n\\nThe resulting rush is incredible, my body fresh and rejuvenated in a way that I didn\\u2019t quite expect.\\n\\nThat was my first jump ever; a welcome baptism.\\n\\nI run fingers through my long blonde hair, pushing it away from my face as I spit out some of the water that managed to force its way down my throat. As I sputter and cough, Seth emerges next to me in the dark pool.\\n\\n\\u201cYou alright, Rose?\\u201d he asks, chuckling as he watches me awkwardly pull myself together.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m amazing,\\u201d I reply. \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe I just did that! God is good!\\u201d\\n\\nSeth is unable to keep himself from smiling even wider as we tread water next to one another, savoring the unexpected calm that\\u2019s preceded such a gaudy stunt.\\n\\nSilence falls, bathing the scene in an awkward hush.\\n\\nI was so relaxed and now this is tense. Why is this tense?\\n\\nFinally, I just can\\u2019t take it anymore. I splash some water in Seth\\u2019s face and let the tension deflate with a good-hearted laugh.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m going again,\\u201d I announce before slipping below the surface and swimming toward the rocky shore nearby.\\n\\n***\\n\\nAs we drive home in Seth\\u2019s old Jeep, I can\\u2019t help but notice the way his eyes dance across the heating panel of his center console, focused on a lever that sits precariously shifted to the blazing hot side. I get the feeling Seth is struggling to tell me something \\u2013 or maybe he wants me to ask something of him? \\u2013 but he\\u2019s too afraid.\\n\\nTruth be told, this is becoming a theme with Seth, and I just can\\u2019t figure out why. We\\u2019ve been close for a long time, and I\\u2019ve always appreciated the way he\\u2019s there for me through thick and thin, a reliable shoulder to cry on and a source of great Christian companionship on these long days.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d I finally ask.\\n\\nSeth plays dumb, glancing over from the driver\\u2019s seat as his vehicle rumbles onward. The trees of the forest have finally started giving way, revealing the modest suburban homes of Neverton.\\n\\nTucked against the side of a horseshoe-shaped mountain range, these foothills feel distinctly separate from the rest of the world. While a vast landscape of rolling golden farmlands extend to the east, the majority of this county is swathed in mysterious, evergreen forest, hiding our hamlet like a secret as looming peaks rise beyond.\\n\\nI recognize every intricate step of this route, the signs and sidewalks etched into the depths of my soul. It\\u2019s a humble Montana town of 15,000 locals, so finding your way around isn\\u2019t much of an accomplishment, but it certainly makes you notice when your driver isn\\u2019t paying attention.\\n\\n\\u201cThat was the turn,\\u201d I remind him, charting a route we\\u2019d traveled a thousand times before. \\u201cJust get the next one.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cSorry,\\u201d Seth apologizes, shaking his head and wiping his brow. He glances at the heater once again. \\u201cYou sure you want it that warm?\\u201d\\n\\nI notice now that he\\u2019s getting a little red, sweating as the car continues to fill with hot air.\\n\\n\\u201cAre you feeling okay?\\u201d I ask.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s\\u2026 really hot in here,\\u201d Seth finally cuts to the chase. \\u201cDo you mind if I turn the heat down?\\u201d\\n\\nI nod.\\n\\nLately, it feels as though I can\\u2019t warm up for the life of me, trapped in a state of frigid discomfort for hours at a time. It comes without warning, and the curious part of my mind wonders if this might be a symptom of a larger medical issue.\\n\\nIt hasn\\u2019t been worth bringing up with my parents yet, because by the time I\\u2019m irritated enough to do something about this sensation the chill has thawed.\\n\\nI say nothing as Seth adjusts the temperature slightly. He furrows his brow a bit, confused. \\u201cNow I\\u2019m cold,\\u201d he announces with a chuckle.\\n\\nMy teeth are starting to chatter, but I remain silent as I place my backpack over my lap to retain a morsel of heat.\\n\\n\\u201cLong day, huh?\\u201d Seth continues, giving the temperature adjustment a rest.\\n\\nI nod, gazing out the window as a slate of familiar faces pass us by. I recognize most of the folks strolling around this evening; joyful, God-fearing families out for brisk walks as they enjoy a flourishing purple sunset above.\\n\\n\\u201cI really like spending time with you,\\u201d Seth declares.\\n\\nI glance back at my friend, appreciating the sincerity of his words. \\u201cThanks. You too.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cYou too?\\u201d he repeats back, as if my reply needs more explanation.\\n\\n\\u201cI really like spending time with you, too,\\u201d I clarify. \\u201cYou\\u2019re a good friend.\\u201d\\n\\nSeth appears confused by my response, but I don\\u2019t know what else he wants from me. I\\u2019d love to dive deep and figure out what\\u2019s going on with him, but right now I\\u2019m partially distracted by just how ravenously hungry I\\u2019ve become. Seth wasn\\u2019t kidding when he mentioned the length of the day, and after five or six cliff jumps and subsequent climbs back to the top, I\\u2019ve found myself yearning for the sweet relief of fat and sugar in my bloodstream.\\n\\nThankfully, Mom and Dad assured me dinner would be waiting when I got home.\\n\\nWe ride in silence a while longer before Seth reaches out and readjusts the heater, pushing forth the warm air once again and bending to my wishes.\\n\\n\\u201cThanks,\\u201d I chuckle graciously.\\n\\n\\u201cNo problem,\\u201d Seth replies, strangely taciturn.\\n\\nEventually, Seth pulls up to my house, his Jeep turning into the gravel driveway and slowly rolling to a stop with a satisfying crunch.\\n\\n\\u201cThank you for driving,\\u201d I offer, anxious to get inside for dinner.\\n\\nI throw off my seatbelt and double-check that my backpack and towel are in tow. Swiftly, I throw open the vehicle door and offer a slight wave goodbye before hopping out and slamming it shut behind me, then hurry up the front walk.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve only make it a few steps before another loud metallic slam answers my own. Curious, I turn and discover Seth has climbed from the driver\\u2019s seat and is marching after me.\\n\\n\\u201cRose!\\u201d he calls out.\\n\\nI wait up, and soon enough we are standing face-to-face. There\\u2019s an intensity to his gaze, a tidal wave of emotion welling up within my friend. I can sense the impending cascade of feelings, but it\\u2019s shape and tone remain abstract.\\n\\nI have no idea what Seth could possibly want.\\n\\nMy friend doesn\\u2019t say a word, just stares at me blankly as unknown thoughts spiral through his mind. I\\u2019ve seen this expression a lot lately, but today it has grown to a boiling point and, to be perfectly frank, it\\u2019s starting to frighten me.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d I demand.\\n\\nSeth leans forward and kisses me on the lips, a swift movement that\\u2019s met with my immediate repulsion.\\n\\nI pull my neck away in alarm and confusion as our faces briefly meet and then quickly part. My mind is struggling to keep up, desperately piecing together what just happened.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d I blurt. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t\\u2026 that was\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cOh, I-I thought\\u2013 \\u201d Seth stammers.\\n\\nGradually, the true nature of this moment falls into place with breathtaking clarity.\\n\\nI shake my head, my lips tightly sealed as I let this gesture do the talking.\\n\\n\\u201cSo, you\\u2019re not\\u2026?\\u201d Seth is still having trouble completing a sentence.\\n\\n\\u201cDefinitely not,\\u201d I reply.\\n\\n\\u201cBut, I thought,\\u201d he repeats, a surprisingly meek moment for this typically stalwart guy.\\n\\n\\u201cNope,\\u201d I say, as my head continues to shake from side to side.\\n\\nSeth takes a moment to straighten up, processing this information in a state of awkward rigidity. I can tell he\\u2019s fighting some powerful internal battle, struggling to calm down.\\n\\nSuddenly, he turns and begins the march back to his car. Before making his way around to the driver\\u2019s side, however, Seth erupts in a startling display of violence as he punches the passenger door.\\n\\nI jump as the Jeep makes a hollow metallic thump, startled at first and then concerned for Seth\\u2019s hand.\\n\\nThat probably hurt.\\n\\nSeth doesn\\u2019t react to the pain. Instead, he stomps around the vehicle and climbs inside, slamming the door behind him. He starts his car and hits the gas, peeling onto the road in reverse and scattering gravel everywhere.\\n\\nI watch in silence, still not sure how to react as Seth\\u2019s Jeep disappears down the road.\\n\\nEventually, the front door opens behind me and my father sticks his head out, his chiseled jaw and familiar black-framed glasses shadowed in the dying light of day.\\n\\n\\u201cWas that Seth?\\u201d he calls out. \\u201cYou should\\u2019ve asked him to stay for dinner.\\u201d\\n\\nSeconds later, my father realizes the porch light is off and makes an awkward humph sound that it seems only dads are capable of. He quickly flips a switch, illuminating the scene.\\n\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s my girl,\\u201d he says.\\n\\nI solemnly retreat to my father, still completely silent as I wrap my arms around him in a warm embrace. We stand like this for a moment, allowing his protective paternal aura to envelope me, then I finally pull back as my stomach gurgles.\\n\\nI can already smell the garlic spaghetti sauce as it bubbles and churns on our kitchen stove, thrilled my mom opted for pasta this evening.\\n\\nMy father, Luke Darling, is a kind-eyed man with dark features and thick glasses that make him look like Superman. Of course, just like Peter Pan, I\\u2019ve never actually read a Superman comic, but the cultural relevance of this secular hero has somehow permeated my life.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s concerning. Jesus Christ is the only true superhero.\\n\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m so hungry,\\u201d I announce.\\n\\n\\u201cHi, So Hungry. I\\u2019m Dad\\u201d my father retorts, prompting a playful groan to escape my throat.\\n\\nWe head inside and I immediately find myself bathed in spiritual warmth, a cozy sensation that fills the pit of my stomach and causes the ice in my veins to melt away. That cold, lingering chill has finally taken its leave, disappearing with such little fanfare I hardly remember it was there in the first place.\\n\\nMy mother, Lisa, greets me in the kitchen with a loud and excited wail. \\u201cRose!\\u201d she cries out as though I\\u2019ve been gone for years, a sauce-covered wooden spoon gripped tight in her hand. \\u201cMy baby is back!\\u201d\\n\\nMom wraps her arms around me and plants a firm kiss on my cheek. When she pulls away, she immediately motions to the dining room table, coaxing me toward my place setting at the end.\\n\\n\\u201cHope you\\u2019re hungry,\\u201d she continues. \\u201cI made spaghetti.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cI can smell that,\\u201d I reply warmly, \\u201cwith extra garlic.\\u201d\\n\\nMy parents exchange excited glances, thrilled by this culinary transgression. We\\u2019re being bad tonight.\\n\\nMom is always well put together, but this evening she\\u2019s looking especially done up with a lime green dress and a string of pearls around her neck. If the church allowed her to sport earrings there\\u2019s no doubt she\\u2019d have massive stones in either lobe.\\n\\nEven Mom\\u2019s makeup is less subtle than usual, a little extra red in the tone of her lips that she wouldn\\u2019t dare try if we were leaving the house this evening, and her stark blonde hair is held back with a white band across the top of her head. She\\u2019s a small woman but full of energy, and tonight her natural beauty is on full display.\\n\\nPeople say we look alike, and right now I can truly appreciate what a compliment that is.\\n\\nI take my seat at the end of the table while my mother continues to move back and forth across the kitchen, hard at work as she guides this meal across the finish line with radiant enthusiasm.\\n\\nEventually, my father makes his way over and sits down next to me, a peculiar look in his eye. He\\u2019s staring like he\\u2019s got something to say, an amused smirk just barely visible at the corners of his mouth.\\n\\n\\u201cWhat?\\u201d I question.\\n\\n\\u201cI see the light of the Lord in you tonight,\\u201d my father informs me, a compliment I\\u2019d take to heart if not for the fact this loving message feels tethered to something I don\\u2019t understand.\\n\\nSeconds later, mom is setting down an enormous dish of spaghetti before us, steam rolling off the bright red sauce as it floods our nostrils with robust aroma.\\n\\n\\u201cLuke!\\u201d my mother blurts playfully. \\u201cGive her a moment!\\u201d\\n\\nMy dad smiles and leans back in his chair, still eyeing me mischievously.\\n\\n\\u201cOkay, what\\u2019s going on here?\\u201d I glance back and forth between them as my mother takes her seat.\\n\\nMy query goes ignored as our conversation takes a sudden intermission, Luke and Lisa reaching their hands out to take my palms in theirs as we lower or heads. Nobody has to say a word as the three of us fall into our nightly routine.\\n\\nWe offer our prayer in unison, eyes shut tight as these words bounce from our mouths in a familiar cadence. \\u201cBless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts, which we are about to receive from Thy bounty, through Christ our Lord. Bless us so that we may know our place in his kingdom as servants. Bless us so that we may give service to the Lord and the righteous lambs will be spared when the scale of ends meets the scale of means. Bless the Kingdom of the Pine for lighting the darkened path that our Shepard walks. Amen.\\u201d\\n\\nI begin to lift my gaze, but before I get the chance my father launches into an additional blessing. He\\u2019s clearly caught the spirit this evening. \\u201cAnd bless the Prophet Cobel, for the wisdom he has bestowed. Bless the Four Tenets that guide us. But, most of all, bless our beautiful daughter on this important day. Amen.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAmen,\\u201d my mother and I respond in turn.\\n\\nThe three of us lift our gaze once more, taking a beat before getting to work and dishing out some pasta.\\n\\nLisa can\\u2019t help but chuckle to herself. \\u201cMost of all,\\u201d she repeats, shaking her head. \\u201cDon\\u2019t get cute, Luke.\\u201d\\n\\nShe\\u2019s referring to the part where my father placed my blessing above the Four Tenets and the Prophet Cobel. This is bad form and I\\u2019m a little bothered by it, but we\\u2019re playing it fast and loose tonight.\\n\\nAll I can do is refrain from pride and do better when it\\u2019s my turn to lead.\\n\\nThe third tenet: I will strive when my sin is heavy.\\n\\n\\u201cSo,\\u201d Mom begins, curiosity overwhelming her tone and elevating it into a playful sing-song frequency. \\u201cHow was your date?\\u201d\\n\\nI raise an eyebrow as I stab the mass of noodles before me, utterly confused. I begin to twirl my utensil. \\u201cWhat date?\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cWith Seth!\\u201d\\n\\nI can\\u2019t help but laugh. \\u201cAt the falls today?\\u201d I question. \\u201cIt was fun, but that wasn\\u2019t a date. We\\u2019re just friends.\\u201d\\n\\nThe cold chill I\\u2019d felt earlier immediately surges through my body, causing my hand to seize up and my body to shift awkwardly in the hard wooden chair.\\n\\nMy parents exchange glances again, as though passing some unspoken relay baton between them. My father clears his throat for a moment, ready to take over.\\n\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s a handsome guy, don\\u2019t you think?\\u201d Dad suggests.\\n\\nI shrug. \\u201cI mean, sure.\\u201d\\n\\nMom butts in, unable to go more than a single question and answer before leaping back into the fray. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t like that?\\u201d she demands to know. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want a boyfriend?\\u201d\\n\\nI raise my eyebrows, shocked by the statement.\\n\\nWe all love Jesus in the Darling household, but my parents are typically the ones who hoist this flag the highest and elevate my faith on a daily basis. I\\u2019m thankful to have two spiritual warriors consistently by my side, and through their pious diligence I\\u2019ve come to carry my own innate parental severity.\\n\\nThe idea of them actually encouraging me to have a boyfriend is shocking. I suppose my recent birthday could be the marker they were waiting for all along, but the turn they\\u2019ve taken is so alarming I\\u2019m left wondering if it\\u2019s a trap.\\n\\n\\u201cI think I should be focused on school right now,\\u201d I offer, hoping this is what they want to hear.\\n\\nMy mother reaches out and places her hand over mine, causing me to return a fresh spool of spaghetti to the plate.\\n\\n\\u201cHoney,\\u201d she begins softly. \\u201cThe Lord wants you to start a family. You\\u2019re a woman now, and finding a partner is a very important part of His plan. I know we\\u2019ve been a little\\u2026 strict about this before, but you should know it\\u2019s okay.\\u201d\\n\\nI\\u2019m not sure how to react, staring down at the table before me.\\n\\nMy father clears his throat, a sign he\\u2019s about to launch into a brief diatribe of religious theory. \\u201cYou know, when Tobias Cobel established the four tenets he did so in a way that was pretty genius. A lot of people see him as a man of faith and entrepreneurship, which he was, but he was also a family man.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTenet number four: excellence,\\u201d my mother chimes in. \\u201cI will preserver when my body does not.\\u201d\\n\\nI already know where they\\u2019re going with this, but I honor the moment and listen respectfully.\\n\\n\\u201cLiving on,\\u201d Dad continues. \\u201cThat could mean your spirit ascends to heaven, or that a business you\\u2019ve built keeps turning a profit. It could also mean your family line lives on.\\u201d\\n\\nI nod. \\u201cUnderstood,\\u201d is all I can think to say.\\n\\n\\u201cYou like Seth, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d my mother pushes, repeating her initial question. \\u201cBill and Anna tell us he\\u2019s really into you.\\u201d\\n\\nI now realize any denial regarding this supposed date will promptly be discarded and we\\u2019ll be taking another spin around the maypole. Clearly, there\\u2019s an answer my parents want to hear, and if I hope to enjoy this plate of spaghetti I\\u2019ll have to give it to them.\\n\\nStill, I refuse to lie. That\\u2019s a sin.\\n\\n\\u201cToday was good,\\u201d I reply, stretching my enthusiasm as far as it can possibly go. \\u201cSeth is really\\u2026 nice.\\u201d\\n\\nImmediately, the tension in my mother\\u2019s hand softens. She releases her grip as both of my parents sit back in their chairs, finally allowing a moment of rest.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t look up as I eat, but from the corner of my eye I see them watching with absolute satisfaction. They\\u2019re not even touching their food, just allowing the gratitude to wash over them as though I\\u2019m a toddler who finally learned to walk.\\n\\nEventually, the evening kicks back into gear and my parents plunge into their food. It seems my simple answer was just enough to satisfy whatever they were looking for.\\n\\nStill, a host of questions continue to linger in the back of my mind. Why were they talking to Seth\\u2019s parents about our day at the falls? Everyone in Neverton is pretty closely knit, especially members of the congregation, but as far as I knew Bill and Anna didn\\u2019t have a strong report with my folks.\\n\\nI try letting it slide and moving on, but the circumstances of this meeting remain firmly planted within my mind, unable to budge no matter how diligent my attempts to slip past.\\n\\nFinally, I turn back to my mother, my curiosity getting the better of me.\\n\\nI open my mouth to speak, but instead of any tangible words spilling from my throat, I find myself erupting with an unexpected cough.\\n\\nInstinctively, I reach for the tall glass of water on the table next to me, swiftly downing the cool liquid and trying again. However, this time I\\u2019m met with the same result at an even larger scale.\\n\\nSomething\\u2019s tickling the back of my throat, flooding me with frustration as I struggle to speak or even breathe. I begin to cough harder as expressions of grave concern wash across my parent\\u2019s faces.\\n\\n\\u201cAre you alright, hon?\\u201d Dad asks.\\n\\nA sudden, final cough unblocks my throat as air pumps forcefully from within, blasting forth the arbiter of my discomfort in a singular heave.\\n\\nI gag slightly, struggling to collect myself as my father pats me on the back with loving grace. \\u201cSomething go down the wrong pipe?\\u201d he asks with a chuckle.\\n\\nI nod, taking another long sip from my water glass. I gaze down at the plate of spaghetti before me, hoping to find the culprit and gasping abruptly \\u2013 nearly choking all over again.\\n\\nA small black fly wriggles atop my pasta, slathered in sauce as it hopelessly flits its wings in a futile attempt to escape.\\n\\n\\u201cOh my word,\\u201d my mother blurts, leaning forward a bit to get a better look.\\n\\nMy father does the same, adjusting his glasses as he struggles to take in this tiny, unexpected guest.\\n\\nThe whole family is silent for a moment, reeling.\\n\\n\\u201cMust\\u2019ve accidently swallowed the poor thing,\\u201d Dad suggests.\\n\\nI open my mouth to reply, but this simple movement causes an abrupt spasm to overwhelm my throat. I let out a loud, animalistic hurl as a cascade of black erupts from deep within me, pouring though my esophagus and spilling across the plate.\\n\\nThe upheaval is so sudden that my parents nearly fall backwards in their chairs, letting out cries of alarm as they instinctually push away.\\n\\nWhen this projectile finally ends, I stare down in utter horror, my body trembling as my mind races to understand the bizarre, squirming mass that\\u2019s now heaped onto my pasta and scattered across the table.\\n\\nThis black pile is churning and moving, crawling over itself as tiny wings flutter and miniature legs kick the air. I let out a scream as I realize this is not some toxic liquid but a dark porridge of living creatures, little flies born deep within my body before their sudden expulsion.\\n\\nExcerpted from Camp Damascus, copyright \\u00a9 2023 by Chuck Tingle\\n\\nExcerpt originally appeared on Tor.com in September 2022\"}, {\"source_name\": \"4Players Portal\", \"author\": null, \"title\": \"Steam Summer Sale: 5 abgedrehte Empfehlungen f\\u00fcr Japano-Fans\", \"description\": \"Im Steam Summer Sale finden sich Spiele aus allen Ecken der Welt und wer gerne Titeln aus dem Land der aufgehenden Sonne fr\\u00f6nt, der braucht nicht unbedingt lange suchen.\\n\\u00a0\\nDoch weil sich zwischen allseits bekannten und oft empfohlenen Spielen wie Persona 5 Ro\\u2026\", \"url\": \"https://www.4players.de/4players.php/spielinfonews/PC-CDROM/3693/2205257/Steam-5_abgedrehte_Empfehlungen_fuer_Japano-Fans_im_Summer_Sale.html\", \"text\": \"Catherine Classic\\n\\nEntwickler: Atlus\\n\\nAtlus Preis: 4,99 Euro (75 Prozent Rabatt)\\n\\n4,99 Euro (75 Prozent Rabatt) Link zur Steam-Produktseite\\n\\nNieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139...\\n\\nEntwickler: Square Enix, Toylogic Inc.\\n\\nSquare Enix, Toylogic Inc.

Irgendwobefinden sich, mal bunt, mal ernst und immer sch\\u00f6n abgedreht.Wer den Namen \\u201eAtlus\\u201c h\\u00f6rt, der denkt vermutlich als Erstes an Persona oder Shin Megami Tensei. Doch dass die japanische Spieleschmiede auch was anderes kann als rundenbasierte Rollenspiele, bewies man 2011 mit dem Release von. Die abgedrehtel\\u00e4sst euch in die schl\\u00fcpfrigen Sohlen von Vincent h\\u00fcpfen, der mit seiner Freundin Katherine eigentlich eine gesunde Beziehung f\\u00fchrt.Doch als er eines Tages in seiner Lieblingsbar auf die verf\\u00fchrerische Catherine trifft, ger\\u00e4t sein moralischer Kompass stark ins Wanken und schnell findet sich Vincent in einemwieder. Nachts holt ihn dann sein Gewissen ein, wenn der Casanova in schaurigen Albtr\\u00e4umen kilometerlange W\\u00fcrfelt\\u00fcrme erklimmt und dabei neben ein paar sprechenden Schafen auch auf echte Schreckgestalten trifft, denen ihr durch geschicktes Steine-Verschieben entkommen m\\u00fcsst.Auch wennbereits in jeder Liste zu japanischen Spielen (zurecht) seinen Platz findet, wollen wir an dieser Stelle nochmal f\\u00fcr den 2021 aufpolierten Vorg\\u00e4nger eine Lanze brechen., wie der bizarre Titel des Spiels lautet, ist n\\u00e4mlich mindestenswie sein viel gefeierter Nachfolger, bekommt aber trotz der verdienten Neuver\\u00f6ffentlichung deutlich weniger Beachtung. Als Bruder der an Runenpest erkrankten Yonah sucht ihr in NieR Replicant f\\u00fcr eure Schwester nach einem Heilmittel und bekommt dabei Hilfe vom sarkastischen Schm\\u00f6ker Grimoire Weiss, w\\u00e4hrend ihr die r\\u00e4tselhafte Spielwelt erkundet und fiese Schattenwesen unter die Erde schickt.Klar, spielerisch ist Replicant nicht ganz so ausgereift wie Automata und ein bisschen Spielzeitstreckung durch laufintensive Landschaftsbeschauung war beim urspr\\u00fcnglichen Release 2010 eben noch etwas \\u00fcblicher als heute. Doch wer \\u00fcber die kleinen Makel von Yoko Taros Werk hinwegschauen kann, bekommt mit NieR Replicant ein, das euch mit seinen facettenreichen Figuren, der ber\\u00fchrenden Geschichte und dem einzigartigen Soundtrack noch ganz lange im Ged\\u00e4chtnis bleiben wird.Wer an der japanischen Popkultur vor allem liebt, dass sie mitunter ziemlich laut, bunt und hektisch sein kann, dem sei das Rhyhmus-Spielempfohlen. Mit nur zwei Tasten haut ihr im Takt zu japanischer Pop-, Rock- und Elektronik-Musik Gegner auf zwei Bahnen aus dem Weg, womit der Titelist. Anspruch m\\u00fcsst ihr trotzdem nicht missen, denn jeder Song kommt in verschiedenen Schwierigkeitsgraden daher und die h\\u00f6heren erfordern verdammt flinke Finger.W\\u00e4hrend des Steam Summer Sales gibt es Muse Dash aktuell f\\u00fcr nur 52 Cent , womit ihr fast umsonst ein gutes Gef\\u00fchl f\\u00fcr das Gameplay bekommen k\\u00f6nnt. Falls euch dann gef\\u00e4llt, was \\u00fcber den Bildschirm flackert, lohnt der Griff zur sogenannten \\u201eJust as planned\\u201c-Version, die mit 21,44 Euro zwar teurer ist, daf\\u00fcr aber auchhat und euch so ein prall gef\\u00fclltes und lang anhaltendes Rhythmus-Paket schn\\u00fcrt.Spike Chunsoft ist vor allem f\\u00fcr die-Reihe bekannt, die wir euch schon inans Herz gelegt haben. Wer die Trilogie rund um den m\\u00f6rderischen Teddyb\\u00e4ren Monokuma bereits kennt, aber Lust auf weitere Morde und Mysterien hat, sollte zugreifen. Dahinter versteckt sich n\\u00e4mlich ein, bei dem ihr Tatorte untersuchen, Hinweise kombinieren und F\\u00e4lle l\\u00f6sen m\\u00fcsst.Angesiedelt im Tokyo der nahen Zukunft und versetzt mit einer Stimmung, bei der Genre-typisch die Dunkelheit von Regenn\\u00e4chten durch bunte Neonschilder durchbrochen wird, schl\\u00fcpft ihr in AI: The Somnium Files in die Rolle von Ermittler Kaname Date, der einem Serienm\\u00f6rder auf den Fersen ist. Dabei greift ihm dieunter die Arme, die mit ihren speziellen F\\u00e4higkeiten eine unerl\\u00e4ssliche Hilfe bei der M\\u00f6rderjagd ist.Alshaben wirvor zwei Jahrenbezeichnet und dieses Urteil trifft auch heute noch zu. Mit dem aktuellen Ableger der Reihe hat sich das Entwicklerstudio Arc System Works 2019 selbst \\u00fcbertroffen und kann sowohl bei der Optik als auch beim Gameplay in fast allen Punkten restlos \\u00fcberzeugen. Schon der Cel-Shading-Stil und die vielen bunten Designs der K\\u00e4mpfer und K\\u00e4mpferinnen ergeben zusammen einen Augenschmaus, der mit den vielen verr\\u00fcckten Animationen und Spezialangriffen nur noch beeindruckender wird.Zusammen mit dem rockigen und adrenalinerzeugenden Soundtrack bietet Guilty Gear -Strive- eine der prachtvollsten Pr\\u00e4sentationen im Genre. Und auch wenn es in Sachennicht mit dem frisch erschienenenmithalten kann, erlauben Man\\u00f6ver wie der Roman Cancel auch mal die spontane Befreiung aus der m\\u00e4chtigen Kombo des Gegners oder verl\\u00e4ngern die eigene, damit auch Gelegenheitsspieler nicht gleich abgeh\\u00e4ngt werden.\"}, {\"source_name\": \"Levelup.com\", \"author\": \"Ulises Contreras\", \"title\": \"EVO 2023 rompe r\\u00e9cord de jugadores inscritos gracias a Street Fighter 6\", \"description\": \"Sin lugar a dudas, la escena competitiva de juegos de lucha vive uno de sus mejores momentos.
