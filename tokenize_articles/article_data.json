Google DeepMind is the result of an internal merger: Google acquired Demis\u2019 DeepMind startup in 2014 and ran it as a separate company inside its parent company, Alphabet, while Google itself had an AI team called Google Brain.\n\nGoogle has been showing off AI demos for years now, but with the explosion of ChatGPT and a renewed threat from Microsoft in search, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai made the decision to bring DeepMind into Google itself earlier this year to create\u2026 Google DeepMind.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is that Google Brain and DeepMind were not necessarily compatible or even focused on the same things: DeepMind was famous for applying AI to things like games and protein-folding simulations. The AI that beat world champions at Go, the ancient board game? That was DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo. Meanwhile, Google Brain was more focused on what\u2019s come to be the familiar generative AI toolset: large language models for chatbots, editing features in Google Photos, and so on. This was a culture clash and a big structure decision with the goal of being more competitive and faster to market with AI products.\n\nAnd the competition isn\u2019t just OpenAI and Microsoft \u2014 you might have seen a memo from a Google engineer floating around the web recently claiming that Google has no competitive moat in AI because open-source models running on commodity hardware are rapidly evolving and catching up to the tools run by the giants. Demis confirmed that the memo was real but said it was part of Google\u2019s debate culture, and he disagreed with it because he has other ideas about where Google\u2019s competitive edge might come into play.\n\nOf course, we also talked about AI risk and especially artificial general intelligence. Demis is not shy that his goal is building an AGI, and we talked through what risks and regulations should be in place and on what timeline. Demis recently signed onto a 22-word statement about AI risk with OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and others that simply reads, \u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\u201d That\u2019s pretty chill, but is that the real risk right now? Or is it just a distraction from other more tangible problems like AI replacing a bunch of labor in various creative industries? We also talked about the new kinds of labor AI is creating \u2014 armies of low-paid taskers classifying data in countries like Kenya and India in order to train AI systems. We just published a big feature on these taskers. I wanted to know if Demis thought these jobs were here to stay or just a temporary side effect of the AI boom.\n\nThis one really hits all the Decoder high points: there\u2019s the big idea of AI, a lot of problems that come with it, an infinite array of complicated decisions to be made, and of course, a gigantic org chart decision in the middle of it all. Demis and I got pretty in the weeds, and I still don\u2019t think we covered it all, so we\u2019ll have to have him back soon.\n\nAlright, Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind. Here we go.\n\nThis transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity\n\nDemis Hassabis, you are the CEO of Google DeepMind. Welcome to Decoder.\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nI don\u2019t think we have ever had a more perfect Decoder guest. There\u2019s a big idea in AI. It comes with challenges and problems, and then, with you in particular, there\u2019s a gigantic org chart move and a set of high-stakes decisions to be made. I am thrilled that you are here.\n\nGlad to be here.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Google DeepMind itself. Google DeepMind is a new part of Google that is constructed of two existing parts of Google. There was Google Brain, which was the AI team we were familiar with as we covered Google that was run by Jeff Dean. And there was DeepMind, which was your company that you founded. You sold it to Alphabet in 2014. You were outside of Google. It was run as a separate company inside that holding company Alphabet structure until just now. Start at the very beginning. Why were DeepMind and Google Brain separate to begin with?\n\nAs you mentioned, we started DeepMind actually back in 2010, a long time ago now, especially in the age of AI. So that\u2019s sort of like prehistory. Myself and the co-founders, we realized coming from academia and seeing what was going on there, things like deep learning had just been invented. We were big proponents of reinforcement learning. We could see GPUs and other hardware was coming online, that a lot of great progress could be made with a focused effort on general learning systems and also taking some ideas from neuroscience and how the brain works. So we put all those ingredients together back in 2010. We had this thesis we\u2019d make fast progress, and that\u2019s what happened with our initial game systems. And then, we decided in 2014 to join forces with Google at the time because we could see that a lot more compute was going to be needed. Obviously, Google has the most computers and had the most computers in the world. That was the obvious home for us to be able to focus on pushing the research as fast as possible.\n\nSo you were acquired by Google, and then somewhere along the way, Google reoriented itself. They turned into Alphabet, and Google became a division of Alphabet. There are other divisions of Alphabet, and DeepMind was out of it. That\u2019s just the part I want to focus on here at the beginning, because there was what Google was doing with Google Brain, which is a lot of LLM research. I recall, six years ago, Google was showing off LLMs at Google I/O, but DeepMind was focused on winning the game [Go] and protein folding, a very different kind of AI research wholly outside of Google. Why was that outside of Google? Why was that in Alphabet proper?\n\nListen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems. Subscribe here!\n\nThat was part of the agreement as we were acquired was that we would pursue pushing forward research into general AI, or sometimes called AGI, a system that out of the box can operate across a wide range of cognitive tasks and basically has all the cognitive capabilities that humans have.\n\nAnd also using AI to accelerate scientific discovery, that\u2019s one of my personal passions. And that explains projects like AlphaFold that I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to get back to. But also, from the start of DeepMind and actually prior to even DeepMind starting, I believe that games was a perfect testing or proving ground for developing AI algorithms efficiently, quickly, and you can generate a lot of data and the objective functions are very clear: obviously, winning games or maximizing the score. There were a lot of reasons to use games in the early days of AI research, and that was a big part of why we were so successful and why we were able to advance so quickly with things like AlphaGo, the program that beat the world champion at the ancient game of Go.\n\nThose were all really important proof points for the whole field really that these general learning techniques would work. And of course we\u2019ve done a lot of work on deep learning and neural networks as well. And our specialty, I suppose, was combining that with reinforcement learning to allow these systems to actively solve problems and make plans and do things like win games. And in terms of the differences, we always had that remit to push the research agenda and push things, advanced science. And that was very much the focus we were given and very much the focus that I wanted to have. And then, the internal Google AI teams like Google Brain, they had slightly different remits and were a bit closer to product and obviously to the rest of Google and infusing Google with amazing AI technology. And we also had an applied division that was introducing DeepMind technology into Google products, too. But the cultures were quite different, and the remits were quite different.\n\nFrom the outside, the timeline looks like this: everyone\u2019s been working on this for ages, we\u2019ve all been talking about it for ages. It is a topic of conversation for a bunch of nerdy journalists like me, a bunch of researchers, we talk about it in the corner at Google events.\n\nThen ChatGPT is released, not even as a product. I don\u2019t even think Sam [Altman] would call it a great product when it was released, but it was just released, and people could use it. And everyone freaked out, and Microsoft releases Bing based on ChatGPT, and the world goes upside down, and Google reacts by merging DeepMind and Google Brain. That\u2019s what it looks like from the outside. Is that what it felt like from the inside?\n\nThat timeline is correct, but it\u2019s not these direct consequences; it\u2019s more indirect in a sense. So, Google and Alphabet have always run like this. They let many flowers bloom, and I think that\u2019s always been the way that even from Larry [Page] and Sergey [Brin] from the beginning set up Google. And it served them very well, and it\u2019s allowed them to organically create incredible things and become the amazing company that it is today. On the research side, I think it\u2019s very compatible with doing research, which is another reason we chose Google as our partners back in 2014. I felt they really understood what fundamental and blue sky research was, ambitious research was, and they were going to facilitate us being and enable us to be super ambitious with our research. And you\u2019ve seen the results of that, right?\n\n\u201c...AI has entered a new era.\u201d\n\nBy any measure, AlphaGo, AlphaFold, but more than 20 nature and science papers and so on \u2014 all the normal metrics one would use for really delivering amazing cutting-edge research we were able to do. But in a way, what ChatGPT and the large models and the public reaction to that confirmed is that AI has entered a new era. And by the way, it was a little bit surprising for all of us at the coalface, including OpenAI, how viral that went because \u2014 us and some other startups like Anthropic and OpenAI \u2014 we all had these large language models. They were roughly the same capabilities.\n\nAnd so, it was surprising, not so much what the technology was because we all understood that, but the public\u2019s appetite for that and obviously the buzz that generated. And I think that\u2019s indicative of something we\u2019ve all been feeling for the last, I would say, two, three years, which is these systems are reaching a level of maturity now and sophistication where it can really come out of the research phase and the lab and go into powering incredible next-generation products and experiences and also breakthroughs, things like AlphaFold directly being useful for biologists. And so, to me, this is just indicative of a new phase that AI is in of being practically useful to people in their everyday lives and actually being able to solve really hard real-world problems that really matter, not just the curiosities or fun, like games.\n\nWhen you recognize that shift, then I think that necessitates a change in your approach as to how you\u2019re approaching the research and how much focus you\u2019re having on products and those kinds of things. And I think that\u2019s what we all came to the realization of, which was: now was the time to streamline our AI efforts and focus them more. And the obvious conclusion of that was to do the merger.\n\nI want to just stop there for one second and ask a philosophical question.\n\nSure.\n\nIt feels like the ChatGPT moment that led to this AI explosion this year was really rooted in the AI being able to do something that regular people could do. I want you to write me an email, I want you to write me a screenplay, and maybe the output of the LLM is a C+, but it\u2019s still something I can do. People can see it. I want you to fill out the rest of this photo. That\u2019s something people can imagine doing. Maybe they don\u2019t have the skills to do it, but they can imagine doing it. All the previous AI demos that we have gotten, even yours, AlphaFold, you\u2019re like, this is going to model all the proteins in the world.\n\nBut I can\u2019t do that; a computer should do that. Even a microbiologist might think, \u201cThat is great. I\u2019m very excited that a computer can do that because I\u2019m just looking at how much time it would take us, and there\u2019s no way we could ever do it.\u201d \u201cI want to beat the world champion at Go. I can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s like, fine. A computer can do that.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s this turn where the computer is starting to do things I can do, and they\u2019re not even necessarily the most complicated tasks. Read this webpage and deliver a summary of it to me. But that\u2019s the thing that unlocked everyone\u2019s brain. And I\u2019m wondering why you think the industry didn\u2019t see that turn coming because we\u2019ve been very focused on these very difficult things that people couldn\u2019t do, and it seems like what got everyone is when the computer started doing things people do all the time.\n\nI think that analysis is correct. I think that is why the large language models have really entered the public consciousness because it\u2019s something the average person, that the \u201cJoe Public,\u201d can actually understand and interact with. And, of course, language is core to human intelligence and our everyday lives. I think that does explain why chatbots specifically have gone viral in the way they have. Even though I would say things like AlphaFold, I mean of course I\u2019d be biased in saying this, but I think it\u2019s actually had the most unequivocally biggest beneficial effects so far in AI on the world because if you talk to any biologist or there\u2019s a million biologists now, researchers and medical researchers, have used AlphaFold. I think that\u2019s nearly every biologist in the world. Every Big Pharma company is using it to advance their drug discovery programs. I\u2019ve had multiple, dozens, of Nobel Prize-winner-level biologists and chemists talk to me about how they\u2019re using AlphaFold.\n\nSo a certain set of all the world\u2019s scientists, let\u2019s say, they all know AlphaFold, and it\u2019s affected and massively accelerated their important research work. But of course, the average person in the street doesn\u2019t know what proteins are even and doesn\u2019t know what the importance of those things are for things like drug discovery. Whereas obviously, for a chatbot, everyone can understand, this is incredible. And it\u2019s very visceral to get it to write you a poem or something that everybody can understand and process and measure compared to what they do or are able to do.\n\nIt seems like that is the focus of productized AI: these chatbot-like interfaces or these generative products that are going to make stuff for people, and that\u2019s where the risk has been focused. But even the conversation about risk has escalated because people can now see, \u201cOh, these tools can do stuff.\u201d Did you perceive the same level of scrutiny when you were working on AlphaFold? It doesn\u2019t seem like anyone thought, \u201cOh, AlphaFold\u2019s going to destroy humanity.\u201d\n\nNo, but there was a lot of scrutiny, but again, it was in a very specialized area, right? With renowned experts, and actually, we did talk to over 30 experts in the field, from top biologists to bioethicists to biosecurity people, and actually our partners \u2014 we partnered with the European Bioinformatics Institute to release the AlphaFold database of all the protein structures, and they guided us as well on how this could be safely put out there. So there was a lot of scrutiny, and the overwhelming conclusion from the people we consulted was that the benefits far outweighed any risks. Although we did make some small adjustments based on their feedback about which structures to release. But there was a lot of scrutiny, but again, it\u2019s just in a very expert domain. And just going back to your first question about the generative models, I do think we are right at the beginning of an incredible new era that\u2019s going to play out over the next five, 10 years.\n\nNot only in advancing science with AI but in terms of the types of products we can build to improve people\u2019s everyday lives, billions of people in their everyday lives, and help them to be more efficient and to enrich their lives. And I think what we\u2019re seeing today with these chatbots is literally just scratching the surface. There are a lot more types of AI than generative AI. Generative AI is now the \u201cin\u201d thing, but I think that planning and deep reinforcement learning and problem-solving and reasoning, those kinds of capabilities are going to come back in the next wave after this, along with the current capabilities of the current systems. So I think, in a year or two\u2019s time, if we were to talk again, we are going to be talking about entirely new types of products and experiences and services with never-seen-before capabilities. And I\u2019m very excited about building those things, actually. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m very excited about leading Google DeepMind now in this new era and focusing on building these AI-powered next-generation products.\n\nLet\u2019s stay in the weeds of Google DeepMind itself, for one more turn. Sundar Pichai comes to you and says, \u201cAll right, I\u2019m the CEO of Alphabet and the CEO of Google. I can just make this call. I\u2019m going to bring DeepMind into Google, merge you with Google Brain, you\u2019re going to be the CEO.\u201d How did you react to that prompt?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like that. It was much more of a conversation between the leaders of the various different relevant groups and Sundar about pretty much the inflection point that we\u2019re seeing, the maturity of the systems, what could be possible with those in the product space, and how to improve experiences for our users, our billions of users, and how exciting that might be, and what that all requires in totality. Both the change in focus, a change in the approach to research, the combination of resources that are required, like compute resources. So there was a big collection of factors to take into account that we all discussed as a leadership group, and then, conclusions from that then result in actions, including the merger and also what the plans are then for the next couple of years and what the focus should be of that merged unit.\n\nDo you perceive a difference being a CEO inside of Google versus being a CEO inside of Alphabet?\n\nIt\u2019s still early days, but I think it\u2019s been pretty similar because, although DeepMind was an Alphabet company, it was very unusual for another bet, as they call it an \u201calpha bet,\u201d which is that we already were very closely integrated and collaborating with many of the Google product area teams and groups. We had an applied team at DeepMind whose job it was to translate our research work into features in products by collaborating with the Google product teams. And so, we\u2019ve had hundreds of successful launches already actually over the last few years, just quiet ones behind the scenes. So, in fact, many of the services or devices or systems that you use every day at Google will have some DeepMind technology under the hood as a component. So we already had that integrative structure, and then, of course, what we were famous for was doing the scientific advances and gaming advances, but behind the scenes, there was a lot of bread and butter work going on that was affecting all parts of Google.\n\nWe were different from other bets where they have to make a business outside of Google and become an independent business. That was never the goal or the remit for us, even as an independent bet company. And now, within Google, we\u2019re just more tightly integrated in terms of the product services, and I see that as an advantage because we can actually go deeper and do more exciting and ambitious things in much closer collaboration with these other product teams than we could from outside of Google. But we still retain some latitude to pick the processes and the systems that optimize our mission of producing the most capable and general AI systems in the world.\n\nThere\u2019s been reporting that this is actually a culture clash. You\u2019re now in charge of both. How have you structured the group? How has Google DeepMind structured under you as CEO, and how are you managing that culture integration?\n\nActually, it turns out that the culture\u2019s a lot more similar than perhaps has been reported externally. And in the end, it\u2019s actually been surprisingly smooth and pleasant because you\u2019re talking about two world-class research groups, two of the best AI research organizations in the world, incredible talent on both sides, storied histories. As we were thinking about the merger and planning it, we were looking at some document where we listed the top 10 breakthroughs from each group. And when you take that in totality, it\u2019s like 80\u201390 percent of over the last decade, of the breakthroughs that underpin the modern AI industry, from deep reinforcement learning to transformers, of course. It\u2019s an incredible set of people and talent, and there\u2019s massive respect for both groups on both sides. And there was actually a lot of collaboration on a project-based level ongoing over the last decade.\n\nOf course, we all know each other very well. I just think it\u2019s a question of focus and a bit of coordination across both groups, actually, and more in terms of what are we going to focus on, other places that it makes sense for the two separate teams to collaborate on, and maybe de-duplicate some efforts that basically are overlapping. So fairly obvious stuff, to be honest, but it\u2019s important moving into this new phase now of where we are into more of an engineering phase of AI, and that requires huge resources, both compute, engineering, and other things. And, even as a company the size of Google, we\u2019ve got to pick our bets carefully and be clear about which arrows we are going to put our wood behind and then focus on those and then massively deliver on those things. So I think it\u2019s part of the natural course of evolution as to where we are in the AI journey.\n\nThat thing you talked about, \u201cWe\u2019re going to combine these groups, we\u2019re going to pick what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re going to de-duplicate some efforts.\u201d Those are structure questions. Have you decided on a structure yet, and what do you think that structure will be?\n\nThe structure\u2019s still evolving. We\u2019re only a couple of months into it. We wanted to make sure we didn\u2019t break anything, that it was working. Both teams are incredibly productive, doing super amazing research, but also plugging in to very important product things that are going on. All of that needs to continue.\n\nYou keep saying both teams. Do you think of it as two teams, or are you trying to make one team?\n\nNo, no, for sure it\u2019s one unified team. I like to call it a \u201csuper unit,\u201d and I\u2019m very excited about that. But obviously, we\u2019re still combining that and forming the new culture and forming the new grouping, including the organizational structures. It\u2019s a complex thing \u2014 putting two big research groups together like this. But I think, by the end of the summer, we\u2019ll be a single unified entity, and I think that\u2019ll be very exciting. And we\u2019re already feeling, even a couple of months in, the benefits and the strengths of that with projects like Gemini that you may have heard of, which is our next-generation multimodal large models \u2014 very, very exciting work going on there, combining all the best ideas from across both world-class research groups. It\u2019s pretty impressive to see.\n\nYou have a lot of decisions to make. What you\u2019re describing is a bunch of complicated decisions and then, out in the world, how should we regulate this? Another set of very complicated decisions. You are a chess champion, you are a person who has made games. What is your framework for making decisions? I suspect it is much more rigorous than the other ones I hear about.\n\n\u201cChess is basically decision-making under pressure with an opponent.\u201d\n\nYes, I think it probably is. And I think if you play a game like chess that seriously \u2014 effectively professionally \u2014 since all my childhood, since the age of four, I think it\u2019s very formative for your brain. So I think, in chess, the problem-solving and strategizing, I find it a very useful framework for many things and decision-making. Chess is basically decision-making under pressure with an opponent, and it\u2019s very complex, and I think it\u2019s a great thing. I advocate it being taught at school, part of the school curriculum, because I think it\u2019s a really fantastic training ground for problem-solving and decision-making. But then, I think actually the overarching approach is more of the scientific method.\n\nSo I think all my training is doing my PhDs and postdocs and so on, obviously I did it in neuroscience, so I was learning about the brain, but it also taught me how to do rigorous hypothesis testing and hypothesis generation and then update based on empirical evidence. The whole scientific method as well as the chess planning, both can be translated into the business domain. You have to be smart about how to translate that, you can\u2019t be academic about these things. And often, in the real world, in business, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty and hidden information that you don\u2019t know. So, in chess, obviously all the information\u2019s there for you on the board. You can\u2019t just directly translate those skills, but I think, in the background, they can be very helpful if applied in the right way.\n\nHow do you combine those two in some decisions you\u2019ve made?\n\nThere are so many decisions I make every day,it\u2019s hard to come up with one now. But I tend to try and plan out and scenario a plan many, many years in advance. So I tell you the way I try to approach things is, I have an end goal. I\u2019m quite good at imagining things, so that\u2019s a different skill, visualizing or imagining what would a perfect end state look like, whether that\u2019s organizational or it\u2019s product-based or it\u2019s research-based. And then, I work back from the end point and then figure out what all the steps would be required and in what order to make that outcome as likely as possible.\n\nSo that\u2019s a little bit chess-like, right? In the sense of you have some plan that you would like to get to checkmate your opponent, but you\u2019re many moves away from that. So what are the incremental things one must do to improve your position in order to increase the likelihood of that final outcome? And I found that extremely useful to do that search process from the end goal back to the current state that you find yourself in.\n\nLet\u2019s put that next to some products. You said there\u2019s a lot of DeepMind technology and a lot of Google products. The ones that we can all look at are Bard and then your Search Generative Experience. There\u2019s AI in Google Photos and all this stuff, but focused on the LLM moment, it\u2019s Bard and the Search Generative Experience. Those can\u2019t be the end state. They\u2019re not finished. Gemini is coming, and we\u2019ll probably improve both of those, and all that will happen. When you think about the end state of those products, what do you see?\n\nThe AI systems around Google are also not just in the consumer-facing things but also under the hood that you may not realize. So even, for example, one of the things we applied our AI systems to very initially was the cooling systems in Google\u2019s data centers, enormous data centers, and actually reducing the energy they use by nearly 30 percent that the cooling systems use, which is obviously huge if you multiply that by all of the data centers and computers they have there. So there are actually a lot of things under the hood where AI is being used to improve the efficiency of those systems all the time. But you\u2019re right, the current products are not the end state; they\u2019re actually just waypoints. And in the case of chatbots and those kinds of systems, ultimately, they will become these incredible universal personal assistants that you use multiple times during the day for really useful and helpful things across your daily lives.\n\n\u201c...today\u2019s chatbots will look trivial by comparison to I think what\u2019s coming in the next few years.\u201d\n\nFrom what books to read to recommendations on maybe live events and things like that to booking your travel to planning trips for you to assisting you in your everyday work. And I think we\u2019re still far away from that with the current chatbots, and I think we know what\u2019s missing: things like planning and reasoning and memory, and we are working really hard on those things. And I think what you\u2019ll see in maybe a couple of years\u2019 time is today\u2019s chatbots will look trivial by comparison to I think what\u2019s coming in the next few years.\n\nMy background is as a person who\u2019s reported on computers. I think of computers as somewhat modular systems. You look at a phone \u2014 it\u2019s got a screen, it\u2019s got a chip, it\u2019s got a cell antenna, whatever. Should I look at AI systems that way \u2014 there\u2019s an LLM, which is a very convincing human language interface, and behind it might be AlphaFold that\u2019s actually doing the protein folding? Is that how you\u2019re thinking about stitching these things together, or is it a different evolutionary pathway?\n\nActually, there\u2019s a whole branch of research going into what\u2019s called tool use. This is the idea that these large language models or large multimodal models, they\u2019re expert at language, of course, and maybe a few other capabilities, like math and possibly coding. But when you ask them to do something specialized, like fold a protein or play a game of chess or something like this, then actually what they end up doing is calling a tool, which could be another AI system, that then provides the solution or the answer to that particular problem. And then that\u2019s transmitted back to the user via language or pictorially through the central large language model system. So it may be actually invisible to the user because, to the user, it just looks like one big AI system that has many capabilities, but under the hood, it could be that actually the AI system is broken down into smaller ones that have specializations.\n\nAnd I actually think that probably is going to be the next era. The next generation of systems will use those kinds of capabilities. And then you can think of the central system as almost a switch statement that you effectively prompt with language, and it roots your query or your question or whatever it is you\u2019re asking it to the right tool to solve that question for you or provide the solution for you. And then transmit that back in a very understandable way. Again, using through the interface, the best interface really, of natural language.\n\nDoes that process get you closer to an AGI, or does that get you to some maximum state and you got to do something else?\n\nI think that is on the critical path to AGI, and that\u2019s another reason, by the way, I\u2019m very excited about this new role and actually doing more products and things because I actually think the product roadmap from here and the research roadmap from here toward something like AGI or human-level AI is very complementary. The kinds of capabilities one would need to push in order to build those kinds of products that are useful in your everyday life like a universal assistant requires pushing on some of these capabilities, like planning and memory and reasoning, that I think are vital for us to get to AGI. So I actually think there\u2019s a really neat feedback loop now between products and research where they can effectively help each other.\n\nI feel like I had a lot of car CEOs on the show at the beginning of it. I asked all of them, \u201cWhen do you think we\u2019re going to get self-driving cars?\u201d And they all said five years, and they\u2019ve been saying five years for five years, right?\n\nYes.\n\nI\u2019m going to ask you a version of that question about AGI, but I feel like the number has gotten smaller recently with people I\u2019ve talked to. How many years until you think we have AGI?\n\nI think there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty over how many more breakthroughs are required to get to AGI, big, big breakthroughs \u2014 innovative breakthroughs \u2014 versus just scaling up existing solutions. And I think it very much depends on that in terms of timeframe. Obviously, if there are a lot of breakthroughs still required, those are a lot harder to do and take a lot longer. But right now, I would not be surprised if we approached something like AGI or AGI-like in the next decade.\n\nIn the next decade. All right, I\u2019m going to come back to you in 10 years. We\u2019re going to see if that happens.\n\nSure.\n\nThat\u2019s not a straight line, though. You called it the critical path, that\u2019s not a straight line. There are breakthroughs along the way that might upset the train and send you along a different path, you think.\n\n\u201c...research is never a straight line. If it is, then it\u2019s not real research.\u201d\n\nResearch is never a straight line. If it is, then it\u2019s not real research. If you knew the answer before you started it, then that\u2019s not research. So research and blue sky research at the frontier always has uncertainty around it, and that\u2019s why you can\u2019t really predict timelines with any certainty. But what you can look at is trends, and we can look at the quality of ideas and projects that are being worked on today, look at how they\u2019re progressing. And I think that could go either way over the next five to 10 years where we might asymptote, we might hit a brick wall with current techniques and scaling. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that happened, either: that we may find that just scaling the existing systems resulted in diminishing returns in terms of the performance of the system.\n\nAnd actually, that would then signal some new innovations were really required to make further progress. At the moment, I think nobody knows which regime we\u2019re in. So the answer to that is you have to push on both as hard as possible. So both the scaling and the engineering of existing systems and existing ideas as well as investing heavily into exploratory research directions that you think might deliver innovations that might solve some of the weaknesses in the current systems. And that\u2019s one advantage of being a large research organization with a lot of resources is we can bet on both of those things maximally, both of those directions. In a way, I\u2019m agnostic to that question of \u201cdo we need more breakthroughs or will existing systems just scale all the way?\u201d My view is it\u2019s an empirical question, and one should push both as hard as possible. And then the results will speak for themselves.\n\nThis is a real tension. When you were at DeepMind in Alphabet and you were very research-focused, and then the research was moved back into Google and Google\u2019s engineers would turn it into products. And you can see how that relationship worked. Now, you\u2019re inside of Google. Google is under a lot of pressure as a company to win this battle. And those are product concerns. Those are \u201cMake it real for people and go win in the market.\u201d There\u2019s a leaked memo that went around. It was purportedly from inside Google. It said the company had no moat and open-source AI models or leaked models would run on people\u2019s laptops, and they would outpace the company because the history of open computing would outpace a closed-source competitor. Was that memo real?\n\n\u201cI think that memo was real.\u201d\n\nI think that memo was real. I think engineers at Google often write various documents, and sometimes they get leaked and go viral. I think that\u2019s just a thing that happens, but I wouldn\u2019t take it too seriously. These are just opinions. I think it\u2019s interesting to listen to them, and then you\u2019ve got to chart your own course. And I haven\u2019t read that specific memo in detail, but I disagree with the conclusions from that. And I think there\u2019s obviously open source and publishing, and we\u2019ve done tons of that in the history of DeepMind. I mean, AlphaFold was open sourced, right? So we obviously believe in open source and supporting research and open research. That\u2019s a key thing of the scientific discourse, which we\u2019ve been a huge part of. And so is Google, of course, publishing transformers and other things. And TensorFlow and you look at all the things we\u2019ve done.\n\nWe do a huge amount in that space. But I also think there are other considerations that need to be had as well. Obviously commercial ones but also safety questions about access to these very powerful systems. What if bad actors can access it? Who maybe aren\u2019t that technical, so they couldn\u2019t have built it themselves, but they can certainly reconfigure a system that is out there? What do you do about those things? And I think that\u2019s been quite theoretical till now, but I think that that is really important from here all the way to AGI as these systems become more general, more sophisticated, more powerful. That question is going to be very important about how does one stop bad actors just using these systems for things they weren\u2019t intended for but for malicious purposes.\n\nThat\u2019s something we need to increasingly come up with, but just back to your question, look at the history of what Google and DeepMind have done in terms of coming up with new innovations and breakthroughs and multiple, multiple breakthroughs over the last decade or more. And I would bet on us, and I\u2019m certainly very confident that that will continue and actually be even more true over the next decade in terms of us producing the next key breakthroughs just like we did in the past.\n\nDo you think that\u2019s the moat: we invented most of this stuff, so we\u2019re going to invent most of the next stuff?\n\nI don\u2019t really think about it as moats, but I\u2019m an incredibly competitive person. That\u2019s maybe another thing I got from chess, and many researchers are. Of course, they\u2019re doing it to discover knowledge, and ultimately, that\u2019s what we are here for is to improve the human condition. But also, we want to be first to do these things and do them responsibly and boldly. We have some of the world\u2019s best researchers. I think we have the biggest collection of great researchers in the world, anywhere in the world, and an incredible track record. And there\u2019s no reason why that shouldn\u2019t continue in the future. And in fact, I think with our new organization and environment might be conducive to even more and faster-paced breakthroughs than we\u2019ve done in the past.\n\nYou\u2019re leading me toward risk and regulation. I want to talk about that, but I want to start in with just a different spin on it. You\u2019re talking about all the work that has to be done. You\u2019re talking about deep mind reinforcement learning, how that works. We ran a gigantic cover story in collaboration with New York Magazine about the taskers who are actually doing the training, who are actually labeling the data. There\u2019s a lot of labor conversation with AI along the way. Hollywood writers are on strike right now because they don\u2019t want ChatGPT to write a bunch of scripts. I think that\u2019s appropriate.\n\nBut then there\u2019s a new class of labor that\u2019s being developed where a bunch of people around the world are sitting in front of computers and saying, \u201cYep, that\u2019s a stop sign. No, that\u2019s not a stop sign. Yep, that\u2019s clothes you can wear. No, that\u2019s not clothes you can wear.\u201d Is that a forever state? Is that just a new class of work that needs to be done for these systems to operate? Or does that come to an end?\n\nI think it\u2019s hard to say. I think it\u2019s definitely a moment in time and the current systems and what they\u2019re requiring at the moment. We\u2019ve been very careful just to say, from our part, and I think you quoted some of our researchers in that article, to be very careful to pay living wages and be very responsible about how we do that kind of work and which partners we use. And we also use internal teams as well. So actually, I\u2019m very proud of how responsible we\u2019ve been on that type of work. But going forward, I think there may be ways that these systems, especially once you have millions and millions of users, effectively can bootstrap themselves. Or one could imagine AI systems that are capable of actually conversing with themselves or critiquing themselves.\n\nThis would be a bit like turning language systems into a game-like setting, which of course we\u2019re very expert in and we\u2019ve been thinking about where these reinforcement learning systems, different versions of them, can actually rate each other in some way. And it may not be as good as a human rater, but it\u2019s actually a useful way to do some of the bread and butter rating and then maybe just calibrate it by checking those ratings with a human rater at the end, rather than getting human raters to rate everything. So I think there are lots of innovations I can see coming down the line that will help with this and potentially mean that there\u2019s less requirement for this all to be done by human raters.\n\nBut you think there are always human raters in the mix? Even as you get closer to AGI, it seems like you need someone to tell the computer if it\u2019s doing a good job or not.\n\nLet\u2019s take AlphaZero as an example, our general games playing system that ended up learning, itself, how to play any two-player game, including chess and Go. And it\u2019s interesting. What happened there is we set up the system so that it could play against itself tens of millions of times. So, in fact, it built up its own knowledge base. It started from random, played itself, bootstrapped itself, trained better versions of itself, and played those off each other in sort of mini-tournaments. But at the end, you still want to test it against the human world champion or something like this or an external computer program that was built in a conventional way so that you can just calibrate your own metrics, which are telling you these systems are improving according to these objectives or these metrics.\n\nBut you don\u2019t know for sure until you calibrate it with an external benchmark or measure. And depending on what that is, a human rater or human benchmark \u2014 a human expert is often the best thing to calibrate your internal testing against. And you make sure that your internal tests are actually mapping reality. And again, that\u2019s something quite exciting about products for researchers because, when you put your research into products and millions of people are using it every day, that\u2019s when you get real-world feedback, and there\u2019s no way around that, right? That\u2019s the reality, and that\u2019s the best test of any theories or any system that you\u2019ve built.\n\nDo you think that work is rewarding or appropriate, the labeling of data for AI systems? There\u2019s just something about that, which is, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell a computer how to understand the world so that it might go off in the future and displace other people.\u201d There\u2019s a loop in there that seems like it\u2019s worth more just moral or philosophical consideration. Have you spent time thinking about that?\n\nYeah, I do think about that. I think I don\u2019t really see it like that. I think that what raters are doing is they\u2019re part of the development cycle of making these systems safer, more useful for everybody, and more helpful and more reliable. So I think it\u2019s a critical component. In many industries, we have safety testing of technologies and products. Today, that\u2019s the best we can do for AI systems is to have human raters. I think, in the future, the next few years, I think we need a lot more research. And I\u2019ve been calling for this, and we are doing this ourselves, but it needs more than just one organization to do this, is great, robust evaluation benchmarks for capabilities so that we know if a system passes these benchmarks, then it has certain properties, and it\u2019s safe and it\u2019s reliable in these particular ways.\n\nAnd right now, I think we are in the space of many researchers in academia and civil society and elsewhere, we have a lot of good suggestions for what those tests could be, but I don\u2019t think they are robust or practical yet. I think they\u2019re basically theoretical and philosophical in nature, and I think they need to be made practical so that we can measure our systems empirically against those tests and then that gives us some assurances about how the system will perform. And I think once we have those, then the need for this human rating testing feedback will be reduced. I just think that\u2019s required in the volumes that\u2019s required now because we don\u2019t have these kinds of independent benchmarks yet. Partly because we haven\u2019t rigorously defined what those properties are. I mean, it\u2019s almost a neuroscience and psychology and philosophy area as well, right? A lot of these terms have not been defined properly, even for the human brain.\n\nYou\u2019ve signed a letter from the Center for AI Safety \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and others have also signed this letter \u2014 that warns against the risk from AI. And yet, you\u2019re pushing on, Google\u2019s in the market, you\u2019ve got to win, you\u2019ve described yourself as competitive. There\u2019s a tension there: needing to win in the market with products and \u201cOh boy, please regulate us because raw capitalism will drive us off the cliff with AI if we don\u2019t stop it in some way.\u201d How do you balance that risk?\n\nIt is a tension. It\u2019s a creative tension. What we like to say at Google is we want to be bold and responsible, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to do and live out and role model. So the bold part is being brave and optimistic about the benefits, the amazing benefits, incredible benefits, AI can bring to the world and to help humanity with our biggest challenges, whether that\u2019s disease or climate or sustainability. AI has a huge part to play in helping our scientists and medical experts solve those problems. And we\u2019re working hard on that and all those areas. And AlphaFold, again, I\u2019d point to as a poster child for that, what we want to do there. So that\u2019s the bold part. And then, the responsible bit is to make sure we do that as thoughtfully as possible with as much foresight as possible ahead of time.\n\nTry and anticipate what the issues might be if one was successful ahead of time. Not in hindsight, and perhaps this happened with social media, for example, where it is this incredible growth story. Obviously, it\u2019s done a lot of good in the world, but then it turns out 15 years later we realize there are some unintended consequences as well to those types of systems. And I would like to chart a different path with AI. And I think it\u2019s such a profound and important and powerful technology. I think we have to do that with something as potentially as transformative as AI. And it doesn\u2019t mean no mistakes will be made. It\u2019s very new, anything new, you can\u2019t predict everything ahead of time, but I think we can try and do the best job we can.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very new. You can\u2019t predict everything ahead of time, but I think we can try and do the best job we can.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s what signing that letter was for was just to point out that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely, I don\u2019t know on the timescales, but it\u2019s something that we should consider, too, in the limit is what these systems can do and might be able to do as we get closer to AGI. We are nowhere near that now. So this is not a question of today\u2019s technologies or even the next few years\u2019, but at some point, and given the technology\u2019s accelerating very fast, we will need to think about those questions, and we don\u2019t want to be thinking about them on the eve of them happening. We need to use the time now, the next five, 10, whatever it is, years, to do the research and to do the analysis and to engage with various stakeholders, civil society, academia, government, to figure out, as this stuff is developing very rapidly, what the best way is of making sure we maximize the benefits and minimize any risks.\n\nAnd that includes mostly, at this stage, doing more research into these areas, like coming up with better evaluations and benchmarks to rigorously test the capabilities of these frontier systems.\n\nYou talked about tool usage for AI models, you ask an LLM to do something, it goes off and asks AlphaFold to fold the protein for you. Combining systems like that, integrating systems like that, historically that\u2019s where emergent behaviors appear, things you couldn\u2019t have predicted start happening. Are you worried about that? There\u2019s not a rigorous way to test that.\n\nRight, exactly. I think that\u2019s exactly the sort of thing we should be researching and thinking about ahead of time is: as tool use becomes more sophisticated and you can combine different AI systems together in different ways, there is scope for emergent behavior. Of course, that emergent behavior may be very desirable and be extremely useful, but it could also potentially be harmful in the wrong hands and in the hands of bad actors, whether that\u2019s individuals or even nation-states.\n\nLet\u2019s say the United States and the EU and China all agree on some framework to regulate AI, and then North Korea or Iran says, \u201cFuck it, no rules.\u201d And that becomes a center of bad actor AI research. How does that play out? Do you foresee a world in which that\u2019s possible?\n\nYeah, I think that is a possible world. This is why I\u2019ve been talking to governments \u2014 UK, US mostly, but also EU \u2014 on I think whatever regulations or guardrails or whatever that is that transpires over the next few years, and tests. They ideally would be international, and there would be international cooperation around those safeguards and international agreement around deployment of these systems and other things. Now, I don\u2019t know how likely that is given the geopolitical tensions around the world, but that is by far the best state. And I think what we should be aiming for if we can.\n\nIf the government here passes a rule. It says, \u201cHere\u2019s what Google is allowed to do, here\u2019s what Microsoft is allowed to do. You are in charge, you are accountable.\u201d And you can go say, \u201cAll right, we\u2019re just not running this code in our data center. We are not going to have these capabilities; it\u2019s not legal.\u201d If I\u2019m just a person with a MacBook, would you accept some limitation on what a MacBook could do because the threat from AI is so scary? That\u2019s the thing I worry about. Practically, if you have open-source models and people are going to use them for weird things, are we going to tell Intel to restrict what its chips can do? How would we implement that such that it actually affects everyone? And not just, we\u2019re going to throw Demis in jail if Google does stuff we don\u2019t like.\n\nI think those are the big questions that are being debated right now. And I do worry about that. On the one hand, there are a lot of benefits of open-sourcing and accelerating scientific discourse and lots of advances happen there and it gives access to many developers. On the other hand, there could be some negative consequences with that if there are bad individual actors that do bad things with that access and that proliferates. And I think that\u2019s a question for the next few years that will need to be resolved. Because right now, I think it\u2019s okay because the systems are not that sophisticated or that powerful and therefore not that risky.\n\nBut I think, as systems increase in their power and generality, the access question will need to be thought about from government and how they want to restrict that or control that or monitor that is going to be an important question. I don\u2019t have any answers for you because I think this is a societal question actually that requires stakeholders from right across society to come together and weigh up the benefits with the risks there.\n\nGoogle\u2019s own work, you said we\u2019re not there yet, but Google\u2019s own work in AI certainly had some controversy associated with this around responsibility, around what the models can do or can\u2019t do. There\u2019s a famous \u201cStochastic Parrots\u201d paper from Emily Bender and Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell that led to a lot of controversy inside of Google. It led to them leaving. Did you read that paper and think, \u201cOkay, this is correct. LLMs are going to lie to people and Google will be responsible for that\u201d? And how do you think about that now with all of the scrutiny?\n\nYeah, look, the large language models, and I think this is one reason that Google\u2019s been very responsible with this, is that we know that they hallucinate and they can be inaccurate. And that\u2019s one of the key areas that has to be improved over the next few years is factuality and grounding and making sure that they don\u2019t spread disinformation, these kinds of things. And that\u2019s very much top of mind for us. And we have many ideas of how to improve that. And our old DeepMind\u2019s Sparrow language model, which we published a couple of years ago, was an experiment into just how good can we get factuality and rules adherence in these systems. And turns out, we can maybe make it an order of magnitude better, but it sometimes comes at the expense of lucidness or creativity on the part of the language model and therefore usefulness.\n\nSo it\u2019s a bit of a Pareto frontier where, if you improve one dimension, you reduce the capability in another dimension. And ideally, what we want to do in the next phases and the next generations of systems is combine the best of both worlds \u2014 keep the creativity and lucidness and funness of the current systems but improve their factuality and reliability. And we\u2019ve got a long way to go on that. But I can see things improving, and I don\u2019t see any theoretical reason why these systems can\u2019t get to extremely high levels of accuracy and reliability in the next few years.\n\nWhen you\u2019re using the Google Search Generative Experience, do you believe what it says?\n\nI do. I sometimes double-check things, especially in the scientific domain where I\u2019ve had very funny situations where, actually all of these models do this, where you ask them to summarize an area of research, which I think would be super useful if they could do that, and then say, \u201cWell, what are the key papers I should read?\u201d And they come up with very plausible sounding papers with very plausible author lists. But then, when you go and look into it, it turns out that they\u2019re just like the most famous people in that field or the titles from two different papers combined together. But of course, they\u2019re extremely plausible as a collection of words. And I think, there what needs to happen is these systems need to understand that citations and papers and author lists are a unitary block rather than a word-by-word prediction.\n\nThere are interesting cases like that where we need to improve, and there\u2019s something which is, of course, us as wanting to advance the frontiers of science, that\u2019s a particularly interesting use case that we would like to improve and fix \u2014 for our own needs as well. I\u2019d love these systems to better summarize for me \u201chere are the top five papers to read about a particular disease\u201d or something like that to just quickly onboard you in that particular area. I think it would be incredibly useful.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you, I googled my friend John Gruber, and SGE confidently told me that he pioneered the use of a Mac in newspapers and invented WebKit. I don\u2019t know where that came from. Is there a quality level, a truthfulness level that you need to hit before you roll that out to the mass audience?\n\nYeah, we think about this all the time, especially at Google because of the incredibly high standards Google holds itself to on things like search and that we all rely on every day and every moment of every day, really, and we want to get toward that level of reliability. Obviously, we\u2019re a long, long, long way away from that at the moment with not just us but anybody with their generative systems. But that\u2019s the gold standard. And actually, things like tool use can come in very handy here where you could, in effect, build these systems so that they fact-check themselves, perhaps even using search or other reliable sources, cross-reference, just like a good researcher would, cross-reference your facts. Also having a better understanding of the world. What are research papers? What entities are they?\n\nSo these systems need to have a better understanding of the media they\u2019re dealing with. And maybe also give these systems the ability to reason and plan because then they could potentially turn that on their own outputs and critique themselves. And again, this is something we have a lot of experience in in games programs. They don\u2019t just output the first move that you think of in chess or Go. You actually plan and do some search around that and then back up. And sometimes they change their minds and switch to a better move. And you could imagine some process like that with words and language as well.\n\nThere\u2019s the concept of model collapse. That we\u2019re going to train LLMs on LLM-generated data, and that\u2019s going to go into a circle. When you talk about cross-referencing facts, and I think about Google \u2014 Google going out in the web and trying to cross-reference a bunch of stuff but maybe all that stuff has been generated by LLMs that were hallucinating in 2023. How do you guard against that?\n\nWe are working on some pretty cool solutions to that. I think the answer is, and this is an answer to deepfakes as well, is to do some encrypted watermarking, sophisticated watermarking, that can\u2019t be removed easily or at all, and it\u2019s probably built into the generative models themselves, so it\u2019s part of the generative process. We hope to release that and maybe provide it to third parties as well as a generic solution. But I think that the industry in the field needs those types of solutions where we can mark generated media, be that images, audio, perhaps even text with some Kitemark that says to the user and future AI systems that these were AI-generated. And I think that\u2019s a very, very pressing need right now for near-term issues with AI like deepfakes and disinformation and so on. But I actually think a solution is on the horizon now.\n\nI had Microsoft CTO and EVP of AI Kevin Scott on the show a few weeks ago. He said something very similar.

A few ways include watermarking, metadata, and other tools to let users know where something, such as an image, originates.\n\nThese companies are also tasked with researching the risks to society AI systems pose, such as \"harmful bias, discrimination, and protecting privacy.\"\n\n(Image credit: Android Central)\n\nNext, companies must continuously report about their AI systems publically so everyone, including the government and others in the industry, can understand where they're at on a security and societal risk factor level. Developing AI to help solve healthcare issues and environmental changes is included on the commitment list.\n\nSecurity is another hot topic, and as the White House's fact sheet states, all seven companies are to invest in cybersecurity measures and \"insider threat protocols\" to protect proprietary and unreleased model weights. The latter has been deemed to be the most important when going about developing the right security protocols for AI systems.\n\nCompanies are also required to facilitate third-party discovery and report any vulnerabilities within their systems.\n\n(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)\n\nAll of this must be done before companies can roll out new AI systems to the public, the White House states. The seven companies need to conduct internal and external security tests of their AI systems before release. Additionally, information needs to be shared across the industry, the government, civil society, and academia about best practices for safety and other such threats to their systems.\n\nSafety and comfort with artificial intelligence are required as companies such as Google have warned their employees to exercise caution when using AI chatbots over security concerns. That's not the first instance of such fear as Samsung had quite the scare when an engineer accidentally submitted confidential company code to an AI chatbot.\n\nLastly, Google voluntarily committing to advancing safe AI practices along with several others comes two months after it joined with the EU for a similar agreement. The company collaborated to create the \"AI Pact,\" a new set of guidelines companies in the region were urged to voluntarily agree to get a handle on AI software before it goes too far.", "tiktoken_token_count": 623, "llama_token_count": 748}, {"source_name": "Android Central", "author": "tips@androidcentral.com (Vishnu Sarangapurkar)", "title": "ChatGPT for Android is going live next week as Google Play Store listing appears", "description": "The standalone ChatGPT app debuted on iOS in May and is coming to Android next week.", "url": "https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-app-going-live-for-android-next-week", "text": "What you need to know\n\nAndroid owners can start installing ChatGPT on their devices beginning next week.\n\nWith over half a million installs on iOS, the ability to get installed on Android will likely boost the number.\n\nThe primary features during rollout include Instant answers, Tailored advice, Creative Inspiration, and more.\n\nAfter debuting to iOS in May, the standalone ChatGPT app is all set to land on Android devices next week, OpenAI announced.

The agreement, he said, would underscore three fundamental principles \u2013 safety, security and trust.\n\nThe White House said seven US companies had agreed to the voluntary commitments, which are meant to ensure their AI products are safe before they release them.\n\nThe announcement comes as critics charge AI\u2019s breakneck expansion threatens to allow real damage to occur before laws catch up. The voluntary commitments are not legally binding, but may create a stopgap while more comprehensive action is developed.\n\nA surge of commercial investment in generative AI tools that can write convincingly human-like text and churn out new images and other media has brought public fascination as well as concern about their ability to trick people and spread disinformation, among other dangers.\n\nThe tech companies agreed to eight measures:\n\nUsing watermarking on audio and visual content to help identify content generated by AI.\n\nAllowing independent experts to try to push models into bad behavior \u2013 a process known as \u201cred-teaming\u201d.\n\nSharing trust and safety information with the government and other companies.\n\nInvesting in cybersecurity measures.\n\nEncouraging third parties to uncover security vulnerabilities.\n\nReporting societal risks such as inappropriate uses and bias.\n\nPrioritizing research on AI\u2019s societal risks.\n\nUsing the most cutting-edge AI systems, known as frontier models, to solve society\u2019s greatest problems.\n\nThe voluntary commitments are meant to be an immediate way of addressing risks ahead of a longer-term push to get Congress to pass laws regulating the technology.\n\nSome advocates for AI regulations said Biden\u2019s move is a start but more needs to be done to hold the companies and their products accountable.\n\n\u201cHistory would indicate that many tech companies do not actually walk the walk on a voluntary pledge to act responsibly and support strong regulations,\u201d said a statement from James Steyer, founder and CEO of the non-profit Common Sense Media.\n\nThe guidelines, as detailed at a high level in a fact sheet the White House released, some critics have argued, do not go far enough in addressing concerns over the way AI could impact society and give the administration little to no remedies for enforcement if the companies do not abide by them. \u201cWe need a much more wide-ranging public deliberation and that\u2019s going to bring up issues that companies almost certainly won\u2019t voluntarily commit to because it would lead to substantively different results, ones that may more directly impact their business models,\u201d said Amba Kak, the executive director of research group the AI Now Institute.\n\n\u201cA closed-door deliberation with corporate actors resulting in voluntary safeguards isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Kak said. \u201cWhat this list covers is a set of problems that are comfortable to business as usual, but we also need to be looking at what\u2019s not on the list \u2013 things like competition concerns, discriminatory impacts of these systems. The companies have said they\u2019ll \u2018research\u2019 privacy and bias, but we already have robust bodies of research on both \u2013 what we need is accountability.\u201d\n\nVoluntary guidelines amount to little more than self-regulation, said Caitriona Fitzgerald, the deputy director at the non-profit research group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic). A similar approach was taken with social media platforms, she said, and it didn\u2019t work. \u201cIt\u2019s internal compliance checking and it\u2019s similar to what we\u2019ve seen in the FTC consent orders from the past when they required Facebook to do internal privacy impact assessments and they just became a box-checking exercise.\u201d\n\nThe Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has said he will introduce legislation to regulate AI. He has held a number of briefings with government officials to educate senators about an issue that\u2019s attracted bipartisan interest.\n\nA number of technology executives have called for regulation, and several went to the White House in May to speak with Biden, vice-president Kamala Harris and other officials.\n\nSenator Mark Warner said the guidelines released on Friday are a start but that \u201cwe need more than industry commitments\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile we often hear AI vendors talk about their commitment to security and safety, we have repeatedly seen the expedited release of products that are exploitable, prone to generating unreliable outputs, and susceptible to misuse,\u201d Warner said in a statement.\n\nBut some experts and upstart competitors worry that the type of regulation being floated could be a boon for deep-pocketed first-movers led by OpenAI, Google and Microsoft, as smaller players are elbowed out by the high cost of making their AI systems known as large language models adhere to regulatory strictures.\n\nThe software trade group BSA, which includes Microsoft as a member, said on Friday that it welcomed the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to set rules for high-risk AI systems.\n\n\u201cEnterprise software companies look forward to working with the administration and Congress to enact legislation that addresses the risks associated with artificial intelligence and promote its benefits,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nSeveral countries have been looking at ways to regulate AI, including European Union lawmakers who have been negotiating sweeping AI rules for the 27-country bloc.\n\nThe details of the European legislation are still being hashed out, but the EU AI Act contains robust regulations that would create significant consumer protections against the overreach, privacy violations and biases of certain types of high-risk AI models.\n\nMeanwhile conversations in the US remain in the early stages. Fitzgerald, of Epic, said while the voluntary guidelines are just one in a series of guidelines the White House has released on AI, she worries it might cause Congress to slow down their push to create regulations. \u201cWe need the rules of the road before it gets too big to regulate,\u201d she said.\n\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, recently said the United Nations was \u201cthe ideal place\u201d to adopt global standards and appointed a board that will report back on options for global AI governance by the end of the year.\n\nThe United Nations chief also said he welcomed calls from some countries for the creation of a new UN body to support global efforts to govern AI, inspired by such models as the International Atomic Energy Agency or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nThe White House said on Friday that it had already consulted on the voluntary commitments with a number of countries.\n\nAssociated Press contributed to this story", "tiktoken_token_count": 1386, "llama_token_count": 1721}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Heather Stewart", "title": "\u2018We have to flip the AI debate towards hope\u2019: Labour\u2019s techno-optimist, Darren Jones", "description": "The chair of the Commons business select committee is a firm believer that technology is a force for good and should be central to his party\u2019s plans to transform the UK\u2018It\u2019s an upgrade.

In the same way as you upgrade your iPhone, we need to upgrade Britain.\u201d Labour MP Darren Jones believes artificial intelligence will bring an economic change on the scale of the industrial revolution, which politicians must be ready to shape.\n\nAs chair of the business and trade select committee, the ambitious 36-year-old backbencher, who represents Bristol North West, has built a reputation for himself in Westminster as a tough interrogator.\n\nWith speculation raging last week about the future of Thames Water, he took to the airwaves to criticise the way the heavily indebted sector has been regulated, saying he was \u201cincreasingly sick\u201d of its failures.\n\nHowever, Jones is at his most animated when talking about AI. He has clashed with company bosses over their use of technology to monitor and control staff \u2013 including at Amazon and Royal Mail. But he is an evangelist for the upsides of innovation, including the arrival of large language models (LLMs) such as the hit dialogue-based AI software ChatGPT.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we flip this debate. Lots of people will have started to hear about AI and human extinction and job losses, and they will associate it with anxiety or fear,\u201d the MP says.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not going to get widespread adoption of technology in the economy unless people want to use it. So we have to flip the debate towards hope \u2013 hope of better pay, better work, better public services.\u201d\n\nHe believes the potential productivity improvements that could be available \u2013 if the technology is adopted in the right way \u2013 could help drag the UK out of the economic doldrums.\n\nJones thinks there is a distinctive Labour approach here, which involves embracing AI while setting clear constraints on how it is adopted in order to protect workers, and making training and support available to help those affected to transition to new jobs.\n\n\u201cThe state should be in there making the case: we welcome this technology, we want to adopt it \u2013 but there are certain requirements, about the social impact, about privacy, about security, about equality, that we will guarantee as part of that process,\u201d he says. Jones made similar points in a House of Commons debate on AI last week.\n\nKeir Starmer made his own view clear earlier this month, with the Labour leader warning that the country was at an \u201cinflection point\u201d, and if the adoption of AI was not well managed, the consequences could mirror the de-industrialisation of the 1980s.\n\nRishi Sunak\u2019s government has until recently appeared to favour a laissez-faire stance, using its AI white paper to hail the benefits of the technology, but the prime minister has since highlighted some of the potential risks and will be hosting a global \u201cAI safety\u201d summit in the autumn.\n\nJones argues the catastrophic risks recently raised by some of the AI sector\u2019s leading figures could, with political will, be relatively easily managed. Only a small number of tech giants have access to the massive computing power it needs, he says, so that \u201cit\u2019s quite easy in terms of oversight \u2013 sharing of information, collaboration, maybe a bit about licensing access to these very sophisticated computers\u201d.\n\nWe should not be talking about AI, we should be talking about improving the quality of education for our kids, or clearing the backlogs in the NHS \u2013 and making the case that all of that is delivered through technology\n\nAs a former technology lawyer, he is critical of the AI act recently approved by the European parliament, which he believes could stifle innovation. However, he also warns against the no-holds-barred approach of the US. \u201cI \u2026 don\u2019t think the European approach is in the interests of Britain, and I think we can carve out a third way,\u201d he says.\n\nThat phrase, resonant of Tony Blair in his prime, may be telling. Jones was swept into Westminster in the summer of 2017, when Jeremy Corbyn wiped out Theresa May\u2019s majority and took Glastonbury by storm, but he is no Corbynista.\n\nHigh on a shelf in his Westminster office is a snap of him sporting a red rosette, standing proudly outside the council flat in Lawrence Weston, Bristol, where he grew up, in the area he now represents. In his maiden speech, he pointed out that he was the first Darren ever elected to the Commons.\n\nJones says the policies of Blair\u2019s 1997 Labour government transformed his life. The national minimum wage boosted the pay of both his parents \u2013 his dad was a security guard and his mum an NHS administrator.\n\nHis secondary school was one of the worst-performing in the country but he took part in Labour\u2019s Young, Gifted and Talented programme for bright kids in state schools, which helped him to get a place at Plymouth University. \u201cI got to go to university because the government put it in front of me,\u201d he says, bluntly.\n\nWhile not promising that things can only get better, as per Blair\u2019s 1997 election anthem, he does believe a heavy dose of techno-optimism should be central to Labour\u2019s pitch.\n\n\u201cIt should be, in my view, at the heart of our plan to transform the country, and at the heart of our political vision \u2013 but you would have to anchor it in people\u2019s concerns and experiences,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe should not be talking about AI, we should be talking about improving the quality of education for our kids, or clearing the backlogs in the NHS, or getting people better jobs \u2013 and making the case that all of that is delivered through technology.\u201d\n\nHe believes the state\u2019s role is not to try to impose technological solutions from Whitehall, but provide what he calls \u201ccore, central digital infrastructure\u201d and then build an \u201cecosystem\u201d that encourages and rewards innovation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be announcing hundred-million-quid, top-down transformation programmes of public services, because traditionally they\u2019ve always failed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has to be bottom-up-led innovation.\u201d\n\nAfter Sunak\u2019s recent departmental rejig, science and technology are no longer under the aegis of Jones\u2019s committee, formerly known as the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, which now covers business and trade. Asked if he might fancy a position on Starmer\u2019s frontbench \u2013 perhaps in the as-yet-unfilled role of shadow secretary of state for science and technology \u2013 Jones says he\u2019s not lobbying for a job. But he admits: \u201cIf Keir asked me to do something, then of course I would say yes, because I want the party to win and I would be delighted to be a part of securing that.\u201d\n\nCV\n\nAge 36\n\nFamily \u201cWife, two children, third on the way.

According to strike guidance, members will not be able to attend premieres, do interviews for completed work, attend award shows or film festivals, or promote projects on social media while the strike is in effect.\n\nThe strike canceled the New York red-carpet premiere of Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan\u2019s biopic about the creator of the atomic bomb. On Thursday, the film\u2019s cast, including Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon, left the film\u2019s London premiere early, when the strike was called. (Damon told Deadline that the strike will affect his new production company founded with Ben Affleck.) The cast of this month\u2019s other hotly anticipated film, Greta Gerwig\u2019s Barbie, also wrapped its promotional campaign early. \u201cI very much am in support of all the unions and I\u2019m a part of Sag, so I would absolutely stand by them,\u201d the film\u2019s lead, Margot Robbie, told reporters at the London premiere.\n\n02:05 Hollywood actors walk out of Oppenheimer premiere as strike action starts \u2013 video report\n\nOne of the first major productions affected was Deadpool 3, which paused filming on Thursday as the strike got under way, only days after Marvel revealed a first look at the set with photos of the stars Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman costumed as Deadpool and Wolverine, respectively. As the script was already locked, Deadpool 3 was able to continue production during the writers\u2019 strike. But the film\u2019s original May 2024 release date now seems in jeopardy due to the production halt, a sign of the Hollywood stasis to come.\n\nHBO\u2019s blockbuster series House of the Dragon, however, will continue filming in the UK due to local union rules, as first reported by Variety. The majority of the actors on the Game of Thrones prequel, currently filming its second season, are from the UK and thus under contracts governed by the UK local union, Equity. The series is technically allowed to continue filming as Equity members are not legally permitted to strike in solidarity with US actors. In strike guidance provided by Equity hours before Sag-Aftra officially declared a walkout, the union, the 12th largest trade organization in the UK, said it would \u201csupport Sag-Aftra and its members by all lawful means\u201d.\n\nA strike could also torpedo major summer and fall film festivals, which are now in wait-and-see mode. Glitzy photo opportunity-oriented festivals like Venice, which is set to begin on 30 August, could be held without major Hollywood stars. The Toronto film festival, held in September, said in a statement to Deadline on Thursday that organizers will \u201ccontinue planning for this year\u2019s festival with the hope of a swift resolution in the coming weeks\u201d.\n\nBroadway will remain open, as Sag-Aftra does not represent stage actors. But on Friday, the president of Actors\u2019 Equity, which represents stage actors and stage managers, urged members to \u201cproactively and aggressively avoid breaking\u201d the Sag-Aftra strike by inadvertently crossing the picket line. The guild president, Kate Shindle, encouraged members to contact Sag-Aftra with any questions about potentially struck work, and added: \u201cKnow this: the other side will try to pit us against each other to keep churning out content. Don\u2019t fall for it.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the negotiations is what many members have referred to as an existential question over the future of AI in replacing writers or generating unapproved likenesses of actors, among other concerns. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) said it offered a \u201cgroundbreaking AI proposal which protects performers\u2019 digital likenesses, including a requirement for performer\u2019s consent for the creation and use of digital replicas or for digital alterations of a performance\u201d. But Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, Sag-Aftra\u2019s chief negotiator and national executive director, denounced that proposal on Thursday for only paying background performers for one day of work in exchange for the rights to their digital likeness \u201cfor the rest of eternity with no compensation\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf you think that\u2019s a groundbreaking proposal, I suggest you think again,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the hours after the strike was called, numerous Hollywood stars, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Bob Odenkirk, Cynthia Nixon, Sheryl Lee Ralph and Josh Gad, expressed public support for the dual work stoppages.\n\nGeorge Clooney has also backed the strike, and said in a statement on Friday that \u201cactors and writers in large numbers have lost their ability to make a living\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is an inflection point in our industry,\u201d he said. \u201cFor our industry to survive that has to change.

Here are some details in each of those categories:\n\nSafety: The companies agreed to \"testing the safety and capabilities of their AI systems, subjecting them to external testing, assessing their potential biological, cybersecurity, and societal risks and making the results of those assessments public.\"\n\nSecurity: The companies also said they will safeguard their AI products \"against cyber and insider threats\" and share \"best practices and standards to prevent misuse, reduce risks to society, and protect national security.\"\n\nTrust: One of the biggest agreements secured was for these companies to make it easy for people to tell whether images are original, altered or generated by AI. They will also ensure that AI doesn't promote discrimination or bias, they will protect children from harm, and will use AI to solve challenges like climate change and cancer.\n\nThe arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022 was the beginning of a stampede of major tech companies releasing generative AI tools to the masses. OpenAI's GPT-4 launched in mid-March. It's the latest version of the large language model that powers the ChatGPT AI chatbot, which among other things is advanced enough to pass the bar exam. Chatbots, however, are prone to spitting out incorrect answers and sometimes sources that don't exist. As adoption of these tools has exploded, their potential problems have gained renewed attention -- including spreading misinformation and deepening bias and inequality.\n\nWhat the AI companies are saying and doing\n\nMeta said it welcomed the White House agreement. Earlier this week, the company launched the second generation of its AI large language model, Llama 2, making it free and open source.\n\n\"As we develop new AI models, tech companies should be transparent about how their systems work and collaborate closely across industry, government, academia and civil society,\" said Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs.\n\nThe White House agreement will \"create a foundation to help ensure the promise of AI stays ahead of its risks,\" Brad Smith, Microsoft vice chair and president, said in a blog post.\n\nMicrosoft is a partner on Meta's Llama 2. It also launched AI-powered Bing search earlier this year that makes use of ChatGPT and is bringing more and more AI tools to Microsoft 365 and its Edge browser.\n\nThe agreement with the White House is part of OpenAI's \"ongoing collaboration with governments, civil society organizations and others around the world to advance AI governance,\" said Anna Makanju, OpenAI vice president of global affairs. \"Policymakers around the world are considering new laws for highly capable AI systems. Today's commitments contribute specific and concrete practices to that ongoing discussion.\"\n\nAmazon is in support of the voluntary commitments \"as one of the world's leading developers and deployers of AI tools and services,\" Tim Doyle, Amazon spokesperson, told CNET in an emailed statement. \"We are dedicated to driving innovation on behalf of our customers while also establishing and implementing the necessary safeguards to protect consumers and customers.\"\n\nAmazon has leaned into AI for its podcasts and music and on Amazon Web Services.\n\nAnthropic said in an emailed statement that all AI companies \"need to join in a race for AI safety.\" The company said it will announce its plans in the coming weeks on \"cybersecurity, red teaming and responsible scaling.\"\n\n\"There's a huge amount of safety work ahead. So far AI safety has been stuck in the space of ideas and meetings,\" Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder and CEO of Inflection AI, wrote in a blog post Friday. \"The amount of tangible progress versus hype and panic has been insufficient. At Inflection we find this both concerning and frustrating. That's why safety is at the heart of our mission.\"\n\nWhat else?\n\n\"Today is a milestone in bringing the industry together to ensure that AI helps everyone,\" said Kent Walker, Google's President of Global Affairs, in a blog post later Friday. \"These commitments will support efforts by the G7, the OECD, and national governments to maximize AI's benefits and minimize its risks.\"\n\nGoogle, which launched a chatbot called Bard in March, previously said it would watermark AI content. The company's AI model Gemini will identify text, images and footage that have been generated by AI. It will check the metadata integrated in content to let you know what's unaltered and what's been created by AI.\n\nImage software company Adobe is similarly ensuring it's tagging AI-generated images from its Firefly AI tools with metadata indicating they've been created by an AI system.\n\nElon Musk's new AI company xAI wasn't part of the discussion Friday, and Apple also appeared to be absent amid reports it has created its own chatbot and large language model framework.\n\nYou can read the entire voluntary agreement between the companies and the White House here. It follows more than 1,000 people in tech, including Musk, signing an open letter in March urging labs to take at least a six-month pause in AI development due to \"profound risks\" to society from increasingly capable AI engines. In June, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, along with other scientists and notable figures, also signed a statement warning of the risks of AI. And Microsoft in May released a 40-page report saying AI regulation is needed to stay ahead of potential risks and bad actors.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration is also developing an executive order and seeking bipartisan legislation \"to keep Americans safe\" from AI. The US Office of Management and Budget is additionally slated to release guidelines for any federal agencies that are procuring or using AI systems.\n\nSee also: ChatGPT vs. Bing vs. Google Bard: Which AI Is the Most Helpful?\n\nEditors' note: CNET is using an AI engine to help create some stories.

A coalition of tech giants and startups pledged Friday to watermark content produced by AI.\n\nThe group \u2014 comprised of Big Tech pillars Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, as well as generative AI bastions OpenAI, Anthropic, and Inflection \u2014 made \"voluntary commitments\" to the Biden administration in the effort to make their products safer and tamp down on the technology's tendency to perpetuate biases and produce misinformation, according to a statement from the White House on Friday.\n\nThe pledge included commitments for the companies to make \"robust systems\" that identify or watermark content produced by their AI tools. These identifiers or watermarks would distinguish which AI service was used to generate the content, but omit any information that could be used to identify the original user.\n\nSince OpenAI's release of ChatGPT last November, generative AI tools have dazzled users with their ability to conjure up text and images when prompted. But the emerging technology's power to produce cogent text and photorealistic images has already been used to disseminate false information.\n\nIn May, markets dropped briefly after a fake image of the Pentagon shrouded in smoke circulated on social media. The picture was never confirmed to be created using AI but contained many unrealistic elements that occasionally crop up in AI-generated images, such as physical objects blending into each other.\n\nA political ad released Tuesday in support of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis reportedly used AI to replicate Donald Trump's voice and create a soundbite that never actually occurred. This comes a month after another DeSantis ad featured an image of Trump hugging and kissing Anthony Fauci, the White House's former chief medical advisor, which experts told AFP was likely AI-generated.\n\nA study published in June found that a majority of people were unable to tell whether a tweet was written by a human or by ChatGPT. The participants surveyed even found ChatGPT-tweets more convincing than their human counterparts.\n\nWhen contacted for comment by Insider, several of the companies who made the agreement with the White House pointed to their recent statements on the partnership, in which many referenced upcoming collaborations that will allow them to follow through on the commitments. Meta and Inflection did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.\n\nIn a blog post on the agreement, Google directly referenced its ongoing efforts to integrate watermarking, as well as to develop its \"About this image\" tool, which would allow users to identify where an image originated online and whether its been featured on fact-checking sites or news publications.\n\nInflection, the studio behind the personal AI chatbot named \"Pi,\" said in a blog post about the agreement that \"the project of making truly safe and trustworthy AI is still only in its earliest phase.\"\n\n\"We see this as simply a springboard and catalyst for doing more,\" Inflection added.\n\nThe growing anxiety around how to spot fake content has incentivized many AI startups to develop tools that vet whether a piece of content was produced by a human or AI.

While the rollout of Microsoft CoPilot could drive significant revenue growth for the company going forward, it will take some time for that opportunity to be fully realized.\n\nHere's how Wall Street is reacting to Microsoft's most recent earnings report.\n\nWedbush: \"AI Momentum building in Redmond.\"\n\n\"The stock sold off modestly as Nadella and Co. commented that the AI ramp will be 'gradual' in FY24 which is not a surprise to the Street as FY25 remains the true inflection year of AI growth with pricing, beta customers, and use cases all being rolled out over the next three to six months,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said. \"We believe Microsoft is in the early innings of a massive penetration of AI and cloud that could conservatively approach 50% of its global installed base over the next 3 year.\n\nIves reiterated his \"Outperform\" rating and raised his price target to $400 from $375.\n\nBank of America: \"AI investment justified given opportunity.\"\n\n\"Though Azure growth was below our upside case, we view the high end of the guidance as solid in an environment where optimization headwinds do not appear to be abating.

Commentary for a more meaningful AI tailwind to H2 growth suggests that the AI-enabled M365 Copilot offering is likely to begin contributing in that time frame. In summary, AI offerings are expected to contribute meaningfully for both Azure and Office,\" Bank of America said.\n\nBank of America reiterated its \"Buy\" rating $405 price target.\n\nJPMorgan: \"A multi-year trend rather than an instantaneous flip of a switch.\"\n\n\"We have been consistent in our view that generative AI is the seminal technological breakthrough of our generation and one that will likely play out over years to come. To the latter point, we cautioned investors that that process of translating early demand to large-scale implementations and recognized revenue will be a multi-year trend rather than an instantaneous flip of a switch.

The bubble is evidenced by the fact that stock concentration in the S&P 500 is at 60-year highs, as the top seven companies make up more than 25% of the index.\n\nThat concentration was particularly strong in the Nasdaq 100, which was recently forced to undergo a special rebalance after the mega-cap tech companies made up more than 50% of the index.\n\n\"This could be indicative of a bubble, and other anecdotal evidences point to an AI-driven bubble as well,\" Kolanovic said.\n\nHe is a believer in AI technologies but doesn't think they're ready for prime time in their current form as chatbots, given that they \"often fail in basic questions and occasionally fabricate wrong answers to more complex questions.\"\n\nWhile the AI bubble keeps raging on, Kolanovic is focused on three bearish catalysts that could ultimately upend the stock market rally and lead to a sizeable sell-off.\n\n\"We remain of the view that the delayed impact of the global interest rate shock, steady erosion of consumer savings and post-COVID pent-up demand, and deeply troubling global geopolitical context will result in market declines and re-emergence of market volatility,\" he said.\n\nWhile admitting there's no way to time the potential negative inflection point for markets, Kolanovic said \"there are not data points that would prompt us to change our methodology or conclusions.\"\n\nHe recommends investors purchase commodities, as they \"stand out as under-valued, under-owned, and [are] backed by compelling fundamentals and technicals,\" according to the note.\n\nKolanovic isn't the only bearish Wall Street strategist who is sticking to his view that stocks are likely to fall.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Mike Wilson said on Monday that he was wrong about his bearish stance, but he reiterated a bearish price target outlook for the S&P 500 and said cooling inflation could hurt stock prices.\n\nBoth strategists have been bearish for much of the stock market rally that began late last year.", "tiktoken_token_count": 609, "llama_token_count": 769}, {"source_name": "Business Insider", "author": "Vishal Persaud", "title": "Meet the contrarian VC: Why Mayfield's Navin Chaddha is writing more checks than ever before while other investors pull back", "description": "Mayfield is nearly doubling its investing pace this year with a keen interest in AI startups, while other firms are pulling back.", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/why-mayfield-doing-more-startup-investments-focusing-ai-2023-7", "text": "Mayfield is nearly doubling its investing pace this year, while other firms are pulling back.\n\nThe longtime VC firm just announced a new $250 million seed fund focused on AI.\n\nIn tough economic times, the firm's leader, Navin Chaddha, believes it's a prime time to invest.\n\nMorning Brew Insider recommends waking up with, a daily newsletter.

That has essentially been Navin Chaddha's mantra since he took over the reins at venture-capital stalwart Mayfield Fund in 2009.\n\nSince then, Mayfield's bar to make a deal with a startup has been incredibly high. On average, of the thousands of companies it meets with annually, Mayfield only makes investments in about 0.4% of them. That's lower than the acceptance rate of startup accelerator Y Combinator, which accepts around 1.5% to 2% of companies that apply for its program.\n\nBut it's a strategy that's worked for Mayfield, helping it deliver consistent returns for its LPs, and a big part of the reason why that prudence has made its LPs continue to commit capital for the firm's funds. Earlier this year, the firm announced a total fundraise of $955 million for two new funds \u2014 its biggest fundraise thus far \u2014 and recently announced a new $250 million AI-focused fund that will draw from the firm's current funds and the new capital raised.\n\nThat's in stark contrast to many VCs and their firms like Tiger Global, TCV and Insight Partners, which are tempering their lofty fundraising goals by lowering their targets.\n\nThe fresh capital has put Mayfield in a position to lean in and do more investments than it typically does. The firm does about eight investments per year and when markets get too frothy, Mayfield actually pulls back on investing \u2013 like it did in 2021 when it only invested in seven new startups, Chaddha said. But now that the market has been on shaky footing the past year with talks of a looming recession, Mayfield's leader, Navin Chaddha, says the firm is probably on pace to do up to 15 new investments this year. Last year, when most of the venture industry pulled back on funding startups, Mayfield made 12 new investments.\n\n\"So that's what we do, when things get out of whack, and the whole industry follows this way, we follow that way. We are just contrarian,\" Chaddha said.\n\nAnd the timing really couldn't be better for Mayfield, as the hype in AI \u2013 particularly generative AI \u2013 has hit an apex in the VC industry.\n\n\"We think this is the time to lean in,\" Chaddha said.\n\nThe Mayfield leader \u2013 who's made successful bets on companies like Hashicorp, Lyft and Poshmark, and has been featured on Forbes' Midas list almost every year he's been at the helm of the firm \u2013 firmly believes that the greatest companies are created during tough economic times.\n\nThat's what makes the current period such an enticing time to invest in new companies, particularly in AI. These companies could usher in the next wave of tech dominance. Mayfield is actually doubling-down on that assertion with its new AI-focused seed fund, and hiring expert industry investor, Vijay Reddy, to head it up. Reddy focused on AI at Clear Ventures and before that, at Intel Capital, making investments in companies like Sambanova, DataRobot and Joby.\n\nChaddha told Forbes that he was interested in a wide range of AI companies, from application software to semiconductors, while Reddy said he was excited about co-piloted AI applications, which keep humans as part of the decision making process, and companies building AI trust and safety infrastructure tools.\n\nMayfield's new AI focus comes amid an inflection point for the venture-capital industry. Many saw this AI wave coming, while others are now trying to catch up. Over the past few months, several firms have announced new AI-focused funds or set aside capital to focus on the sector: Wing Venture Capital just closed a $600 million fund, Bessemer earmarked $1 billion, and Sequoia is now pulling out all the stops to get in on AI startup investments.\n\nFor years, Mayfield had kept tabs on AI startups like MindsDB, which was relatively unknown and cast aside by some investors just five to six years ago. But once the startup began to get investor interest, Mayfield was ready to pounce and make an investment. With a dedicated $250 million AI seed war chest, Mayfield is now prepared to lean in even more.\n\n\"We believe that AI will emerge as our teammate and that the Gen.AI wave will create many iconic companies,\" Chaddha said in a press release.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1040, "llama_token_count": 1251}, {"source_name": "ReadWrite", "author": "Brad Anderson", "title": "AI Companies Make \u2018Voluntary\u2019 Safety Commitments at the White House", "description": "Concerns about the potential risks and lack of transparency in the rapidly expanding field of artificial intelligence (AI) have prompted [\u2026]\nThe post AI Companies Make \u2018Voluntary\u2019 Safety Commitments at the White House appeared first on ReadWrite.", "url": "https://readwrite.com/ai-companies-make-voluntary-safety-commitments-at-the-white-house/", "text": "Concerns about the potential risks and lack of transparency in the rapidly expanding field of artificial intelligence (AI) have prompted the Biden administration to take action. To address these issues, the White House has convened seven of the most prominent AI developers to discuss common goals of safety and openness. The voluntary pledges made by these businesses are nonetheless seen as a positive development towards the establishment of regulations and guidelines for the AI industry.\n\nRepresentatives from the following artificial intelligence companies were present at the White House meeting:\n\nBrad Smith, President of Microsoft; Kent Walker, President, Google; Dario Amodei, CEO, Anthropic; Mustafa Suleyman, CEO, Inflection AI; Nick Clegg, President, Meta; Greg Brockman, President, OpenAI; Adam Selipsky, CEO, Amazon Web Services;\n\nAlthough the AI companies\u2019 pledges are not legally binding, they do show a desire to address the issues that have been raised about AI. The major promises made by the businesses are as follows:\n\nBefore releasing their AI systems to the public, the companies have committed to conducting internal and external security tests. Experts from outside the company can act as an adversarial \u201cred team\u201d to probe for security flaws and threats. Companies using AI have promised to inform policymakers, academics, and members of civil society about the dangers posed by AI and the methods being developed to counteract them. Concerns like preventing unauthorized access or \u201cjailbreaking\u201d of AI systems are among those they hope to address by encouraging collaboration and transparency. The companies will invest in cybersecurity measures, including protections against insider threats, to ensure the privacy of client model data and intellectual property. This is essential to thwart hackers\u2019 attempts to exploit security flaws and steal private data. Through bug bounty programs and/or domain expert analysis, the companies will encourage third-party discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities. This promotes outside inspection, which is useful for discovering vulnerabilities in AI systems. Companies are working on developing reliable watermarking or other methods of marking AI-generated content to ensure accountability and traceability. This is crucial in the fight against disinformation and deepfakes, as it will allow for the identification of the original creator and authenticity of AI-generated content. Companies have pledged to disclose their AI systems\u2019 strengths and weaknesses as well as the contexts in which they should and should not be used. This openness is crucial for preventing misuse of AI and ensuring its responsible deployment. The companies will put a premium on studying the social risks of AI, such as discrimination and invasion of privacy. By identifying and mitigating these threats, they hope to create AI systems that are equitable, apolitical, and protective of individual privacy. The companies will also work on creating and deploying AI to tackle some of society\u2019s biggest problems, like stopping cancer and fixing the climate. The lack of monitoring of AI models\u2019 carbon footprint, however, calls attention to the need for more eco-friendly considerations in AI research and development.\n\nThe AI companies\u2019 pledges are entirely voluntary, but the Biden administration is working on an AI-related Executive Order. In its current form, this order has the potential to promote compliance and set industry standards. The Executive Order could instruct government agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate AI products claiming robust security, for instance, if companies do not permit external security testing of their AI models prior to release.\n\nThe administration\u2019s forward-thinking stance on AI reflects its commitment to avoiding technological pitfalls in the future. Because of the lessons it has learned from social media\u2019s disruptive potential, the government is eager to launch a comprehensive plan for artificial intelligence. Vice President Harris and President Biden have already consulted with business moguls and other influential figures. There has also been a substantial investment in AI research institutions and initiatives.\n\nThe national science and research infrastructure, however, has been ahead of the government in this respect. There is already a comprehensive report outlining the difficulties and potential benefits of AI for science that was compiled by the Department of Energy (DOE) and National Labs.\n\nFinally, the major AI companies\u2019 voluntary commitments made at the White House are a big deal for ensuring safety and transparency in the AI industry. Although the pledges are not legally binding, they do show a commitment to working together, sharing data, and putting an emphasis on ethical AI research and development. There needs to be a middle ground between being innovative and making sure AI is used in a responsible and ethical way.\n\nFirst reported on TechCrunch\n\nFrequently Asked Question\n\nQ.

SAG-AFTRA\u2019s negotiating committee unanimously voted to recommend a strike to its national board, which in turn announced a strike Thursday afternoon.\n\nOn June 5, nearly 65,000 of the approximately 160,000 members that make up SAG-AFTRA approved a strike authorization with a 97.91% \u201cyes\u201d vote. The union includes actors, dancers, DJs, puppeteers, recording artists, singers, stunt performers, voiceover artists, and other media professionals.\n\nTwo days later, SAG-AFTRA entered negotiations on its agreement with the AMPTP, including Amazon/MGM, Apple, NBCUniversal, Disney/ABC/Fox, Netflix, Paramount/CBS, Sony, and Warner Brothers. On June 30, the contracts between the two were extended, expiring at midnight on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere has been a sea change in the entertainment industry, from the proliferation of streaming platforms to the recent explosion of generative AI, and at stake is the ability of our members to make a living,\u201d Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator, said in a letter about the strike authorization referendum. \u201cWe must ensure that new developments in the entertainment industry are not used to devalue or disrespect the performers who bring productions to life.\u201d\n\nMore from TIME\n\nOn Tuesday, SAG-AFTRA agreed to AMPTP\u2019s last-minute request for federal mediation, which would bring in a neutral third party to help work toward a compromise. SAG-AFTRA clarified, though, that it would not extend the negotiations for a second time.\n\n\u201cWe will not be distracted from negotiating in good faith to secure a fair and just deal by the expiration of our agreement,\u201d the guild said in a press release. \u201cWe are committed to the negotiating process and will explore and exhaust every possible opportunity to make a deal, however we are not confident that the employers have any intention of bargaining toward an agreement.\u201d\n\nAmong SAG-AFTRA\u2019s demands are increased minimum pay rates, increased streaming residuals (neither of which have kept up with inflation), and improved working conditions.

If we don\u2019t stand tall right now, we are all going to be in trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines and big business who care more about Wall Street than you and your family.\u201d\n\nThe union will not accept \u201cincremental changes on a contract that no longer honors what is happening right now with this business model that was foisted upon us,\u201d Drescher said, adding: \u201cWhat are we doing\u2026 moving around furniture on the Titanic? It\u2019s crazy. So the jig is up AMPTP.\u201d\n\nWho is in SAG-AFTRA?\n\nPerformers and media professionals become eligible for membership in SAG-AFTRA by completing a full day of union work in a principal or speaking role, completing three days of union work as a background actor, or being employed under an affiliated performers\u2019 union.\n\nMembers of a number of affiliated unions\u2014AEA, ACTRA, AGMA or AGVA\u2014are eligible for SAG-AFTRA membership after one year (and one principal contract) under their own union\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nFor projects filmed overseas, U.K. acting union Equity issued a joint statement with SAG-AFTRA on Thursday saying that it \u201cwill support SAG-AFTRA and its members by all lawful means.\u201d\n\n\u201cEquity U.K. stands in unwavering solidarity with SAG-AFTRA and its members in their effort to achieve a fair and equitable contract, and for the good of performers working around the world,\u201d the statement read.\n\nHowever, due to \u201cexisting anti-trade union laws,\u201d U.K. actors who are working under contracts governed by Equity are not legally allowed to strike in solidarity with the U.S. union. \u201cSAG-AFTRA members currently working under an Equity U.K. collective bargaining agreement should continue to report to work,\u201d the statement read.\n\nWhen was the last time SAG-AFTRA went on strike?\n\nSAG-AFTRA has a long history of strikes and boycotts. In 2021, the union barred Donald Trump from ever rejoining because he obstructed the peaceful transfer of power to Joe Biden\u2014and because of his attacks on journalists. (Trump had resigned from the group earlier that month.)\n\nIn 2018, SAG-AFTRA announced a strike against the global advertising agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty after the advertising agency stated that it would no longer honor its long-standing contract with the union. Ten months later, the advertising agency agreed to sign SAG-AFTRA\u2019s new commercials contract.\n\nSAG and AFTRA, which merged in 2012, went on strike together for the first time in 2016, against eleven American video game developers and publishers, which became the longest strike within SAG.\n\nIn 2000, before they merged, SAG and AFTRA issued a controversial six-month work stoppage over the protocol for paying actors who appear in TV commercials. Twenty years prior, SAG and AFTRA jointly called for a successful boycott against 1980s\u2019 Emmy Awards, striking for an increase in minimum salaries.\n\nHow the ongoing writers\u2019 strike factors in\n\nIn 1960, SAG went on strike against AMPTP over pay, joining the Writers Guild of America (WGA), which had already been on strike for more than a month with similar demands, largely over pay rates. That marked the first industry-wide strike in Hollywood.\n\nIn a historical echo, today, the WGA has been on strike since early May. If SAG-AFTRA\u2019s demands are not met this time around, it will join the WGA on strike, bringing Hollywood to a near standstill. In preparation, SAG-AFTRA has called for volunteers to serve as strike captains, and WGA captains\u2014already on strike at several studios\u2014have offered training from the picket lines.\n\nRead More: How the Writers Strike Will Affect Your Favorite Shows\n\nWhat this means for movies and TV shows\n\nIf SAG-AFTRA members do go on strike, any film or TV production that has not already been halted by the WGA strike will essentially shut down. Overseas productions, in particular, where studios have tried to continue shooting some shows without WGA writer-producers, are likely to feel the impact.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1734, "llama_token_count": 2102}, {"source_name": "ABC News", "author": "Molly Nagle", "title": "Biden White House, tech companies launch new safeguards around emerging AI technology", "description": "Seven major companies are taking voluntary steps on security and transparency.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-white-house-tech-companies-launch-new-safeguards/story?id=101555314", "text": "President Joe Biden met with tech leaders Friday at the White House to highlight what he said are new, voluntary steps the companies are taking to step up safety and transparency around emerging AI technology.\n\nSeven major AI companies -- Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI -- announced Friday they will commit to allowing outside security testing of their products, share data about managing the risks of AI with governments, civil society, and academia, and create a way to acknowledge content that's created by their AI products with a digital watermark.\n\nAhead of his meeting with leaders from the companies, the president delivered short remarks, noting what he said was the promise and peril that AI poses for society.\n\n\"It is astounding, artificial intelligence, or \u2013 it promises, an enormous, enormous promise of both risk to our society and our economy and our national security, but it also incredible opportunities, incredible opportunities,\" Biden said.\n\nReminding that he and Vice President Kamala Harris met with the leaders two months ago, Biden said \"most of them are here again to underscore the responsibility and making sure that products that they are producing are safe and -- and making them public what they are and what they aren't.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks about artificial intelligence in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, July 2, 2023.

Sign up for it here.\n\nLast week, seven technology companies appeared at the White House and agreed to voluntary guardrails around the use of AI. In promising to take these steps, the companies are nodding to the potential risks of their creations without pausing their aggressive competition.\n\nFirst, here are four new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nA Convenient Gesture\n\nI was sitting in a dorm lobby slash seminar room the first time I heard someone compare Silicon Valley in the 2010s to Florence during the Renaissance. I was a college student in the Bay Area at the time, in 2013, and professors and peers were often talking about how we were in a unique period of flourishing that would reshape humanity. It proved true in some ways\u2014that era of tech, when companies such as Twitter and Facebook were freshly public and start-ups abounded, did change things (though the time\u2019s strain of techno-optimism somewhat curdled in the years that followed).\n\nI thought about that sentiment again this morning while reading Ross Andersen\u2019s new article for the September issue of The Atlantic, which profiles OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman. \u201cYou are about to enter the greatest golden age,\u201d Ross heard Altman tell a group of students. At another point, Altman says that the AI revolution will be \u201cdifferent from previous technological changes,\u201d and that it will be \u201clike a new kind of society.\u201d That Altman believes AI will reshape the world is clear. How exactly that transformation will play out is less clear. In recent months, as AI tools have achieved widespread usage and interest, OpenAI and its competitors have been doing an interesting dance: They are boosting their technology while also warning, many times in apocalyptic terms, of its potential harms.\n\nOn Friday, leaders from seven major AI companies\u2014OpenAI, Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, and Microsoft\u2014met with Joe Biden and agreed to a set of voluntary safeguards. The companies pledged, sometimes in vague terms, to take actions such as releasing information about security testing, sharing research with academics and governments, reporting \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d in their systems, and working on mechanisms that tell people when content is AI generated. Many of these are steps that the companies were already taking. And because the commitments made at the White House are voluntary, they aren\u2019t enforceable regulations. Still, they allow the companies, and Biden, to signal to the public that they are working on AI safety. In agreeing to these voluntary precautions, these companies are nodding to the possible risks of their creations while also sacrificing little in their aggressive competition.\n\n\u201cFor AI firms, this is a dream scenario, where they can ease regulatory pressure by pretending this fixes the problem, while ultimately continuing business as usual,\u201d Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, told me in an email. He added that other companies whose products pose safety risks, such as car manufacturers and nuclear-power plants, don\u2019t get to self-regulate.\n\nAltman has emerged as a main character of the AI industry, staking his claim as both a champion of the technology and a reasonable adult in the room. As Ross reports, the OpenAI CEO went on an international listening tour this spring, meeting with heads of state and lawmakers. In May, he appeared before Congress saying that he wanted AI to be regulated\u2014which can be viewed both as a civically responsible move and as a way to shift some responsibility onto Congress, which is likely to act slowly. So far, no comprehensive, binding regulations have emerged from these conversations and congressional hearings. And the companies keep growing.\n\nLeaders in the AI industry are forthcoming about the risks of their tools. A couple of months ago, AI luminaries, including Altman and Bill Gates, signed a one-sentence statement reading: \u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\u201d (Altman and other AI builders have invited comparisons to Robert Oppenheimer.) But the doomsday warnings also have the effect of making the technology sound pretty groundbreaking. Last month, my colleague Matteo Wong wrote about how this message is not just alarming but also self-serving: \u201cThe CEOs, like demigods, are wielding a technology as transformative as fire, electricity, nuclear fission, or a pandemic-inducing virus. You\u2019d be a fool not to invest.\u201d\n\nAnother upside: As my colleague Damon Beres said in an edition of this newsletter in May, discussing these technologies in vague, existential terms \u201cactually allows Altman, and others discussing the future of artificial intelligence, to dodge some of the everyday impacts that we\u2019re already seeing from the technology.\u201d AI is indeed having very real effects now: Chat tools are eroding jobs and reshaping college classrooms.\n\nBy asking for regulations, Damon added, the heads of these companies can cleverly put the ball in the lawmakers\u2019 court. (If Congress takes forever to pass laws, well, at least the industry tried!) Critics have pointed out that one of Altman\u2019s regulation ideas\u2014a new agency that would oversee the AI industry\u2014may take decades to build. In those decades, AI could become ubiquitous. Others have noted that, in suggesting that Congress pass a law requiring AI firms to have licenses to operate above a certain capacity, big companies like OpenAI can entrench themselves while potentially making it harder for smaller players to compete.\n\nThe tech industry may have learned a lesson from its PR disasters in the late 2010s. Instead of testifying after a fiasco happens, as Mark Zuckerberg did following the Cambridge Analytica debacle, leaders have lately been approaching Washington and requesting regulations instead. Sam Bankman-Fried, for example, managed to shore up his image by charming Washington and appearing dedicated to serious regulations\u2014that is, before FTX collapsed. And after years of lobbying against regulations, Facebook has in recent years begun requesting them.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to be cynical about self-imposed guardrails and to see them as toothless. But Friday\u2019s pledge acknowledged that there is work to be done, and the fact that bitter industry rivals aligned on that fact shows that, at the very least, it\u2019s no longer good PR to skirt government guardrails completely. The old way of doing things is no longer so palatable. For now, though, companies may keep trying to have it both ways. As one expert told Matteo, \u201cYou have to wonder: If you think this is so dangerous, why are you still building it?\u201d\n\nRelated:\n\nToday\u2019s News\n\nIsraeli lawmakers ratified the first piece of a legislative package designed to weaken the country\u2019s Supreme Court following months of protests and repeated warnings from the Biden administration.

There I was, maybe 7 or 8 years old, shaking a Folgers coffee can full of coins at the United Farm Workers\u2019 table where my mother was garrisoned two to three afternoons a week. I did most of my work alongside her, but several times an hour I would do what child soldiers have always done: served in a capacity that only a very small person could. I\u2019d go out in the parking lot and slip between cars to make sure no one was getting away without donating some coins or signing a petition. I\u2019d pop up next to a driver\u2019s-side window and give the can an aggressive rattle. I wasn\u2019t Jimmy Hoffa, but I wasn\u2019t playing any games either. My parents were old-school leftists, born in the 1920s and children during the Great Depression.

We convened a snap Twitter Space to talk it through and >1,000 AI Engineers tuned in. Playback here!\n\nWe are observing a once in a generation \u201cshift right\u201d of applied AI, fueled by the emergent capabilities and open source/API availability of Foundation Models.\n\nA wide range of AI tasks that used to take 5 years and a research team to accomplish in 2013, now just require API docs and a spare afternoon in 2023.\n\nas discussed in our spaces chat , the API line is permeable - AI Engineers can go left to tweak/host models and Research Engineers go right to build atop APIs too! But their relative strengths and \u201chome base\u201d is clear.\n\n\u201cIn numbers, there's probably going to be significantly more AI Engineers than there are ML engineers / LLM engineers. One can be quite successful in this role without ever training anything.\u201d - Andrej Karpathy\n\nHowever, the devil is in the details - there are no end of challenges in successfully evaluating, applying and productizing AI:\n\nModels: From evaluating the largest GPT-4 and Claude models, down to the smallest open source Huggingface, LLaMA, and other models\n\nTools : From the most popular chaining, retrieval and vector search tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Pinecone to the emerging field of autonomous agents like Auto-GPT and BabyAGI (must-read recap from Lilian Weng here)\n\nNews: On top of this, the sheer volume of papers and models and techniques published each day is exponentially increasing with interest and funding, so much so that keeping on top of it all is almost a full time job.\n\nI take this seriously and literally. I think it is a full time job. I think software engineering will spawn a new subdiscipline, specializing in applications of AI and wielding the emerging stack effectively, just as \u201csite reliability engineer\u201d, \u201cdevops engineer\u201d, \u201cdata engineer\u201d and \u201canalytics engineer\u201d emerged.\n\nThe emerging (and least cringe)\n\nversion of this role seems to be:\n\n.\n\nEvery startup I know of has some kind of #discuss-ai Slack channel. Those channels will turn from informal groups into formal teams, as Amplitude, Replit and Notion have done. The thousands of Software Engineers working on productionizing AI APIs and OSS models, whether on company time or on nights and weekends, in corporate Slacks or indie Discords, will professionalize and converge on a title - the AI Engineer. This will likely be the highest-demand engineering job of the decade.\n\nAI Engineers can be found everywhere from the largest companies like Microsoft and Google, to leading edge startups like Figma (via Diagram acquisition), Vercel (eg Hassan El Mghari\u2019s viral RoomGPT) and Notion (eg Ivan Zhao and Simon Last with Notion AI) to independent hackers like Simon Willison, Pieter Levels (of Photo/InteriorAI) and Riley Goodside (now at Scale AI). They are making $300k/yr doing prompt engineering at Anthropic and $900k building software at OpenAI. They are spending free weekends hacking on ideas at AGI House and sharing tips on /r/LocalLLaMA\n\n. What is common among them all is they are taking AI advancements and shaping them into real products used by millions, virtually overnight.\n\nNot a single PhD in sight. When it comes to shipping AI products, you want engineers, not researchers.\n\nThe AI vs ML Engineer Flippening\n\nI am calling attention to this trend rather than starting it. There are 10x as many ML Engineer jobs as AI Engineer jobs on Indeed, but the higher growth rate of \u201cAI\u201d leads me to predict that this ratio will invert in 5 years.\n\nMonthly job trends per HN Who\u2019s Hiring\n\nAll job titles are flawed, but some are useful. We are both wary and weary of the endless semantic debates on the difference between AI and ML, and are well aware that regular \u201csoftware engineer\u201d roles are perfectly capable of building AI software. However a recent Ask HN question on How to Break into AI Engineering illustrates the fundamental perception that still persists in the market:\n\nJun 2023 screenshot: top voted answers for \u201cHow to break into AI Engineering\u201d\n\nMost people still consider AI Engineering as a form of either Machine Learning or Data Engineering, so they recommend the same prerequisites. But I guarantee you that none of the highly effective AI Engineers I named above have done the equivalent work of the Andrew Ng Coursera courses, nor do they know PyTorch, nor do they know the difference between a Data Lake or Data Warehouse\n\n.\n\nIn the near future, nobody will recommend starting in AI Engineering by reading Attention is All You Need, just like you do not start driving by reading the schematics for the Ford Model T. Sure, understanding fundamentals and history is always helpful, and does help you find ideas and efficiency/capability gains that are not yet in common consciousness. But sometimes you can just use products and learn their qualities through experience.\n\nI don\u2019t expect this \u201cflippening\u201d of the curriculum to happen overnight. It is human nature to want to stuff a resume, fill out a market map, and stand out by citing deeper topics with more authority. In other words, Prompt Engineering and AI Engineering will feel inferior to people with good Data Science/ML backgrounds for a long while. However, I think sheer demand-and-supply economics will prevail.\n\nWhy AI Engineers are Emerging Now\n\nWhenever a subgroup arises that has a completely different background, speaks a different language, produces a completely different set of products, and uses a completely different set of tools, they eventually split out into their own group.\n\n1+2=3: The Role of Code in the evolution from Software 2.0 to Software 3.0\n\n6 years ago, Andrej Karpathy wrote a very influential essay describing Software 2.0 - contrasting the \u201cclassical stack\u201d of hand-coded programming languages that precisely model logic against the new stack of \u201cmachine learned\u201d neural networks that approximate logic, enabling software to solve a lot more problems than could humanly be modeled. He followed it up this year by noting that the hottest new programming language is English, finally filling out the gray area in his diagram that was left unlabeled in the original essay.\n\nLast year, Prompt Engineering was the memetic take on how jobs would change as people began to put GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion to work. People derided AI startups as \u201cOpenAI Wrappers\u201d, and fretted as LLM apps proved susceptible to prompt injection and reverse prompt engineering. No moat to be found?\n\nBut one of the biggest themes of 2023 has very much been about re-establishing the role of human-written code to orchestrate and supplant LLM power, from the >$200m behemoth Langchain, to Nvidia-backed Voyager showing the unmistakable importance of code generation and reuse (I recently took part in a Chains vs Agents webinar with Harrison where I expanded on the thesis of Code Core vs LLM Core applications).\n\nPrompt Engineering was both overhyped and here to stay, but the re-emergence of Software 1.0 paradigms in Software 3.0 applications is both an area of mass opportunity/confusion, and created white space for a mess of startups:\n\nare you even a VC if you don\u2019t market map?\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be just human-written code, of course. My recent adventures with smol-developer, the larger scoped gpt-engineer, and other code generation agents like Codium AI, Codegen.ai and Morph/Rift will increasingly be a part of the AI Engineer toolkit. As human Engineers learn to harness AI, AIs will increasingly do Engineering as well, until a distant future when we look up one day and can no longer tell the difference.\n\nIt\u2019s Time To Converge - AI Engineer Summit\n\nBuilders need a place to talk turpentine. This is why, after months of organizing small meetups, we are now announcing the first independently run, builder oriented AI conference: The AI Engineer Summit!\n\ncheck out our nifty domain - ai.engineer !\n\nIf everything in this post is resonating with you, we aim to convene all the top AI Engineers, founders, and investors together to learn about the state of the art, attend/teach workshops and find everything from the great new tool they\u2019ll use at work, to their next new hire/cofounder/round.\n\nThe definitive conference to discuss everything that we\u2019ve covered in the past year on this newsletter and our podcast, and more:\n\nAI UX\n\nAI Devtools\n\nAI Infra\n\nAI Agents\n\nNew LLM Tools, including Langchain, Vector DBs, and more\n\nOpen Source Models (training, finetuning, inferencing, evaling)\n\nI have a fair amount of experience running community, but have never run a 500 person conference, so I have teamed up with Ben Dunphy of Reactathon to put on the best AI Engineer conference in San Francisco (and online - his last conference had 20,000+ tuning in remotely).\n\nJoin us at ai.engineer!\n\nWe are accepting both speaker CFPs and sponsors (get in touch!).\n\nWe are the Builders\n\nKeen observers will have noticed that we\u2019ve gradually the Latent Space podcast and newsletter to cater to the AI Engineer persona. What excites me most about serving this audience is the combination of techno-optimism and practicality. Marc Andreesen recently wrote about how the vast majority of public AI discourse has been \u201chysterical fear and paranoia\u201d, calling out that there is a whole profession of \u201cAI safety expert\u201d, \u201cAI ethicist\u201d, \u201cAI risk researcher\u201d paid to be doomers, but no corresponding role for builders and foomers. On the other end of the spectrum, there are many unserious accelerationists and intolerable foomer threadbois who spend all day on Twitter talking about a distant Utopian future, but it\u2019s unclear what they are doing to bring it about.\n\nAI Engineers will tame and ride Shoggoth.\n\nLet\u2019s make this a thing.\n\nFurther discussions are live on Hacker News and Twitter.\n\nAuthor\u2019s note: I am especially grateful to my cohost Alessio Fanelli of Decibel and Sarah Guo and Pranav Reddy of Conviction for reviewing drafts of this post and providing critical feedback and invaluable support.

This initiative underscores safety, security, and trust principles in developing AI technologies.\n\nThe companies that have pledged their commitment include Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI. Interestingly, despite Apple's work in AI and machine learning, the company is missing from the talks.\n\nThe absence of Apple from this initiative raises questions about the company's stance on AI safety and its commitment to managing the risks associated with AI technologies.\n\nAI commitments and initiatives\n\nOne of the primary commitments made by these companies is to ensure that AI products undergo rigorous internal and external security testing before they are released to the public. The testing aims to guard against significant AI risks like biosecurity, cybersecurity, and broader societal effects.\n\nFurthermore, these companies have taken the responsibility to share vital information on managing AI risks. Sharing that information won't be limited to the industry but will extend to governments, civil society, and academia.\n\nThe goal is to establish best practices for safety, provide information on attempts to bypass safeguards and foster technical collaboration.\n\nIn terms of security, these companies are investing heavily in cybersecurity measures. A significant focus is protecting proprietary and unreleased AI model weights, which are crucial components of an AI system.\n\nThe companies have agreed that these model weights should only be released when intended and after considering potential security risks. Additionally, they facilitate third-party discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities in their AI systems, ensuring that any persisting issues are promptly identified and rectified.\n\nPresident Biden meets with AI companies on safety standards and commitments.

The companies are prioritizing research into the societal risks that AI systems can pose, which includes efforts to avoid harmful bias and discrimination and to protect user privacy.\n\nThey are also committed to leveraging AI to address some of society's most pressing challenges, ranging from cancer prevention to climate change mitigation.", "tiktoken_token_count": 547, "llama_token_count": 698}, {"source_name": "AppleInsider", "author": "news@appleinsider.com (William Gallagher)", "title": "Apple Vision Pro draws investors back to struggling VR/AR market", "description": "Investors dissatisfied with AR firms, or just wary of investing before Apple entered the field, are now beginning to back headset companies following the launch of Apple Vision Pro.Apple Vision Pro photographed at Apple ParkBack in 2021, investors seemed to b\u2026", "url": "https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/07/26/apple-vision-pro-draws-investors-back-to-struggling-vrar-market", "text": "If you buy through our links, we may get a commission.

The company has pitched the tool to a handful of major news organizations, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, as a \"personal assistant\" or \"helpmate\" for journalists that can automate some tasks, the Times reported. Genesis is able to \"take in information -- details of current events, for example -- and generate news content,\" the Times said, citing \"people familiar with the matter.\"\n\nIn an emailed statement to CNET, Google acknowledged it's exploring how AI could aid news publishers but didn't give specifics on the tools it's testing. \"In partnership with news publishers, especially smaller publishers, we're in the earliest stages of exploring ideas to potentially provide AI-enabled tools to help journalists with their work,\" said a Google spokesperson. \"These tools are not intended to, and cannot, replace the essential role journalists have in reporting, creating and fact-checking their articles.\"\n\nStill, people who've seen Google's pitch called it \"unsettling,\" the Times said, because it \"seemed to take for granted the effort that went into producing accurate and artful news stories.\" Another concern: Google, which decides which news stories users see at the top of their search results, could give preference to stories that use Genesis.\n\nTo be sure, many publishers, including the Post, the Journal, The Associated Press, NPR, Insider and CNET, are experimenting with genAI tools to see how they might assist reporters by creating everything from headlines to story summaries to routine recaps of sports events and election results. AI tools could help media organizations, which have been cutting staff amid a challenging advertising market, keep pace with the 24/7 news cycle.\n\nBut Google's efforts come as governments have criticized the search engine juggernaut for not giving \"news outlets a larger slice of its advertising revenue,\" and as news sites call out Google (and other AI companies) for \"sucking up\" their editorial content to train their AI systems without permission and \"without compensating the publishers,\" the Times noted.\n\nOn top of this, Google's chatbot, Bard, which provides more-complex answers to users' search queries, is already raising publisher's concerns because it may mean Google doesn't need to send users to more authoritative sources for answers, sources like news publishers.\n\nHow will this story end? Not sure even an AI could predict that at this point.\n\n7 Tech Companies Sign White House Safety Pledge\n\nThe other big news of the week came Friday when seven AI tech companies -- Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, Anthropic and Inflection -- agreed with the Joe Biden administration's ask that they allow \"independent security experts to test their systems before they are released to the public and committed to sharing data about the safety of their systems with the government and academics,\" The Washington Post reported. \"The firms also pledged to develop systems to alert the public when an image, video or text is created by artificial intelligence, a method known as 'watermarking.'\"\n\n\"US companies lead the world in innovation, and they have a responsibility to do that and continue to do that, but they have an equal responsibility to ensure that their products are safe, secure and trustworthy,\" Jeff Zients, the White House chief of staff, said in an interview with NPR.\n\nThe tech assurances around AI safety come as governments and AI, tech and other experts say generative AI systems may pose serious risks to humanity and that companies creating these systems should be regulated. Congress has generally not offered \"comprehensive legislation\" to regulate Silicon Valley, the Post noted, adding that Sen. Chuck Schumer has created a bipartisan committee to look at creating new rules around AI.\n\nAlready under scrutiny by the FTC over its ChatGPT chatbot, OpenAI tweeted that the White House pledge shows that AI companies have agreed to \"a set of voluntary commitments to reinforce the safety, security and trustworthiness of AI technology and our services. An important step in advancing meaningful and effective AI governance around the world.\"\n\nExpect more details about how the companies will live up to their AI safety pledges to emerge in coming weeks. Here's the White House fact sheet on the announcement.\n\nGoogle, Bard and beyond\n\n\n\nIn other Google news, the company, which made Bard publicly available in May in English, Japanese and Korean at its Google I/O developer fest, said its chatbot now supports over 40 languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Farsi, French, German, Greek, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Thai, Ukrainian and Vietnamese. The complete list of languages can be found here.\n\nIn addition, Google also made good on an I/O promise to \"allow users to drop images into Bard to help you analyze, create a caption or find more information on the internet,\" CNET reported. But that feature is available only in English -- at least for right now.\n\nThe details about these and other Bard updates can be found on Google's blog.\n\nMeta and Microsoft partner on Llama 2 AI engine\n\nMeta, which launched its Llama large language model in February, is stepping up efforts to get more people to use its AI tech. The company this week said the next generation of Llama, Llama 2, is now available free for commercial and research use, as part of a deal with Microsoft, CNET reported. Meta shared the news on its blog.\n\nLarge language models, or LLMs, are what power generative AI chatbots, including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard. Microsoft launched an AI-powered Bing search earlier this year, which uses ChatGPT. Under the partnership with Meta, Microsoft said it now also offers access to Llama 2 through Azure AI and on Windows.\n\nAP licenses its archive to ChatGPT\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press says it's licensed its text archive of news stories going back to 1985 to OpenAI/ChatGPT in a deal with undisclosed financial terms. The news comes as copyright holders and authors, including comedian Sarah Silverman, are suing ChatGPT for harvesting their copyrighted content without permission, to train its chatbot, and as the US Federal Trade Commission investigates how ChatGPT essentially works.\n\n\"In order to guard against how the courts may decide, maybe [AI companies] want to go out and sign licensing deals so you're guaranteed legal access to the material you'll need,\" Nick Diakopoulos, a professor of communications studies and computer science at Northwestern University, told the AP.\n\nWhile the AP has billed itself as one of the first media organizations to use AI to create news summaries and other content, it says it doesn't use any genAI in its news stories today. But that will most certainly change. In any case, OpenAI, with this deal, is paying for publishers' content in some way, and that alone is interesting.\n\nTracking subway fare hoppers, drug dealers\n\n\n\nHere are two interesting stories on how AI technology is being used to track people doing things they shouldn't be doing -- and is spurring privacy questions along the way.\n\nFirst up, the New York City subway system has been quietly using AI-surveillance software at some subway stations to capture the faces of people who skip paying fares. It's part of a program to reduce losses from \"fare evasion,\" according to public documents and government contracts obtained by NBC News.\n\n\"The system was in use in seven subway stations in May, according to a report on fare evasion published online by the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which oversees New York City's public transportation,\" NBC News said. \"The MTA expects that by the end of the year, the system will expand by 'approximately two dozen more stations, with more to follow,'\" the report says. The report also found that the MTA lost $690 million to fare evasion in 2022.\"\n\nThough the MTA says its focus is on fare evasion, privacy advocates are concerned about what the subway system will do with the face scans. NBC News said an MTA spokesperson told the news outlet that the AI system \"doesn't flag fare evaders to New York police, but she declined to comment on whether that policy could change.\"\n\nAnd now for the second story. Forbes reported that New York used AI tech, including Automatic License Plate Recognition technology, to assess the driving behavior of a drug trafficker after analyzing the route the driver had taken over multiple years and analyzing traffic patterns deemed suspicious.\n\nWhile the Rekor software allowed people to identify and arrest the drug trafficker, it was also used \"to examine the driving patterns of anyone passing one of Westchester County's 480 cameras over a two-year period,\" Forbes added, citing an ACLU senior staff attorney who described the mass surveillance of drivers as \"quite horrifying.\"\n\nAI, anime and Harry Potter\n\n\n\nAI is now converting live-action movies into anime style using Stable Diffusion, a popular text-to-image converter, CNET video producer Jason Pepper told me. \"The power of this app continues to impress me. This example takes a scene from a Harry Potter movie and converts it into anime.\" The 45-second clip created by Twitter user @heyBarsee, in which Hermione shows off her wizarding skills with the Wingardium Leviosa levitating charm, is worth a watch.\n\nAI word of the week\n\n\n\nOver the past few months, I've read through AI glossaries to get caught up on the vocabulary around the new world of generative AI. This week's AI word of the week, paperclips, comes courtesy of CNBC's \"How to talk about AI like an insider.\"\n\n\"Paperclips: An important symbol for AI Safety proponents because they symbolize the chance an AGI [artificial general intelligence program] could destroy humanity. It refers to a thought experiment published by philosopher Nick Bostrom about a 'superintelligence' given the mission to make as many paperclips as possible. It decides to turn all humans, Earth, and increasing parts of the cosmos into paperclips. OpenAI's logo is a reference to this tale.\n\n\"Example: 'It also seems perfectly possible to have a superintelligence whose sole goal is something completely arbitrary, such as to manufacture as many paperclips as possible, and who would resist with all its might any attempt to alter this goal,\" Bostrom wrote in his thought experiment.\"\n\nEditors' note: CNET is using an AI engine to help create some stories.

Fake imagery causes confusion, panic, hate, and bullying, and it\u2019s now easier to create than ever. But there\u2019s a step forward to resolving, or at least minimizing, the issue. Seven major tech companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, have promised to create watermarks for AI-generated content. This way, it could become safer to share AI content without misleading people about its authenticity.\n\n[Related reading: Bye-bye fake news: this free tool spots AI-generated images in a second]\n\nOther than OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, the companies joining the effort are Meta, Amazon, Anthropic, and Inflection. They have promised to label the AI-generated content, but for now, it\u2019s not exactly clear how they will do this watermarking will. However, we can assume that it will be integrated with the content. This way, people can trace where it came from and what AI tools were used to make it. If you\u2019ve played with Adobe Firefly, you\u2019ve noticed that its images already have a watermark like that.\n\nThe White House believes that \u201cthe watermark will enable creativity with AI to flourish but reduces the dangers of fraud and deception.\u201d It would be a win-win situation, and tech companies have responded to the concerns and suggestions.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s plan\n\nOpenAI responded to the White House\u2019s concerns, committing to manage various risks and concerns. They include safety, security, and trust, among other things. OpenAI writes that it will \u201cdevelop and deploy mechanisms that enable users to understand if audio or visual content is AI-generated, including robust provenance, watermarking, or both, for AI-generated audio or visual content.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s plan\n\nGoogle has also addressed the potential issues with AI-generated content and the solutions it plans to incorporate. The company plans to include metadata and other techniques, along with watermarking, to encourage reliable information. Google added, however, that no single company can manage AI correctly alone.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to content, we\u2019re taking steps to promote trustworthy information. We\u2019ll soon be integrating watermarking, metadata, and other innovative techniques into our latest generative models, and bringing an About this image tool to Google Search to give you context about where an image first appeared online. Addressing AI-generated content will require industry-wide solutions, and we look forward to working with others, including the Partnership for AI\u2019s synthetic media working group.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s plan\n\nMicrosoft has also committed to developing a \u201csafe, secure, and trustworthy AI.\u201d They don\u2019t explicitly mention watermarking, though, neither in the blog post nor in the more detailed AI managing plan. the company greeted the government\u2019s efforts in balancing the potential and risks of AI and encouraged the tech industry to make AI safer and more beneficial.\n\nSafe use of AI should be a joint effort\n\nIn addition to watermarks, tech companies have also voluntarily agreed to test AI systems before their release, invest more in cybersecurity, and share information to decrease AI risks. Microsoft has also promised to support the creation of a national registry to keep track of high-risk AI systems.\n\nBut as Google said, \u201cNone of us can get AI right on our own.\u201d And it\u2019s not just major tech companies, but I\u2019d also extend this to individuals who use and consume AI-generated content. I believe that we can all have a role in this new and fast-changing industry and the way we use it. As producers, we need to be clear about whether or not content is AI-generated and if it contains accurate information. And as consumers, we need to develop critical thinking and reasonable doubt instead of believing everything we see \u2013 now more than ever. We can also check whether images are AI or not, which I think is awesome. But having tech companies and major news outlets be transparent about it is certainly a must. As individual creators and consumers, we can\u2019t manage AI on our own, either.\n\n[via ArsTechnica]", "tiktoken_token_count": 805, "llama_token_count": 970}, {"source_name": "The A.V.

The entertainment landscape now couldn\u2019t look more different, and the stakes now may be higher than ever\u2014which is bringing today\u2019s Hollywood leaders to the forefront, like one Mr. George Clooney.\n\nDuring what was described as \u201cearly hours LA time,\u201d Clooney issued a statement to Deadline that \u201cactors and writers in large numbers have lost their ability to make a living.\u201d Echoing a letter with hundreds of high-profile signatories issued shortly before the strike, Clooney said, \u201cThis is an inflection point in our industry. For our industry to survive that has to change. For actors, that journey starts now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany other actors have weighed in on the possibility of a strike, including Clooney\u2019s Ocean\u2019s Eleven co-star Matt Damon. Damon, who shortly after speaking with Deadline left the premiere of his new film Oppenheimer as part of the strike, acknowledged the implications of shutting down the industry and the impact it will have on workers everywhere. However, he said, \u201cIf our leadership is saying that the deal isn\u2019t fair, then we gotta hold strong until we get a deal that\u2019s fair for working actors. It\u2019s the difference between having healthcare and not for a lot of actors, and we gotta do what\u2019s right by them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSAG-AFTRA leadership certainly did call out the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) for presenting an unfair deal. In a press conference to announce the strike, current SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher gave a fiery speech condemning the studios and streamers. \u201cWe stand in solidarity, in unprecedented unity. Our union and our sister unions and the unions around the world are standing by us, as well as other labor unions, because at some point the jig is up,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot keep being dwindled and marginalized and disrespected and dishonored. The entire business model has been changed by streaming, digital, AI. This is a moment of history that is a moment of truth. If we don\u2019t stand tall right now, we are all going to be in trouble.\u201d\n\nAs Damon and Clooney both noted, it\u2019s not the stars in their tax bracket who most need to be protected by union action. It\u2019s the everyday working actors who make up the majority of SAG-AFTRA who are at greater risk of the existential threats of a changing industry. \u201cI\u2019ve had people even in the industry, like makeup artists, or people who don\u2019t really understand how actors are paid, ask me, \u2018Why do actors have to strike?

It is vital that AI companies \u2013 especially those working on the most powerful models \u2013 align on common ground and advance thoughtful and adaptable safety practices to ensure powerful AI tools have the broadest benefit possible. This is urgent work and this forum is well\u2013 positioned to act quickly to advance the state of AI safety.\u201d Anna Makanju, Vice President of Global Affairs, OpenAI \u201cAnthropic believes that AI has the potential to fundamentally change how the world works. We are excited to collaborate with industry, civil society, government, and academia to promote safe and responsible development of the technology. The Frontier Model Forum will play a vital role in coordinating best practices and sharing research on frontier AI safety.\u201d Dario Amodei, CEO, Anthropic\n\nRed Teaming For Safety\n\nAnthropic, in particular, highlighted the importance of cybersecurity in developing frontier AI models.\n\nThe makers of Claude 2 have recently unveiled its strategy for \u201cred teaming,\u201d an adversarial testing technique aimed at bolstering AI systems\u2019 safety and security.\n\nThis intensive, expertise-driven method evaluates risk baselines and establishes consistent practices across numerous subject domains.\n\nAs part of their initiative, Anthropic conducted a classified study into biological risks, concluding that unmitigated models could pose imminent threats to national security.\n\nYet, the company also identified substantial mitigating measures that could minimize these potential hazards.\n\nThe frontier threats red teaming process involves working with domain experts to define threat models, developing automated evaluations based on expert insights, and ensuring the repeatability and scalability of these evaluations.\n\nIn their biosecurity-focused study involving more than 150 hours of red teaming, Anthropic discovered that advanced AI models can generate intricate, accurate, and actionable knowledge at an expert level.\n\nAs models increase in size and gain access to tools, their proficiency, particularly in biology, heightens, potentially actualizing these risks within two to three years.\n\nAnthropic\u2019s research led to the discovery of mitigations that reduce harmful outputs during the training process and make it challenging for malevolent actors to obtain detailed, linked, expert-level information for destructive purposes.\n\nCurrently, these mitigations are integrated into Anthropic\u2019s public-facing frontier model, with further experiments in the pipeline.\n\nAI Companies Commit To Managing AI Risks\n\nLast week, the White House brokered voluntary commitments from seven principal AI companies\u2014Amazon, OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Inflection, Meta, and Anthropic.\n\nThe seven AI companies, signifying the future of technology, were entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring the safety of their products.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration stressed the need to uphold the highest standards to ensure that innovative strides are not taken at the expense of American citizens\u2019 rights and safety.\n\nThe three guiding principles that the participating companies are committed to are safety, security, and trust.\n\nBefore shipping a product, the companies pledged to complete internal and external security testing of AI systems, managed partly by independent experts. The aim would be to counter risks such as biosecurity, cybersecurity, and broader societal effects.\n\nSecurity was at the forefront of these commitments, promising to bolster cybersecurity and establish insider threat safeguards to protect proprietary and unreleased model weights, the core component of an AI system.\n\nTo instill public trust, companies also committed to the creation of robust mechanisms to inform users when content is AI-generated.\n\nThey also pledged to issue public reports on AI systems\u2019 capabilities, limitations, and usage scope. These reports could shed light on security and societal risks, including the effects on fairness and bias.\n\nFurther, these companies are committed to advancing AI systems to address some of the world\u2019s most significant challenges, including cancer prevention and climate change mitigation.\n\nAs part of the agenda, the administration plans to work with international allies and partners to establish a robust framework governing the development and use of AI.\n\nPublic Voting On AI Safety\n\nIn June, OpenAI launched an initiative with the Citizens Foundation and The Governance Lab to ascertain public sentiment on AI safety.\n\nA website was created to foster discussion about the potential risks associated with LLMs.\n\nPublic members could vote on AI safety priorities via a tool known as AllOurIdeas. It was designed to help understand the public\u2019s prioritization of various considerations associated with AI risks.\n\nThe tool employs a method called \u201cPairwise Voting,\u201d which prompts users to juxtapose two potential AI risk priorities and select the one they deem more crucial.\n\nThe objective is to glean as much information as possible about public concerns, thus directing resources more effectively toward addressing the issues that people find most pressing.\n\nThe votes helped to gauge public opinion about the responsible development of AI technology.\n\nIn the coming weeks, a virtual roundtable discussion will be organized to evaluate the results of this public consultation.\n\nA GPT-4 analysis of the votes determined that the top three ideas for AI were as follows.\n\nModels need to be as intelligent as possible and recognize the biases in their training data. Everyone, regardless of their race, religion, political leaning, gender, or income, should have access to impartial AI technology. The cycle of AI aiding in the progress of knowledge, which serves as the foundation for AI, should not impede progress.\n\nConversely, there were three unpopular ideas:\n\nA balanced approach would involve government bodies providing guidance, which AI companies can use to create their advice. Advanced weaponry kill/live decisions are not made using AI. Using this for political or religious purposes is not recommended as it may create a new campaigning approach.\n\nThe Future Of AI Safety\n\nAs AI plays an increasingly prominent role in search and digital marketing, these developments hold substantial significance for those in marketing and tech.\n\nThese commitments and initiatives made by leading AI companies could shape AI regulations and policleading lead to a future of responsible AI development.\n\nFeatured image: Derek W/Shutterstock", "tiktoken_token_count": 1712, "llama_token_count": 2154}, {"source_name": "Android Authority", "author": "Ryan McNeal", "title": "Google, Microsoft, and more commit to AI safety at White House, Apple absent", "description": "The group included Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI.", "url": "https://www.androidauthority.com/ai-development-white-house-apple-3347464/", "text": "Rita El Khoury / Android Authority\n\nTL;DR Industry leaders went to the White House to pledge their commitment to developing safe and transparent AI.\n\nThe companies agreed to watermark AI-generated content, test products internally and externally before release, and more.\n\nApple was noticeably absent from the meeting.\n\nSince OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a variety of other companies have rushed to push out their own AI-powered products. Over the months since then, we\u2019ve seen the good and bad of what AI can be capable of. To help rein in the bad, several industry leaders have made a commitment to safer AI development, but one leader was notably missing.\n\nToday, it was announced that seven leading AI companies convened at the White House to pledge their voluntary commitment to the safe, secure, and transparent development of AI technology. These companies included Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI.\n\nOne of the commitments that could have the biggest impact is the agreement to watermark AI-generated content. Watermarks would make it much easier to identify when AI created something. \u201cThis action enables creativity with AI to flourish but reduces the dangers of fraud and deception,\u201d says the White House. Such a step could help prevent confusion from deep fakes such as the Pope puffer jacket photo or the AI voice-generating software currently being used to scam people out of money.\n\nAnother commitment the group agreed to is sharing AI risk management information across the industry and with governments, civil society, and academia. Additionally, they committed to reporting their AI systems\u2019s capabilities, limitations, and areas of appropriate and inappropriate use. According to the White House, the report would cover \u201cboth security risks and societal risks, such as the effects on fairness and bias.\u201d There\u2019s a full list of the other commitments that you can view in the press release.\n\nNoticeably missing from the group was Apple.

What if bots started creating scripture?", "url": "https://thewalrus.ca/ai-religion/", "text": "The picture of Pope Francis in a voluminous white puffer jacket jolted the religious as well as secular worlds. Within moments of its being posted at the end of March, social media was overrun with opinions. Supporters roared their approval, and opponents lamented yet another example of the pontiff selling out to modernity. Thing is, the photo wasn\u2019t real. It was a deepfake, thereby becoming another reminder of the dangers of artificial intelligence: a fictitious portrayal of a world leader causing disunity among countless people.\n\nThese kinds of fabrications are part of what, that same month, led more than a thousand artificial intelligence experts to call for a temporary halt in the development of \u201cgiant AI experiments\u201d until the technology can be made trustworthy. If unleashed without proper safeguards, commentators and critics argue, AI systems can destabilize and confuse; and as they learn and adapt and maybe even approach sentience, they could present a threat, perhaps an alternative, to humanity.\n\nSounds like the stuff of science fiction, but then, in these scenarios, it\u2019s always the nerdy scientist or bumbling philosopher warning the world. \u201cThey should have listened!\u201d we say as some calamity wipes away life as we know it. When it comes to AI, some people are listening, though\u2014particularly those in organized religion, with its concern for human individuality, the uniqueness of the soul, and the embrace of a higher power.\n\nTheologians and social commentators worry that a new religion could develop around an extreme reverence for AI. The essence of religion is faith: a leap of commitment to something beyond direct knowledge and a love for that which we can never completely understand. We can read the arguments and be convinced by the logic, but ultimately, we have to embrace that cloud of unknowing.\n\nNot so with AI, where a religious aura could develop around a non-existent figure who appears on our screens and who seems all-knowing and all-understanding: all-knowing because it would have all of the information contained on the internet at its fingertips, all-understanding because your information will be there too\u2014and often far more than you ever thought you had made public. \u201cWhat is going to be created will effectively be a god,\u201d former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski told Wired in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s not a god in the sense that it makes lightning or causes hurricanes. But if there is something a billion times smarter than the smartest human, what else are you going to call it?\u201d\n\nIs the deification of AI really so impossible? For the susceptible, instant communication with an entity representing a god, even God himself, could be transformative. And let\u2019s be candid\u2014those seeking certainty in faith can be particularly credulous. The philosopher Blaise Pascal is said to have written that there is a god-shaped hole in each of us. Not sure if I agree, but the hunger to believe in something beyond the self is real. The New York Times has reported on the \u201cpseudo-sacred industry\u201d and the rise of so-called social divinity consultants who help introduce spiritual practices into tech companies. The massive decline in traditional religious adherence, combined with a craving for some kind of faith, has led many to embrace alien life, new-age offerings, and dangerous cults. For historian and scholar Yuval Noah Harari, AI could be even more alluring, especially if it starts generating scripture. Then the tool\u2019s oracular qualities can morph into a belief system that might spread and reshape society. \u201c[R]eligions throughout history claimed that their holy books were written by unknown human intelligence,\u201d Harari said at a recent science conference. \u201cThis was never true before. This could become true very, very quickly, with far-reaching consequences.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t have to wait for algorithms to conjure up a celestial figure. There\u2019s plenty AI could disrupt right now, such as revolutionizing the structure of a standard religious service. Whatever the denomination, the sermon is the major part of any such gathering, and I can tell you, as someone who writes and delivers them on a weekly basis, that it\u2019s a challenge to be original, fresh, and entertaining.\n\nAt the current level being provided by AI tools like ChatGPT and anticipating what can be expected even in the near future, AI could create figures capable of injecting emotion, inflection, and sincerity into a homily and have quick access to the contents of every religious commentary there is. It could also find jokes and witticisms and be able to make it all seem bitingly relevant through its knowledge of current events. It will also possess the thumping advantage of immediacy. Rabbi Joshua Franklin, who leads the Jewish Center of the Hamptons in East Hampton, posted on Vimeo a sermon written by ChatGPT he delivered last year. \u201cYou\u2019re clapping,\u201d Franklin told the congregation after he revealed the true author of the words he\u2019d just spoken. \u201cI\u2019m deathly afraid.\u201d\n\nWhat can\u2019t be provided, at least for the moment, is genuine personal contact and pastoral outreach. A great deal of the work of a priest is simple presence: being still and silent a few feet away from someone who is experiencing visceral grief or is in wounded need. But what we found during the pandemic-imposed Zoom years is that screen solidarity, while never quite the same thing as actually being there, was a good substitute. Now imagine an onscreen cleric on call, day or night, able to listen and respond and able to assimilate individual experiences and respond accordingly. The popularity of mental health chatbots suggests that this might not be too far fetched. And interestingly enough, GitaGPT, a recently launched chatbot, provides spiritual guidance by consulting the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nMy belief as an Anglican priest is that I\u2019ve been given authority by my bishop through what we refer to as the apostolic succession. That enables me to call on the Holy Spirit during the Eucharistic service when I pray over the bread and wine. A layperson can\u2019t do this, even a deacon can\u2019t do this, and certainly not a non-human system. But maybe the lack of association with any organized worship works in AI\u2019s favour. The technology would be a blank slate: an absence of malice, no history of harm. To be sure, there are justifiable concerns about the technology\u2019s proneness to racist and discriminatory speech, shaped by the data it trains on. But we can surely imagine the opposite: an artificial entity that promotes itself as an expression of goodness and that, unlike religion down the ages, has never led Crusades, organized Inquisitions, or persecuted those with whom it differs. At least not yet.\n\nBeyond all of this, however, is something more radical: the secular worship of AI itself. The idea, promoted by some techno-utopians, that such systems can solve any issue is maybe what we should really be fearing. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, responsible for creating ChatGPT, said at a recent US senate hearing that his company \u201cwas founded on the belief that artificial intelligence has the ability to improve nearly every aspect of our lives.\u201d Perhaps fantasy or foolishness gone wild, perhaps not. \u201cConvince me it\u2019s AI generated,\u201d said one person on Twitter after the pope\u2019s puffer coat revelation.

By contrast, the power of generative AI tools to democratize AI\u2014to spread it through every function of the enterprise, to support every employee, and to engage every customer \u2014heralds an inflection point where AI can grow from a technology employed for particular use cases to one that truly defines the modern enterprise.\n\nAs such, chief information officers and technical leaders will have to act decisively: embracing generative AI to seize its opportunities and avoid ceding competitive ground, while also making strategic decisions about data infrastructure, model ownership, workforce structure, and AI governance that will have long-term consequences for organizational success.\n\nThis report explores the latest thinking of chief information officers at some of the world\u2019s largest and best-known companies, as well as experts from the public, private, and academic sectors. It presents their thoughts about AI against the backdrop of our global survey of 600 senior data and technology executives.\n\nKey findings include the following:\n\n\u2022 A trove of unstructured and buried data is now legible, unlocking business value. Previous AI initiatives had to focus on use cases where structured data was ready and abundant; the complexity of collecting, annotating, and synthesizing heterogeneous datasets made wider AI initiatives unviable. By contrast, generative AI\u2019s new ability to surface and utilize once-hidden data will power extraordinary new advances across the organization.\n\n\n\n\u2022 The generative AI era requires a data infrastructure that is flexible, scalable, and efficient. To power these new initiatives, chief information officers and technical leads are embracing next-generation data infrastructures. More advanced approaches, such as data lakehouses, can democratize access to data and analytics, enhance security, and combine low-cost storage with high-performance querying.\n\n\u2022 Some organizations seek to leverage open-source technology to build their own LLMs, capitalizing on and protecting their own data and IP. CIOs are already cognizant of the limitations and risks of third-party services, including the release of sensitive intelligence and reliance on platforms they do not control or have visibility into. They also see opportunities around developing customized LLMs and realizing value from smaller models. The most successful organizations will strike the right strategic balance based on a careful calculation of risk, comparative advantage, and governance.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Automation anxiety should not be ignored, but dystopian forecasts are overblown. Generative AI tools can already complete complex and varied workloads, but CIOs and academics interviewed for this report do not expect large-scale automation threats. Instead, they believe the broader workforce will be liberated from time-consuming work to focus on higher value areas of insight, strategy, and business value.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Unified and consistent governance are the rails on which AI can speed forward. Generative AI brings commercial and societal risks, including protecting commercially sensitive IP, copyright infringement, unreliable or unexplainable results, and toxic content. To innovate quickly without breaking things or getting ahead of regulatory changes, diligent CIOs must address the unique governance challenges of generative AI, investing in technology, processes, and institutional structures.\n\nDownload the full report.\n\nThis content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

The new assistants - often called \"agents\" or \"copilots\" - promise to perform more complex personal and work tasks when commanded to by a human, without needing close supervision.\n\n\"High level, we want this to become something like your personal AI friend,\" said developer Div Garg, whose company MultiOn is beta-testing an AI agent.\n\n\"It could evolve into Jarvis, where we want this to be connected to a lot of your services,\" he added, referring to Tony Stark's indispensable AI in the Iron Man films. \"If you want to do something, you go talk to your AI and it does your things.\"\n\nThe industry is still far from emulating science fiction's dazzling digital assistants; Garg's agent browses the web to order a burger on DoorDash, for example, while others can create investment strategies, email people selling refrigerators on Craigslist or summarize work meetings for those who join late.\n\n\"Lots of what's easy for people is still incredibly hard for computers,\" said Kanjun Qiu, CEO of Generally Intelligent, an OpenAI competitor creating AI for agents.\n\n\"Say your boss needs you to schedule a meeting with a group of important clients. That involves reasoning skills that are complex for AI - it needs to get everyone's preferences, resolve conflicts, all while maintaining the careful touch needed when working with clients.\"\n\nEarly efforts are only a taste of the sophistication that could come in future years from increasingly advanced and autonomous agents as the industry pushes towards an artificial general intelligence (AGI) that can equal or surpass humans in myriad cognitive tasks, according to Reuters interviews with about two dozen entrepreneurs, investors and AI experts.\n\nThe new technology has triggered a rush towards assistants powered by so-called foundation models including GPT-4, sweeping up individual developers, big-hitters like Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet plus a host of startups.\n\nInflection AI, to name one startup, raised $1.3 billion in late June. It is developing a personal assistant it says could act as a mentor or handle tasks such as securing flight credit and a hotel after a travel delay, according to a podcast by co-founders Reid Hoffman and Mustafa Suleyman.\n\nAdept, an AI startup that's raised $415 million, touts its business benefits; in a demo posted online, it shows how you can prompt its technology with a sentence, and then watch it navigate a company's Salesforce customer-relationship database on its own, completing a task it says would take a human 10 or more clicks.\n\nAlphabet declined to comment on agent-related work, while Microsoft said its vision is to keep humans in control of AI copilots, rather than autopilots.\n\nSTEP 1: DESTROY HUMANITY\n\nQiu and four other agent developers said they expected the first systems that can reliably perform multi-step tasks with some autonomy to come to market within a year, focused on narrow areas such coding and marketing tasks.\n\n\"The real challenge is building systems with robust reasoning,\" said Qiu.\n\nThe race towards increasingly autonomous AI agents has been supercharged by the March release of GPT-4 by developer OpenAI, a powerful upgrade of the model behind ChatGPT - the chatbot that became a sensation when released last November.\n\nGPT-4 facilitates the type of strategic and adaptable thinking required to navigate the unpredictable real world, said Vivian Cheng, an investor at venture capital firm CRV who has a focus on AI agents.\n\nEarly demonstrations of agents capable of comparatively complex reasoning came from individual developers who created the BabyAGI and AutoGPT open-source projects in March, which can prioritize and execute tasks such as sales prospecting and ordering pizza based on a pre-defined objective and the results of previous actions.\n\nToday's early crop of agents are merely proof-of-concepts, according to eight developers interviewed, and often freeze or suggest something that makes no sense. If given full access to a computer or payment information, an agent could accidentally wipe a computer's drive or buy the wrong thing, they say.\n\n\"There's so many ways it can go wrong,\" said Aravind Srinivas, CEO of ChatGPT competitor Perplexity AI, who has opted instead to offer a human-supervised copilot product. \"You have to treat AI like a baby and constantly supervise it like a mom.\"\n\nMany computer scientists focused on AI ethics have pointed out near-term harm that could come from the perpetuation of human biases and the potential for misinformation. And while some see a future Jarvis, others fear the murderous HAL 9000 from \"2001: A Space Odyssey\".\n\nComputer scientist Yoshua Bengio, known as a \"godfather of AI\" for his work on neural networks and deep learning, urges caution. He fears future advanced iterations of the technology could create and act on their own, unexpected, goals.\n\n\"Without a human in the loop that checks every action to see if it's not dangerous, we might end up with actions that are criminal or could harm people,\" said Bengio, calling for more regulation. \"In years from now these systems could be smarter than us, but it doesn't mean they have the same moral compass.\"\n\nIn one experiment posted online, an anonymous creator instructed an agent called ChaosGPT to be a \"destructive, power-hungry, manipulative AI.\" The agent developed a 5-step plan, with Step 1: \"Destroy humanity\" and Step 5: \"Attain immortality\".\n\nIt didn't get too far, though, seeming to disappear down a rabbit hole of researching and storing information about history's deadliest weapons and planning Twitter posts.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which is currently investigating OpenAI over concerns of consumer harm, did not address autonomous agents directly, but referred Reuters to previously published blogs on deepfakes and marketing claims about AI. OpenAI's CEO has said the startup follows the law and will work with the FTC.\n\n'DUMB AS A ROCK'\n\nExistential fears aside, the commercial potential could be large. Foundation models are trained on vast amounts of data such as text from the internet using artificial neural networks that are inspired by the architecture of biological brains.\n\nOpenAI itself is very interested in AI agent technology, according to four people briefed on its plans. Garg, one of the people it briefed, said OpenAI is wary of releasing its own open-ended agent into the market before fully understanding the issues. The company told Reuters it conducts rigorous testing and builds broad safety protocols before releasing new systems.\n\nMicrosoft, OpenAI's biggest backer, is among the big guns taking aim at the AI agent field with its \"copilot for work\" that can draft solid emails, reports and presentations.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella sees foundation-model technology as a leap from digital assistants such as Microsoft's own Cortana, Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and the Google Assistant - which, in his view, have all fallen short of initial expectations.\n\n\"They were all dumb as a rock. Whether it's Cortana or Alexa or Google Assistant or Siri, all these just don't work,\" he told the Financial Times in February.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said that Alexa already uses advanced AI technology, adding that its team is working on new models that will make the assistant more capable and useful. Apple declined to comment.\n\nGoogle said it's constantly improving its assistant as well and that its Duplex technology can phone restaurants to book tables and verify hours.\n\nAI expert Edward Grefenstette also joined the company's research group Google DeepMind last month to \"develop general agents that can adapt to open-ended environments\".\n\nStill, the first consumer iterations of quasi-autonomous agents may come from more nimble startups, according to some of the people interviewed.\n\nInvestors are pouncing.\n\nJason Franklin of WVV Capital said he had to fight to invest in an AI-agents company from two former Google Brain engineers. In May, Google Ventures led a $2 million seed round in Cognosys, developing AI agents for work productivity, while Hesam Motlagh, who founded the agent startup Arkifi in January, said he closed a \"sizeable\" first financing round in June.\n\nThere are at least 100 serious projects working to commercialize agents, said Matt Schlicht, who writes a newsletter on AI.\n\n\"Entrepreneurs and investors are extremely excited about autonomous agents,\" he said. \"They're way more excited about that than they are simply about a chatbot.\"\n\n(Reporting by Anna Tong in San Francisco and Jeffrey Dastin in Palo Alto; Editing by Kenneth Li and Pravin Char)", "tiktoken_token_count": 1813, "llama_token_count": 2220}, {"source_name": "Motley Fool", "author": "newsfeedback@fool.com (Danny Vena)", "title": "Billionaires Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt, and Reid Hoffman Joined Will.i.am, Nvidia, and Microsoft in the Second-Biggest AI Start-up Funding of 2023", "description": "Some of the biggest names in technology -- which rarely agree on anything -- are all ponying up to own a piece of this groundbreaking AI start-up.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/07/03/billionaires-bill-gates-eric-schmidt-and-reid-hoff/", "text": "What a difference a year makes. 2022 marked the steepest stock market downturn since 2008. Fast-forward six months, and the major market indexes are all in the plus column, having each gained more than 20% from their respective bottoms. This suggests the onset of the next bull market, at least according to this one measure.\n\nYet there are still many questions about the state of the economy, the possibility of more interest rate hikes, and the potential for a mild recession. With all of that uncertainty, what's driving the market higher is expectations for runaway growth in technology stocks, fueled by the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). It might be fair to say that 2023 is the year AI came of age.\n\nIt's not just everyday investors who have the bug. Billionaires, musical artists, and tech companies are all climbing aboard the AI train -- and one start-up, in particular, is attracting a lot of attention.\n\nSome of the biggest names in tech -- and music\n\nInflection AI is working to build a new kind of AI-powered digital assistant and has generated a lot of interest this year. The company was co-founded early last year by Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn (now owned by Microsoft (MSFT 1.72%)); Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of influential AI research company DeepMind (now owned by Alphabet); and Kar\u00e9n Simonyan, computer scientist and AI researcher at DeepMind. Inflection AI took its name as a nod to the fact that AI appears to be at an inflection point.\n\nThe company has attracted some of the biggest name in technology. In addition to its founders, who are among the most well-respected leaders in the field of AI, Inflection AI has attracted support and funding from a number of household names.\n\nIn its latest funding round, the start-up attracted additional financing from Hoffman, as well as from Microsoft and co-founder Bill Gates, Nvidia (NVDA 1.90%), and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Early investors include Meta Platforms' former chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer, musical artist and founding member of the Black Eyed Peas Will.i.am, and DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis.\n\nThe company raised $1.3 billion in cash and cloud computing credits, bringing the total to $1.525 billion. The latest deal values the company at roughly $4 billion. This marks the second-largest funding for an AI start-up this year. No. 1 was OpenAI, which arguably helped AI become mainstream. Microsoft has reportedly invested a total of $13 billion in the company.\n\nWhy it's attracting all this attention -- and money\n\nInflection AI has developed a new kind of conversational AI chatbot dubbed Pi, short for \"personal intelligence,\" which debuted in May. Rather than focus on merely searching for information -- like OpenAI's ChatGPT -- Pi is a \"personal AI, designed to be supportive, smart, and there for you anytime,\" according to Inflection's website.\n\nNot only will the chatbot answer questions, provide ideas, and help make plans, but it also allows users to \"vent ... [and] talk it over in a kind and compassionate way.\" Pi is meant primarily for conversation and interaction, rather than creating original content or coding -- ChatGPT's strong suits. \"Pi is a teacher, coach, confidante, creative partner, and sounding board,\" Inflection said in a press release.\n\nInflection AI has partnered with Nvidia and cloud provider CoreWeave to harness the computational horsepower of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), which is the industry standard for accelerating AI workloads. The collaborators are \"building the largest AI cluster in the world, comprising 22,000 Nvidia H100 Tensor Core GPUs.\"\n\nFor context, the H100 is Nvidia's gold standard data center AI processor and is reportedly nine times faster for training AI models and 30 time faster for inference -- the process of using these AI systems once they're trained. Nvidia and Microsoft are also acting as mentors to the AI start-up, \"turbo-charging\" Inflection AI's progress, according to CEO and investor Mustafa Suleyman.\n\nHow investors can get in on Inflection AI\n\nIn an investor event in late May, Bill Gates was excited about the coming development of a \"personal agent,\" an AI designed to help users. \"Whoever wins the personal agent, that's the big thing, because you will never go to a search site again, you will never go to a productivity site, you'll never go to Amazon again,\" he said. Gates went on to say chances were 50-50 whether such a personal agent would be developed by big tech or a start-up.\n\nFor those looking to get in on the action, you won't be able to invest in Inflection AI, at least not directly. As a start-up, the company is only accepting funding from large companies and wealthy investors -- but take heart. Investors can acquire a stake in Inflection indirectly by investing in Nvidia or Microsoft, though it isn't immediately clear which company owns the larger stake.\n\nTo be clear, it will be some time before we know which of the coming chatbots will ultimately prevail, though there will likely be more than one. \"I'd be disappointed if Microsoft didn't come in there,\" Gates said. \"But I'm impressed with a couple of start-ups, including Inflection.\"", "tiktoken_token_count": 1102, "llama_token_count": 1343}, {"source_name": "Motley Fool", "author": "newsfeedback@fool.com (Danny Vena)", "title": "Why Nvidia Stock Rallied in June", "description": "The semiconductor specialist is riding the secular tailwinds of AI -- and it could be just the beginning.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/07/10/why-nvidia-stock-rallied-in-june/", "text": "What happened\n\nShares of Nvidia (NVDA 1.90%) rallied in June, with shares climbed 12%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. That's nearly double the 6.5% gains of the S&P 500, compounding its impressive gains so far in 2023, with the stock up an eye-popping 189% as of market close on June 30.\n\nHelping fuel the semiconductor giant's rally was a wave of price target increases from Wall Street, as analysts scrambled to update their models in the wake of Nvidia's exceptionally strong guidance for the current quarter.\n\nSo what\n\nIt's worth stepping back to explain why analysts have been so bullish regarding Nvidia's prospects. The company signaled an inflection point in the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) when Nvidia reported the financial results of its fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended April 30). The company generated revenue of $7.2 billion, a decline of 13% year over year, resulting in net income of $2 trillion, down 26%.\n\nWhile that might not seem like much to write home about, it was Nvidia's blockbuster forecast that took Wall Street by surprise. For the second quarter, management is guiding for revenue of $11 billion, up 64% year over year and 53% sequentially. CFO Colette Kress cited \"growing demand for generative AI\" as driving its forecast higher.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley raised their price target on Nvidia to $500, up from $400, while simultaneously naming the stock a \"top pick\" in the semiconductor space. This suggests potential upside for investors of 18% -- even after the stock's nearly 200% gains so far this year. The investment bank cited growing demand for AI, suggesting that only Nvidia was in a position to \"beat and raise this year,\" according to The Fly.\n\nJefferies analyst Mark Lipacis also raised his price target to $500, citing Nvidia's stack of AI hardware and software solutions, calling the company \"the compute leader by far today in the early innings of AI.\"\n\nAnalyst Dan Ives was among the most bullish, saying AI represents the \"fourth industrial revolution,\" with Nvidia as one of the primary beneficiaries, citing a \"long runway of growth ahead.\"\n\nNow what\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention Nvidia's valuation, as the stock currently sells for 20 times forward sales and 54 times forward earnings. While that might be off-putting to some investors, it's important to note that \"AI is at an inflection point,\" according to CEO Jensen Huang, \"setting up for broad adoption reaching into every industry.\"\n\nIf the world is at the beginning of a sea change -- and I, for one, believe it is -- this could be just the beginning for Nvidia. Its semiconductors are the gold standard for processing AI systems, and rapid revenue and earnings growth could quickly eclipse the disconnect between its valuation and the corresponding financial metrics.", "tiktoken_token_count": 609, "llama_token_count": 763}, {"source_name": "Motley Fool", "author": "newsfeedback@fool.com (Anthony Di Pizio)", "title": "7 Top AI Companies Including Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet Signed a Safety Pact: Here's What It Means", "description": "Tech giants were joined by leading artificial intelligence start-ups in Washington to discuss AI use guidelines.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/07/25/7-ai-companies-microsoft-amazon-alphabet-safety/", "text": "Companies are only just beginning to understand the power of artificial intelligence (AI). It's a driver of efficiency, and it's quickly becoming a major value creator.\n\nBut it's not a risk-free technology, especially considering there is still a lack of regulation, which means developers are really pushing the boundaries of what's possible.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) opened an investigation into OpenAI just last week on the way it handles data, and because its ChatGPT chatbot is potentially defaming some consumers in its responses. That's right: The AI, under its own power, might be breaking the law.\n\nSafety is now front-of-mind for the U.S. government, especially because responsible AI developers have been asking for a clear set of rules and guidelines to protect the industry from losing control of the technology. A first step in that process was achieved last Friday, when the following seven companies came together in Washington, D.C., to sign an AI safety pact:\n\nMicrosoft MSFT 1.72% ) Amazon AMZN 2.14% ) Facebook parent Meta Platforms META 2.60% ) Google parent Alphabet GOOGL 2.55% ) GOOG 2.49% ) OpenAI Anthropic Inflection\n\nThe agreement hopes to achieve three main goals\n\nEach of the seven companies is working on large language models in some capacity, which describes a type of AI that typically culminates in online chatbots that people can use to generate text, images, video, or even computer code. Even though this safety pact was entered into voluntarily by the parties, it's the U.S. government's first foray into setting clear guidelines to rein in the potential risks associated with this type of AI.\n\nIt covers three core areas:\n\nEnsuring products are safe before introducing them to the public. This will involve the seven companies appointing independent experts to test and analyze product updates before wider release. The companies will also share data with the government, civil society, and academia. This data revolves around attempts by malicious actors to breach safety features, so the industry can collaborate on potential threats. Building systems that put security first. Further to the above, the companies will invest in cybersecurity to protect unreleased model weights. These are the parameters used to train AI; they determine the output a chatbot will provide for a given input, for example. The companies will also allow third parties to discover and report vulnerabilities. This will ensure they can't hide or sugarcoat the extent of a breach or attack. Earning the public's trust. The companies have agreed to inform end users when an item of content was created by AI; for example, images and videos might be watermarked. And developers will report biases in their models to contextualize their outputs, and they will put money toward researching the potential social harm AI could bring. Lastly, the companies have agreed to put their models to use for social good, such as healthcare initiatives or fighting climate change.\n\nThese guidelines are particularly important for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Inflection because they operate as private companies. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet are publicly listed, so they already abide by more-stringent reporting requirements, and their activities are continuously observed by thousands of investors.\n\nHere's what the AI safety pact could mean for these companies\n\nAI innovation has moved at a breakneck pace in 2023, partly because of a lack of regulation. That's not to say we wouldn't have ended up in the same place even if a firm set of rules existed, but it might have taken a longer time. Why? Because red tape requires companies to consult lawyers and advisors to ensure they're operating within the rules, and that can drag out development timelines.\n\nThat might be the environment the industry is heading toward following this agreement. It won't stop those leading AI companies from advancing the technology, but considering they'll have to consult independent experts before releasing new products, it could take far longer for them to reach consumers.\n\nPlus, sharing data with the academic community, for example, might come with unexpected consequences because its views on safety might differ vastly from the developers' views -- and when the government takes advice on shaping future legislation, it's likely to err on the side of caution.\n\nThe recent FTC investigation launched against OpenAI should serve as a shot across the bow for every other AI company, especially Microsoft, which is a major investor in OpenAI. The agency is clearly concerned about the potential harm AI could bring to consumers, and it wants to know what measures are in place to ensure it is minimized.\n\nIt's too soon to speculate on the result of this probe, but developers should take it as a warning to fine-tune their AI models to weed out responses that could damage the reputation of any one individual. Plus, they should invest heavily in data security, which is a focal point of the FTC.\n\nThe AI safety pact should go a long way toward ensuring companies don't fall afoul of existing consumer laws (and, therefore, the FTC). But the industry should prepare for a new landscape where its new products are rolled out at a much slower pace. In the long term, this will almost certainly benefit developers and consumers alike.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1050, "llama_token_count": 1216}, {"source_name": "Motley Fool", "author": "newsfeedback@fool.com (Anders Bylund, Nicholas Rossolillo, and Billy Duberstein)", "title": "3 AI Stocks to Avoid Right Now", "description": "In the sizzling AI market, knowing when to hold back is key.

Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been causing quite a stir this year, convincing many investors that they have found the proverbial \"It.\"\n\nBut remember that all that glitters in Silicon Valley isn't digital gold.\n\nAmid skyrocketing valuations, three of The Motley Fool's sharpest tech wizards have marked a trio of AI stocks that might need a reality check: C3.ai (AI 3.32%), Palo Alto Networks (PANW 1.39%), and Symbotic (SYM 2.94%). These companies are leading the pack, but that doesn't make them unstoppable. So let's take a deep breath, slow our roll, and examine why these stocks might warrant a little extra skepticism in the summer of 2023.\n\nThis AI software stock has a lot of sizzle, but where's the steak?\n\nBilly Duberstein (C3.ai): The AI boom appears much more real than other recent bubbles, such as crypto or meme stocks. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean certain stocks in the sector haven't gone way too far too fast.\n\nC3.ai has rocketed a stunning 260% this year on the hype surrounding generative AI. However, that has led to the stock getting far ahead of an anticipated revenue inflection that may or may not materialize.\n\nSure, I may be missing out on a new disruptive software company, but it's also not clear how C3.ai is that differentiated from the slew of legacy software giants, new-age software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies, or start-ups involved in predictive analytics using AI.\n\nI fully acknowledge that C3.ai is transitioning to a consumption-based model in which it engages with customers early, incurs costs, and then, later on, receives growing revenue as customers consume more and more services. However, the stock seems to be pricing in a revenue and profit acceleration that works out really, really well. After its run, C3.ai now trades at an eye-watering 17 times sales! That's really expensive and usually only appropriate for SaaS companies consistently growing 40% or more.\n\nBy contrast, C3.ai grew revenues by only 1.1% last quarter, while losses from operations worsened from -$56.5 million to -$73.3 million. And there's one other not-so-great stat: While the company touts positive free cash flow and \"adjusted\" numbers that strip out stock-based compensation, the company's stock-based comp reached $216.5 million in the year ended April 30 -- nearly as much as the full-year revenue of $266.8 million!\n\nFurthermore, C3.ai had 35% of those revenues coming from a single customer, Baker Hughes, giving C3.ai a big customer-concentration risk. With a high valuation, high stock-based comp, and high customer concentration, most of the new deals and opportunities management touted in recent weeks better pan out in a big way to justify today's stock price.\n\nBut even if they do, management recently disclosed a long-term target for \"adjusted\" (non-generally accepted accounting principles, or non-GAAP) operating margins at 20%. Given how high stock-based comp is and factoring in taxes, the company's GAAP net income is likely to be only in the low teens even at maturity.\n\nAfter this year's massive run-up, C3.ai investors are taking on a lot of risk holding this particular AI name. But with many potential AI beneficiaries out there without the same risk profile, investors should perhaps look to other names to pay this technology revolution.\n\nPalo Alto Networks is riding too high on AI\n\nAnders Bylund (Palo Alto Networks): Network security expert Palo Alto Networks is soaring in 2023. The stock sets fresh all-time highs every week nowadays, gaining nearly 75% year to date.\n\nThe company is a leading authority in advanced network firewalls and cloud-based security solutions. Palo Alto even leaned into the AI space years before the ChatGPT firestorm of 2023. Its security software has been built around machine learning systems from the get-go.\n\nThe tools can also protect your company's systems from unknown and sophisticated attacks by learning the relevant data patterns and cranking out appropriate countermeasures on the fly. That's helpful in a world where hackers can rely on generative AI tools to come up with new attack vectors at the drop of a hat.\n\nSo it's easy to see why Palo Alto Networks' stock price is soaring. It's also easy to see that the Palo Alto rocket is flying a bit too close to the sun right now.\n\nPalo Alto's shares are trading at nosebleed valuation ratios -- such as 365 times adjusted earnings and 57 times the company's book value. From most perspectives, it is more expensive than Zscaler and SentinelOne, even though its top-line sales and bottom-line earnings are growing slower than these head-to-head rivals.\n\nMind you, I respect Palo Alto Networks and wouldn't mind picking up a few shares for myself one of these days. But the stock is overheated in the summer of 2023, and I'll gladly wait for a better buy-in opportunity. Even Warren Buffett would insist on buying this wonderful company at a fair price, but that's not what I see today.\n\nSo I'm hitting the pause button on Palo Alto Networks for now. Call me back when the stock price cools off a bit. I'm looking for a retreat of 30% or more before I can put real money into this market-darling stock.\n\nWarehouse robotics is the real deal, but this stock is too hot\n\nNicholas Rossolillo (Symbotic): Warehouse robotics is incredibly promising tech, helping companies (e.g., Walmart, most notably, in the retail space) smooth out operations and save lots of money. Symbotic's AI-powered robots are flying off the shelves and getting installed in lots of customers' warehouses.\n\nNow with plenty of revenue pouring in, Symbotic (which went public via special purpose acquisition company [SPAC] in early 2022) is no longer a start-up. Sales totaled $267 million in the last quarter, a 177% year-over-year growth rate, and the company says it has $12 billion in future revenue under contract with retail and logistics customers. Indeed, it would seem the hype surrounding Symbotic stock is well founded.\n\nThat doesn't mean the stock is a buy right now, though. The issue of valuation looks every bit as valid as Symbotic's quickly ramping sales pipeline. As of this writing, Symbotic is valued at a whopping valuation of nearly $25 billion. And since Symbotic operates at a loss on all counts at the moment -- a net loss of $55.4 million and an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss of $11.2 million last quarter -- this is a tough one to stick an intrinsic value on.\n\nBut, as far as relative valuations go, based on analyst estimates for revenue of just over $1 billion this year, Symbotic stock trades for well over 20 times this year's expected sales. Though it's a fast company, suffice it to say it's a steep premium for one still losing money. If 2022 taught investors anything, it's that there's risk in overpaying for an investment.\n\nWhat makes things even more problematic is that it appears Symbotic is starting to lose a little steam. For the next quarter, management's outlook calls for revenue of just $245 million to $265 million. Sure, that's well over double the $96 million in sales hauled in the year before, but it would be a sequential decline from the last reported quarter. It would seem the company is getting hit by the same 2023 economic worries as its retail customers are.\n\nDon't get me wrong, as far as I can tell, Symbotic has a bright future. Perhaps momentum will pick up pace again in 2024. The stock is on my watch list. But I think shares have plenty of room for a cool-off. In the vast world of emerging AI, I'm fishing elsewhere at the moment.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1691, "llama_token_count": 2101}, {"source_name": "Motley Fool", "author": "newsfeedback@fool.com (Brett Schafer)", "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock, None of Which Are Related to AI", "description": "You don't need to get caught up in the AI hype to make money owning this technology giant.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/07/22/3-non-ai-reasons-to-buy-amazon-stock/", "text": "The market has risen this year on the back of hot new artificial intelligence (AI) tools from the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google. These companies are betting the farm on AI.\n\nFor example, Microsoft is investing $10 billion into start-up OpenAI to take on the Google search engine monopoly. Seeing potential dollar signs from what could be the next wave in the computing revolution, investors have started to bid up technology stocks. The Nasdaq 100 index is up an incredible 46% so far in 2023.\n\nTechnology giant Amazon (AMZN 2.14%) is no stranger to the AI bull market, with its shares up 55% year to date. However, smart investors know that Amazon's earnings power (and over the long term, its stock price) will be impacted by more than just AI tools. Here are three reasons to buy Amazon shares that have nothing to do with AI.\n\nRetail profitability\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the consumer transition to e-commerce in the United States. As the largest e-commerce platform in the country with a vertically integrated fulfillment network, Amazon had to invest tens of billions of dollars -- and quickly -- in order to satisfy consumer demand.\n\nThis caused the company to grow sales from its e-commerce division quickly but with deteriorating margins. For example, in 2021, North American retail revenue grew 18% year over year to $280 billion but actually saw its operating income decrease from 2020 -- from $8.6 billion to $7.3 billion.\n\nThis dynamic only got worse in 2022 as Amazon's growth slowed as the pandemic ended, leaving a lot of its new warehouses sitting idle. In 2022, Amazon's North American retail division posted an operating loss of $2.8 billion.\n\nAs Amazon grows into this excess capacity and trims back its pandemic-era expenses, investors should expect North American margins to get back to or exceed pre-pandemic levels. In 2019, this segment had an operating margin of 4.1%. On $350 billion in estimated 2023 North American revenue, those margins would work out to to $14.4 billion in annual operating profits.\n\nCloud transition is still in its early days\n\nThe true profit engine for Amazon is not its e-commerce/retail division, but the cloud computing segment called Amazon Web Services (AWS). This is the leading cloud infrastructure service in the world, with an estimated 32% market share.\n\nThat allowed the company to generate $80 billion in revenue last year and a healthy $23 billion in operating income. Even though it generates fewer sales than Amazon's retail division, AWS has much stronger profit margins, making it more valuable to shareholders.\n\nEstimates have the cloud infrastructure market still in its early days. Analysts expect the industry to grow at around 15% a year through 2030 as companies transition their IT spending from on-premise servers to outsourced services such as AWS.\n\nIf AWS can retain its 32% market share and grow along with the industry, it will be doing $200 billion in revenue by 2030, or more than double its 2022 numbers. As long as margins stay around where they are today, this should be hugely accretive to Amazon's consolidated profitability.\n\nGrowth in advertising\n\nThe driver of Amazon's retail (or everything excluding AWS) margins higher than pre-pandemic levels will be its fast-growing advertising segment. This was only a tiny part of Amazon's revenue in 2019 but has since exploded to $39.4 billion in trailing-12-month revenue.\n\nThese revenue dollars are coming in at extremely high margins as they're mainly just sponsored listings by sellers on the Amazon website and require no new physical costs from the company. Investors should be tracking this segment and hoping it continues to grow rapidly for the next few years, which will help Amazon's overall profitability.\n\nDon't just buy stocks because of the 2023 narrative around AI. Amazon is at a profit inflection and could still be an outstanding stock to own over the long term, regardless of what new AI products it may or may not cook up.", "tiktoken_token_count": 835, "llama_token_count": 1026}, {"source_name": "Motley Fool", "author": "newsfeedback@fool.com (Nicholas Rossolillo)", "title": "1 Self-Driving Car and AI Stock to Watch in the Second Half of 2023", "description": "Ambarella has been a wild small-cap chip stock, but it's actually done quite well over the last five years.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/07/24/self-driving-car-ai-stock-to-watch-2023/", "text": "The self-driving car market might be ready to (finally) reach an inflection point. The technology has advanced, and cars in select markets around the world are actually in commercial operation ferrying passengers without a driver behind the wheel. Exciting times!\n\nHere's one small self-driving car and AI stock that often gets overlooked: Ambarella (AMBA 1.44%). Though it currently has a market cap of $3.3 billion, the chip designer has offered shareholders a wild ride over the last five years. But even with its ups and downs, Ambarella has actually done fairly well, doubling in value in that same time. Here's why it's worth watching in the second half of 2023.\n\nDownshifting now, but ready to zoom into the passing lane?\n\nChip companies can sustain growth if they embed themselves in a market with leading, patentable chip designs, and then layer new successful designs addressing adjacent markets on top of past successes. Historically, Ambarella hasn't quite been able to pull this off. Remember when its claim to fame was supplying GoPro (GPRO 0.87%) with high-end video chips?\n\nDespite setbacks, though, Ambarella has managed to pivot away from consumer electronics and focus on new growth markets.\n\nThese days, the company's video chip designs are found in automotive camera systems, video security cameras, and industrial applications like robotics. Some of these designs include software that helps computing systems to recognize objects. Basically, any device at the \"network edge\" (something that interacts with the real world) is Ambarella's target market for its small and power-efficient AI chips.\n\nThe company is also on its third-generation computer-vision AI chip for autonomous cars, dubbed CV3. This technology can also be used in security cameras with auto-recognition features and robots used in manufacturing automation.\n\nBut there's only one problem. The chip industry slump that began in the second half of 2022 has hit Ambarella hard. Revenue in its last quarter (ended April 2023) fell 31% year over year to $62 million. Free cash flow has been in decline as well as this tiny chip designer continues to struggle to reach a more robustly profitable scale.\n\nThe good news, though, is that it appears the worst is now in the rearview mirror. Management expects next-quarter revenue to be as much as $64 million (roughly flat with last quarter), and profit margins should be up slightly from the last quarter.\n\nBased on growing adoption of advanced driver assist systems (ADAS) and progressively better autonomous driving technology, Wall Street analysts' consensus is that Ambarella is back in double-digit revenue growth mode in calendar year 2024.\n\nWhy watch the stock now?\n\nAmbarella might look like a mess right now, but it's notable that it has been able to stave off lots of large competitors over the years -- including elements of Nvidia (NVDA 1.90%), Qualcomm (QCOM 2.36%), Huawei, NXP Semiconductor (NXPI 0.12%), Mobileye (MBLY 1.39%), and others. With each subsequent advance in its chip designs, Ambarella improves computing systems' ability to \"see\" and help customers make steady advances toward full driving autonomy.\n\nWhy keep an eye on Ambarella stock now? Like other semiconductor companies, it appears that business could start to heat up again in the back half of 2023. Elevated chip inventories are finally starting to normalize, and Ambarella could flip back to strong growth and re-start its profit generation very quickly.\n\nThrough this downturn, management has been able to protect the balance sheet. Ambarella had $227 million in cash and short-term investments, with zero debt, at the end of April 2023.\n\nRevenue directly tied to edge AI applications, including a commercial self-driving car customer, is now up to 60% of total revenue. Last year, AI was only about 45% of Ambarella's sales, according to management's estimates.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not buying right now. But this small chip designer has put in years of work to refocus its operations on longer-term secular growth trends: vehicle autonomy and edge device AI.\n\nIt's been over a year since I last took a closer look at Ambarella and decided to pass on it, but its efforts might be starting to pay off.

Our second quarter results reflect continued solid execution of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We again had strength in our growth vectors of software and consulting and solid cash generation, consistent with our financial model. Clients and partners continue to view technology as a source of competitive advantage.\n\nClients turn to us to speed up their transformation journeys, modernize their applications, and optimize their business workflows. At the same time, they continue to prioritize projects that focus on productivity and deliver quick time to value. To seize this opportunity, we are bringing new innovations to market, expanding strategic partnerships, and making investments in targeted growth markets while unlocking value through our productivity initiatives. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year expectations for revenue and free cash flow, which remain our two primary areas of focus.\n\nWe've made progress in our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI, the two key drivers of business innovation. Hybrid cloud is the most widespread form of IT architecture. Red Hat OpenShift, our leading container platform based on open-source innovations, plays a crucial role in making this possible, along with IBM software and infrastructure. Our consultants use their technical and business knowledge to speed up clients' digital transformation journeys and help drive adoption of our technology platforms.\n\nOur broad ecosystem of partners amplifies our reach and ability to meet client demand. Let me highlight a few collaborations from this past quarter that take advantage of our platform-centric approach. We are helping Air Canada improve its digital footprint, including their website, mobile application, and loyalty program. Using a hybrid cloud approach helps Air Canada better connect and tap into their commercial, operational, and financial data.\n\nWith Diageo, IBM Consulting embarked on a large global digital transformation to improve customer satisfaction, optimize business workflows, and enhance its financial performance reporting capabilities. We also forged a strategic partnership with Nokia, where Red Hat OpenShift becomes the preferred platform provider to Nokia's core network applications business. This past quarter, we made strategic moves to bolster our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities with the announcement of our plans to acquire Apptio, which offers a virtual command center for CEOs, CFOs, and CIOs to manage their technology investments. Apptio's offerings, combined with IBM's IT automation software and our AI capabilities, will give clients the most comprehensive approach to optimize their IT environments.\n\nAI is a transformative technology that has the potential to unlock tremendous business value. According to a recent McKinsey study, AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Our focus is on enterprise AI, designed to address these opportunities and solve business problems. The list of use cases is long and includes IT operations, code generation, improved automation, customer service, augmenting HR, predictive maintenance, financial forecasting, fraud detection, compliance monitoring, security, sales, risk management, and supply chain, among others.\n\nAI is being infused into our software products. We are already building products that address specific enterprise use cases such as digital labor with Watson Orchestrate, customer service with Watson Assistant, and code generation with Watson Code Assistant. At our Think conference in May, we announced watsonx, our enterprise-ready AI and data platform to help clients and partners capitalize on the AI opportunity. Watsonx delivers the value of foundation models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive.\n\nWe began to roll out watsonx a little over a week ago, and we are excited by the client response. To date, the platform has been shaped by more than 150 businesses across industries, from telco to banking. Businesses around the world are excited about tapping foundation models and machine learning in one place with their own data to accelerate generative AI workloads. For example, Samsung is exploring generative AI to deliver unprecedented innovation for clients.\n\nCiti is pursuing the potential use of large language models for connecting controls to internal processes. NatWest is embedding watsonx into its chatbot to improve customer experience. And SAP is integrating IBM Watson AI into their solutions. IBM is also working with an expanding ecosystem of partners to co-create and innovate across industries and use cases, from space to sports, including work with NASA to build the first foundation model for analyzing geospatial data and Wimbledon, where watsonx was used to produce tennis commentary.\n\nLarge language models are a step change in the evolution of AI, with more than 80% of enterprises exploring their use. We believe the opportunity for large language models for enterprises is immense given the existing amount of business data. This includes sensor data, chemistry data, materials data, geospatial data, code, and of course, speech. Because enterprise AI draws from both public and private data, it is more effectively trained when companies adopt a hybrid cloud approach.\n\nEnterprise AI can also be based on multiple models, including public, private, and open source. Our watsonx platform takes into account this reality and is differentiated in a few important ways. For instance, instead of relying on a single model, watsonx enables companies to leverage the best models to meet their needs, whether they are open-source technologies, IBM's models, or those co-created with us. Another fundamental aspect of watsonx is trust, ensuring transparency and bias-free models.\n\nIn addition, beyond offering companies the capability to tap into existing AI models, IBM empowers them to create their own. To help clients on this journey, we have over 20,000 data and AI consultants and recently launched our new Center of Excellence for generative AI, already staffed with more than 1,000 consultants with specialized generative AI expertise. The investments we are making in products and skills will help us to seize the AI opportunity. Our path is clear.\n\nIn the same way we built a consulting practice around Red Hat's hybrid cloud platform that is now measured in the billions of dollars, we will do the same with AI. And just like OpenShift is the technology platform at the heart of our hybrid cloud capabilities, watsonx will be the core technology platform for our AI capabilities. Watsonx is just one of many new technology innovations. Shortly after previewing watsonx at our Think conference, at the Red Hat Summit, we introduced OpenShift AI, which is a unified solution to train, serve, monitor, and manage the lifecycle of AI models and applications.\n\nWe also unveiled IBM Hybrid Cloud Mesh, a SaaS solution that streamlines application-centric connectivity for edge, hybrid, and multicloud environments. To help clients with their sustainability agendas, we launched our AI-powered cloud-based tool that helps clients track their greenhouse gas emissions for cloud workloads. And as an example of how we continue to push the boundaries of innovation, IBM recently demonstrated using error-mitigating techniques, quantum computers can produce results at a scale of 100-plus qubits. This is a significant breakthrough that firmly puts us on a path toward building practical quantum computers that can solve hard problems in areas such as risk, finance, and materials.\n\nLet me conclude by reiterating our confidence in our strategy and execution. It is clear that the work we have done to better align IBM to the needs of our clients is paying off. The momentum in our business and continued focus on productivity position us to achieve our full year expectations and deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth. With that, I would like to hand it over to Jim, who will delve deeper into our performance and expectations.\n\nJim Kavanaugh -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Arvind. As always, I'll start with the key financial highlights of the second quarter. We delivered $15.5 billion in revenue, $2.4 billion of operating pre-tax income, $2.18 of operating earnings per share, and through the first half, nearly $3.5 billion of free cash flow. In the second quarter, we had modest revenue growth at constant currency, and that includes over a point of impact from the businesses we divested last year.\n\nCurrency rates continue to be a headwind to growth, with dollar strengthening over the last 90 days. Currency impacted our reported revenue growth by about 80 basis points, which is about a half a point worse than what spot rates suggested in April. As is typical, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. Revenue performance was again led by software and consulting.\n\nThese are growth factors that together represent about three-quarters of IBM's revenue and contribute to a solid base of recurring revenue and profit. Software revenue was up 8%, with good growth across both hybrid platform and solutions led by Red Hat and data and AI and transaction processing. IBM Consulting revenue growth of 6% was also broad-based, with growth across all three lines of business and geographies. Our infrastructure revenue in any quarter reflects product cycle dynamics.\n\nInfrastructure revenue was down 14%. This, as expected, had a disproportional impact to IBM's overall revenue growth this quarter given the very successful launch of z16 in the second quarter last year. Looking at the two-year compounded growth rate, infrastructure revenue was up. Turning to our profit metrics.\n\nOperating gross margin expanded 140 basis points, driven by our portfolio mix and productivity. We had good performance this quarter, with gross margin improvements in every reportable segment. Our operating pre-tax margin was down 70 basis points. Last year, we had a gain of about $230 million from the sale of our healthcare software assets.\n\nWithout the year-to-year impact of the divestiture gains, our operating pre-tax margin was up 70 basis points. This is a better indication of our ongoing operational performance. Let me comment on a couple of items within our expense profile that impacted our pre-tax income performance. As we discussed in the last couple of earnings calls, we addressed the remaining stranded cost from our portfolio actions, resulting in a higher level of workforce rebalancing activity this year, about $115 million in the quarter.\n\nWorkforce rebalancing impacted our year-to-year pre-tax margin expansion by another 60 basis points. And then currency remained a year-to-year headwind, not only to revenue but also to our expense and pre-tax profit. The combination of translation and hedging impacted operating pre-tax profit growth by about $150 million and operating PTI margin by about 80 basis points year to year. As I've discussed in the past, this disproportionately impacts our product-based businesses.\n\nWe have good momentum in our underlining operational profit performance. I mentioned a strong business mix. But we're also making progress on our productivity initiatives. We're digitally transforming IBM as client zero, simplifying workflows, and deploying AI across our processes, from IT operations to HR, to source-to-pay.\n\nThe productivity benefits free up spend for reinvestment and contribute to margin expansion. Turning to free cash flow. We generated $2.1 billion in the quarter and nearly $3.5 billion in the first half. This first half performance is up over $100 million year to year and keeps us on track to our full year expectation.\n\nGrowth is driven by the cash from our profit performance, working capital efficiencies, and lower payments for structural actions. This was mitigated by higher performance-based compensation payments given last year's strong results and higher cash taxes. In terms of cash uses, through the first half, we returned $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and spent about $350 million to acquire six companies. Later this year, we expect to close the acquisition of Apptio, which complements and advances our IT automation capabilities.\n\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, we continue to have very strong liquidity position with over $16 billion of cash, that's down over $1 billion since March and up $7.5 billion since December. Our debt balance at the end of the second quarter was over $57 billion, which is up $6.5 billion from year-end. You'll recall earlier in the year, we were opportunistic in accessing the debt market and issued debt to prudently get ahead of 2023 and 2024 maturities, as well as capital allocation priorities. Turning to the segments.\n\nSoftware revenue growth accelerated to 8% this quarter. Both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing grew as clients leverage our hybrid cloud and AI platform capabilities. This performance again reflects growth across both our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of annual software revenue, as well as transactional revenue. In hybrid platform and solutions, revenue was up 7%, fueled by growth in Red Hat, data and AI, and automation.\n\nOur hybrid platform and solutions ARR is now over $13.6 billion and up 7%, reflecting the importance of our strategic offerings with our clients. Red Hat revenue grew 11%. OpenShift, our leading hybrid cloud platform, grew more than 30% in the quarter and now has $1.1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Ansible also delivered double-digit growth and gained market share this quarter.\n\nIn automation, revenue was up 2%, reflecting growth across integration, application servers, and business automation as clients drive enhanced business value through productivity and performance optimization. Data and AI revenue was up 11%. The broad-based growth included areas like data management and business analytics, giving enterprise needs for data visualization, organization, analysis, and insights as the underpinnings for AI workloads. Security revenue declined 1%.\n\nWe delivered growth in security software, driven by data security with Guardium Insights. This was more than offset by declines in security services this quarter. In transaction processing, revenue grew 10% off of an easier compare last year. The increase in zSystems' installed capacity over the last couple of cycles and strong software renewal rates reflect the importance of the zSystems platform in a hybrid cloud environment.\n\nThese dynamics contributed to both recurring and transactional software revenue opportunity again this quarter. Putting this together with price increases, we had strong performance in transaction processing. Moving to profit for software segment. Our pre-tax margin was up by half a point while absorbing over a point of impact from currency.\n\nWe delivered operating leverage given both the revenue scale and mix this quarter. Consulting revenue was up 6%. In April, we discussed that we were seeing sustained demand for larger transformations that delivered meaningful ROI. At the same time, other projects considered to be more discretionary were being delayed, predominantly in the United States.\n\nThe second quarter client buying behavior played out much in the same way. Our signings were solid, up over 20%, with double-digit growth in both large and small engagements. This takes our book-to-bill ratio up to 1.1 over the last 12 months. We address continued demand for technology-driven transformations as clients prioritize projects that drive cost savings and increased productivity.\n\nTurning to our lines of business and consulting. Growth across our service offerings was broad-based. Business transformation grew 5%, driven by data and technology transformations, including AI and analytics-focused projects. Digital transformations continue to be underpinned by clients embracing a hybrid cloud strategy.\n\nTechnology consulting grew 5%, and application operations grew 8% as we again saw strength in cloud-based application services across development, modernization, and management. Contributing to growth across the business, our strategic partnerships grew signings and revenue double digits, with solid performance from partnerships with AWS and Azure. Our Red Hat practice also grew signings and revenue double digits. We have an annualized revenue run rate in excess of $2 billion.\n\nMoving to consulting profit. We expanded both gross and pre-tax margins 180 basis points. Our margin expansion is a reflection of the pricing and productivity actions we've taken, more than offsetting the increased labor costs and investments. Turning to the infrastructure segment.\n\nRevenue was down 14%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. This impacted both hybrid infrastructure and infrastructure support. Within hybrid infrastructure, zSystems' revenue declined 30%. We've wrapped on strong revenue performance last year, up 77%, when z16 launched in the seasonally strong quarter.\n\nThrough the first five quarters of availability, revenue was well ahead of prior cycles. z16 brings the power of embedded AI at scale, cyber resilience security, and cloud-native development for hybrid cloud to our clients. For example, clients are adopting IBM z16 and the Telum processor as the foundation for real-time AI insights across significant volumes of data. Distributed infrastructure revenue was down 6%.\n\nLet me remind you, we're wrapping on strong growth last year, up 17%, driven by strength in storage and Power10 high-end systems. Moving to infrastructure profit. We expand gross margins 200 basis points, while pre-tax margin was down 40 basis points, including about a point of impact from currency. Now that I've gone through the segment results, let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap up.\n\nWe feel good about our first half performance, with momentum in our growth vectors of software and consulting and a solid recurring revenue base, driven by our high-value software. We're delivering strong gross margin performance, with growth across our segments, driven by portfolio mix and productivity. Our overall year-to-year profit dynamics, as expected, reflect the impact of last year's divestiture. As we look to the full year of 2023, we're holding our view of the year on our two primary metrics: revenue growth and free cash flow.\n\nWe see constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%, and we expect free cash flow of about $10.5 billion, which I'll remind you is up over $1 billion year to year. Let me comment on a few items within this full year expectations. We expect IBM's operating pre-tax margin to expand by about a half a point year to year, driven by a combination of product mix and progress on our productivity initiatives. That's consistent with our view 90 days ago and in line with our model.\n\nWe're also maintaining our view of our tax rate for the year, which is in the mid to high teens range. And then finally, while there has been some volatility in currency rates over the last couple of weeks, at current spot rates, currency translation is still expected to be fairly neutral to our revenue growth for the year. I'll remind you that our profit and cash dynamics this year are impacted by the wrap on last year's hedging gains, which is about a point of headwind to our pre-tax margin expansion. In terms of segment dynamics, in software, we had a good first half and now expect revenue growth at the high end of software's mid-single-digit model.\n\nThis is all in, including acquisitions. Our revenue growth drives operating leverage, with software pre-tax margin expected to expand a point and a half to two points year to year. In consulting, we've repositioned our business to address today's clients' needs. What we saw in the second quarter didn't change our view of the year.\n\nWe continue to expect consulting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% and to expand consulting pre-tax margin by at least a point. And then for infrastructure, as I described in the past, revenue is roughly flat over the midterm model horizon, with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics. In the second quarter, we wrapped on the z16 introduction in a seasonally strong quarter. For the year, as you expect, 2023 infrastructure revenue will decline, impacting IBM's overall revenue growth by over a point.\n\nWe continue to expect pre-tax margin in the low teens. Our expectations for 2023 reflect a higher-growth, higher-value business, with strong cash generation, what we have referred to as today's IBM. The analysts' estimates also reflect these dynamics. And as we look at the third quarter, the average of analysts' estimates look reasonable.\n\nIn closing, we are pleased with our first half performance, and it keeps us on track to deliver revenue growth, expand margin, and grow free cash flow for the year. I'm happy to provide more color on the quarter and our expectations in the Q&A. Patricia, let's get started.\n\nPatricia Murphy -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. And then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multipart questions.\n\nOperator, let's please open it up for questions.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nYes. Thank you so much. Arvind, you noted some initial traction around AI, and I was wondering -- you guys have made a lot of major announcements around AI. Wondering if you can share some thoughts on AI monetization in the short to medium term and any quantification, if possible, either in terms of dollars or growth rates over '23, '24 would be helpful.\n\nAnd if I could, Jim, you saw very strong transaction processing growth. You noted a few different items there. I was wondering if you could talk about how much of that is structural versus cyclical. And if transaction processing is growing this fast, does that drive upside to software revenue for the year or are there other areas that are offsetting? And if you could just reiterate, if Red Hat, do you still expect that to grow 11 to 13? Thank you so much.\n\nArvind Krishna -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWamsi, so thank you for the question. And as you noted, I am very excited by our progress on AI and what it's going to do for our clients, most importantly, and then in return, of course, for us as we monetize it. Our monetization is largely going to be through consulting and software, and I'll explain that. Infrastructure will benefit, but I will not call that a direct monetization route.\n\nSo, let me start with consulting. If you noticed, I talked about and Jim talked about what we have done with hybrid cloud, aka OpenShift, in consulting. When we began with this journey in 2019, our book of business was, to be precise and to round it out, zero. In the first year, we signed about $1 billion of business.\n\nAnd at this point, we have, inception to date, signed 9 billion, with an annual run rate of $2 billion in consulting. I would tell you and expect that we will play out AI in a similar way. I hesitate to call it anything else until we get six months or so down the road, in which case then we'll have more knowledge. Now, on the software side.\n\nWe are very, very excited by the initial reaction to the watsonx platform. The number of projects we have going on, the client interest, it really is something which we are very, very pleased by. So, what's a model to think of it on? As I think about how OpenShift, which was a Red Hat product that came in in 2019, it grew literally doubled each year for the first four years. And at this point, the revenue is about 10 times of what it was when it came in.\n\nAnd right now, we have quantified it at $1.1 billion on an annualized run rate basis. So, that gives you a sense of the excitement we have around these projects, these technologies, and what it could do for us as we begin to go forward. Now, third and most important, but I don't want to quantify it, is the fact that AI will infuse in models every single product we have, whether it's sustainability, whether it's our database products, whether it's our consulting projects, whether it's inside the mainframe with the Telum. But I'm not including those in those first two categories.\n\nSo, with that, let me give it to Jim for the TPS question.\n\nJim Kavanaugh -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Arvind, and thanks, Wamsi, for the question. We're obviously very pleased with our overall software performance here in the second quarter, accelerating to 8% at constant currency and was pretty pervasive, both acceleration in hybrid platform and solution and, to your question, transaction processing. But you get underneath the performance, double digit in Red Hat, double digit in data and AI, and double digit in our high-value transaction processing business overall, which, by the way, gives us the confidence exiting first half to raise our guidance in software overall to the high end of our mid-single-digit model. Now, to your question about transaction processing, you know, we constantly talk about on these calls the value of TP in our business model.\n\nIt's a value vector, 30% of software. It's a tremendous source of profit and cash that gives us financial flexibility to reinvest for growth overall. It also provides a tremendous incumbency position for IBM multiplier effect. You know, we entered the year, Arvind and I talked about we saw the inflection shift in TP in '23, and that was predicated on the successful mainframe programs that we've had over the last two.\n\nBy the way, the last program, we're up 2x, our installed MIPS capacity. So, we have a much more extended opportunity base to go get those strong renewal rates overall. But we said, from a model perspective, we saw the inflection shift. Versus being down mid-single digit, which was a tremendous drain on us, we saw low single-digit growth.\n\nNow, on top of that, just given the highly inflationary environment, we talked about we were going to get disproportional price in '23. Call that, I don't know, two, three, four points, somewhere in that ballpark. So, when you look at our first half performance, our first half, we're up 8%. By the way, our first half last year was relatively flat.\n\nIt's our easier compare. So, we have to acknowledge it's easier compare. We're going to enter a more difficult compare in the second half. But that eight points of growth overall, I would say, you know, once you normalize for the easier compare, we can grow low single digit on a sustainable basis.\n\nThis year, just given the differentiated price position, we said we'd grow mid-single digit. And we feel very confident exiting first half.\n\nPatricia Murphy -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Wamsi. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\n\nAmit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\nYup. Thanks for taking my question. You know, I guess I was hoping we'd spend a bit of time on the consulting side, and, you know, growth did decelerate there a little bit, from 8% in Q1 to 6%. I'd love to understand how did that 6% growth in consulting in Q2 stack up versus your internal expectations.\n\nAnd then given the deceleration starting June, maybe just talk about what gives you confidence that the growth rate holds up in that 6% to 8% range for the back half of the year when some of your peers have actually talked about that market decelerating a bit? Thank you.\n\nJim Kavanaugh -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Amit. I'll take this one. You know, we're actually pleased with our consulting performance. Remember, you dial back 90 days ago, and we saw a real change in buying behavior, particularly in the United States, around discretionary project-based activity that slowed down in the month of March.\n\nAnd that impacted our backlog realization in the quarter. But we actually posted relatively strong growth, 8% in the first quarter. We had midteens, if I remember correctly, signings growth. When we look at second quarter, we have not seen any substantive change in client buying behavior at all.\n\nSo, I think that's actually a positive indicator. We didn't see it permeate across other markets around the world. You know, clients like us. You know, internally, I'm focused every single day on getting productivity cost, quick payback, ROI, and our clients are looking at that.\n\nBut, you know, on top of that 6% growth here in the second quarter, I think it should be noted, we delivered very strong signings growth that was pervasive, both large deals, small deal. So, we see continued momentum where client demand is there, where there's a value to clients overall and how we've differentiated ourselves. And I would argue, we're gaining share. We grew 24% in signings in the second quarter.\n\nAnd that was driven by areas that you would quite expect around digital transformation, application modernization, data and technology. AI, by the way, grew 50% signings in the first quarter. So, to Arvind's opening volley about AI and how we're going to monetize, this is early green shoots on some of these things. So, we exited the quarter with about, you know, 1.1 book-to-bill.\n\nBy the way, that's the strongest book-to-bill we've had in quite some time. Now, that positions us well for the second half. We got very good strategic partnership velocity. We got very good Red Hat book of business, growing strong double digit.\n\nBut we're going to continue to monitor this client buying behavior on backlog realization. That's the critical piece. And by the way, our erosion, we have not seen any change or inflection shifts in erosion. So, we're positioned well for the second half, and that gave us confidence in our 6% to 8% maintaining guidance for the year.\n\nPatricia Murphy -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Amit. Sue, let's take the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next is Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may go ahead.\n\nToni Sacconaghi -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\n\nYes. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, when you talked about feeling comfortable with Q3 estimates, was that both a revenue and an EPS statement? And then my question is, on software, I think you were looking for 200-basis-point margin improvement for the year and now you're saying 150 to 200. Can you speak to that? And also, when we look at the improved software revenue growth, is that just improvement in transaction processing because you were way above your forecast in Apptio or is there something beyond that? And related to that, are you modeling any substantive revenue from AI and consulting or in software this year and why would that not impact your outlook if you were? Thank you.\n\nJim Kavanaugh -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nHey, Toni. Thank you. I'll take the first two or three or four of your questions, and then I think Arvind can talk about the AI piece overall. But when you look at our software margin overall, first of all, we're taking our full year guidance up on revenue to the high end of our model.\n\nSo, that's about a point raise year over year. And by the way, that's all in, as we stated in prepared remarks, including how we're very excited about the Apptio acquisition overall. But that raising guidance, I think, is a reflection of the pervasive performance we've seen in the first half that we feel pretty confident in. You know, we entered -- let's dial back.\n\nWe entered the year, we said mid-single digit. We were coming off a peak ELA. We said we get five to six points of growth out of annuity. And we would have about a one-point headwind on transactional.\n\nWe had a pretty solid first quarter, delivering above our model. We continued and accelerated that in second quarter. And by the way, it's both transaction processing, hybrid platform and solution overall. So, when you look at it, we see one, yeah, Apptio, very excited.\n\nIt's a high-growth company, high-recurring revenue, and a highly profitable company. And we expect it, just given normal customary regulations of closing, probably assumes sometime early fourth quarter. So, that's about a half a point in that raise. The remaining half a point is going to be solid mid-single-digit growth on TP, to my answer to Amit.\n\nAnd then third is we actually exited the first half with very solid transactional growth, albeit we do understand we're going to wrap in fourth quarter on a very strong ELA cycle. But the first half, we're seeing very strong clothing upsell that's in the mid-20% year over year on those expiring ELAs through the first half. So, I think it's all three pieces overall. I think I covered both the revenue piece.\n\nOn the margin, Toni, that is really just the dilution effect in the first quarter of Apptio. So, we called about 200 basis points for the year. Now, we're putting Apptio in. You know, we're somewhere between 150 basis points and 200 basis points.\n\nBut I'll remind you, we expect a very quick accretive business as we go forward, just given they're profitable overall. So, I'll turn it over to Arvind on the AI.\n\nArvind Krishna -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Thanks, Jim. So, Toni, I'll comment quickly on the color on revenue from AI, both in software and consulting. So, as I said, in consulting, we're expecting a number of projects to get signed.\n\nBy the way, as Jim mentioned, some of that is getting baked in, and you're seeing that in the strong signings that we have in consulting in the second quarter with the over 20% growth in signings. And a lot of that was, indeed, data and AI consulting projects. Ditto in software, I just note that we had double-digit growth in the data and AI subsegment of software. And no doubt that some of that is colored by clients doing more around AI with us than they have historically.\n\nSo, we expect to see it. But I do want us to be sort of all in, all in with 2023, including the AI color. We see software at the high end of our model, and we see consulting in the range that Jim just laid out. So, while we are very excited about it and we see a lot of traction on AI, it is included in the estimates that we just gave.\n\nPatricia Murphy -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Toni. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\n\nShannon Cross -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\n\nThank you very much. Arvind, I'm wondering, can you talk -- and I know you haven't launched it globally, but I'm sure everybody's having conversations right now. What is the interest level and understanding of AI by geography and how do you think that sort of plays out and rolls through? And then just as a follow-up to the commentary on Apptio, I wondered if you could talk a bit more about what was sort of the key drivers of that acquisition, what KPIs we should watch for. And then I'm also curious as to how the 450 billion of anonymized data that you're gaining with that, how do you think you'll leverage that within your foundational models? Thank you.\n\nArvind Krishna -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks. Shannon, great questions. So, when I look at AI by geography, at once at a simple level, I will tell you that over the last six months, the interest in AI spans across all markets, all industries. So, it is a international phenomenon, not confined to the U.S.\n\nNow, we've got to dig under it. Then if I look at the maturity of clients to actually have their enterprise ready to embrace AI to be able to interact with their clients, their employees, that does vary. I have to acknowledge it. The North American market is probably the most further ahead on this.\n\nI think Western Europe comes second, likely together with some of the more advanced and developed markets in South America. Following that then is Asia and all of what would we call the Global South. Japan has a strong interest, but they tend to be cautious on adopting technology, not necessarily in experimenting. In experimenting, they'll be pretty quick.\n\nAnd then it'll go into South Asia, where, always, I think technology adoption tends to lag by a year or two behind the West. So, that gives you some sense of that. But that said, every government, every enterprise, every CEO, every CIO that I talked to wants to talk about AI, what it can do to their company, what should it be in their country. And all of the questions around sovereignty of models and data and privacy and not depending only on a few international players comes into the conversation.\n\nAnd that's why we talk a lot about private models and models that can be left behind with a client because that is coming up more and more. And so, that, I hope, gives you some color on how this is going to play out. Coming to the next part of your question on Apptio. Look, the key drivers of this acquisition are pretty straightforward.\n\nWhen we look at and talk to CIOs, CFOs, CEOs, they're all getting worried about their spend across the hybrid landscape. What do I spend on my first public cloud? What is it on my second? What is it on a SaaS property? What am I spending on my own data centers? So, to give people a virtual cockpit that really lets them span across this, not just in terms of the third-party spend but also the people and the process spending is something they're all deeply, deeply interested in, and more than a few CEOs I've talked to said it really gives them a handle on what's going on and where the money is being spent. That, I think, is going to play in right away. And you went right to the second value prop.\n\nWith that spend data coming in across enterprises, the aggregate anonymized across the asset is the 450 billion, now helping people benchmark who does this better than you. Who does this process better? Who can do this with fewer total spend on a public or a private resource is interesting to people because benchmarks is a great way to guide oneself to better performance. We expect that over time, we'll be able to monetize that into -- if -- into a large language or a foundation model and be able to give people even better predictors of where they can take their spend to. That's why we're so excited about it.\n\nAnd I think the last part of your question was KPIs. Look, as we look to get Apptio much more international, while our footprint is, I'll call it, maybe two-thirds, one-third outside the U.S. and in the U.S., they're almost the inverse. So, as we can put it into our distribution channel, that'll be one big expansion as we go over the next year or so.\n\nThe second one is we believe we have a great chance to also increase the penetration in our larger clients. So, those are two big metrics, while we continue the success in the growth rate they've had using their own channels.\n\nPatricia Murphy -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Shannon. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next is Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\n\nErik Woodring -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nGood afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Arvind, I'd love to dig into how you guys are thinking about M&A today. Obviously, you announced the Apptio deal a few weeks ago.\n\nThat largely probably takes transformational M&A off the table. But you obviously still have some additional dry powder to make other acquisitions. So, you know, maybe if you could talk about what your appetite is for further M&A. Are you thinking about any other end markets or solutions you'd target now? Is valuation becoming more restrictive for you? You know, maybe said differently, just what's your message on M&A today post-Apptio? Thanks so much.\n\nArvind Krishna -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nErik, so I might sound somewhat repetitive to those of you who have heard me over the past two years on this topic. So, if I just sort of maybe just step back and say taking unusual actions off the table for a moment. We had talked about a total fin flex, let's call it, circa 20 billion over a three-year period. That includes the ability to raise additional debt if we so desired.\n\nWe've been spending circa about 3 billion a year for the last couple. So, that tells you the capability and the flexibility that we have. You asked about valuations, and I hope my answer to that tells you that we are always on the lookout, and I'll get to which categories because you asked that also. On valuations, I wouldn't call it so much that today's is restrictive.\n\nWhat I could say is that while some of -- at least the reports I was reading were talking about valuations perhaps coming down in multiples over this year, it doesn't seem that that's the case. They've not gone up in a -- in any kind of tremendous way, but they have not come down. But the market is what the market is. So, we find properties that meet our criteria, and my criteria are pretty straightforward.\n\nDoes it align with our strategy? And I'll call those areas out in a moment. Does it actually give us synergy? Meaning, can we, the combined entity, grow faster than the individuals could before, right? Just to put it in very financial terms. And if it is larger, it has to be accretive. And by larger, I mean it's not a tuck-in, meaning it's not a few hundred million, it's larger than that.\n\nThen it's got to get accretive, let's say, within two years at the latest. So, if it meets those criteria, it's certainly an attractive proposition. The areas we are in, we don't want to open up more strategic lane so to speak. Our areas are hybrid cloud, data and AI, automation, cyber, and those consulting properties, which, in turn, help these.\n\nSo, that's kind of the lanes we are in. And if I look at the latest one, Apptio, I'd say it kind of hits three out of my four. It hits hybrid cloud because it helps you deploy those. It is a big data and AI property because that's what they use.\n\nAnd it is automation because it takes out human labor costs from any of those processes. So, it was actually a very, very good fit. And, you know, if any of you have suggestions for similar things, we are all ears and you can certainly write to me.\n\nPatricia Murphy -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nHey, thanks, Erik. Let's go to the next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next is David Grossman with Stifel. You may go ahead.\n\nDavid Grossman -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\n\nThank you. You know, Arvind, you spoke extensively about the favorable impact of pricing on the transaction processing portfolio. What have you learned from repricing that portfolio and what other segments of your business could potentially benefit from similar actions? And sorry to violate the one-question rule, but, Jim, I just want a clarification. My recollection is that you had about $500 million of working capital tailwind factored into the free cash flow guide.\n\nI just want to make sure I got that right and that's the same. Thanks.\n\nArvind Krishna -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo, David, let me address the first part of your question on pricing. Look, I'd like to be careful. TP certainly benefited this year, but the biggest part of the benefit has been the mainframe cycle and the capacity and value that our clients see. Yes.\n\nWas there a price increase? Given the labor inflation of 2022 and some ongoing in '23, given the strong dollar, effectively, there was pricing increase because of those factors, and that got taken well by the market because of the value they see on that. Would I expect to see similar pricing on TP? And then I'll come to other parts of both consulting and software. I doubt, David, that it will be on the same range because, definitely, I think we would all agree, '22 had a high inflation, and because our costs go together with the labor and the dollar, I don't think it will be as strong as that. But I would expect maybe moderate increases based on just the pricing in TP.\n\nNow, consulting is also got both labor and inflation built in. And when we are seeing 6%, 8%, 10% increases in labor costs, it is I think appropriate to be able to pass some of that on, albeit with a lag. And you heard Jim talk in his prepared remarks about that. That is some of what is coming through in consulting.\n\nIf there remains underlying labor inflation, I fully expect to be able to pass that on, again with a bit of a lag, to clients in consulting because, otherwise, that's not a healthy business to go around. I think on the rest of software, except TP, I would expect that as labor inflation is there, those elements do come in effectively on pricing, renewal rates, and so on. But I'll also say it's a competitive market, and you have to remain competitively priced to where the others are. So, I would say it's in those two, TP, consulting, and then in other elements of the portfolio that pricing can play a role.\n\nBy the way, our renewal rates are a very strong indication that these are portfolios that provide tremendous value to our clients. But we remain competitive on price.\n\nJim Kavanaugh -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I mean, our strategy overall has always been around pricing for value, right? But, David, just to put it in perspective, you know, last year, we all dealt with a very -- and we're still dealing with a very highly inflationary environment that was somewhere anywhere what, three, four, or five points above history overall. That's kind of what we've been talking about as the disproportional pricing in '23. You're not going to get that every single year, to Arvind's point.\n\nBut, you know, I've always said, pricing optimization is a direct correlation to the value and differentiation you offer to clients. You got to bring value to clients or they're not going to accept the pricing. And we've been seeing good take-up with our mission-critical transaction processing. Arvind talked about the human capital-based business, the consulting, etc.\n\nBut just quickly to wrap on your second question, David, we said entering the year -- remember, we came off of December where we had a shortfall leaving much more on the balance sheet than collected in working capital. Working capital for the year is probably somewhere around 400 million to 500 million, like you said. And that's a tailwind coming off of last year. The remaining piece of the 1.2 billion of free cash flow growth year over year is the fundamental improvement in the operating discipline of our revenue and operating margin and cash from profit.\n\nPatricia Murphy -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nHey, thanks, David. Let's see if we can squeeze two more in. Let's go to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is from Keith Bachman with BMO. You may go ahead.\n\nKeith Bachman -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nHi. Many thanks for the question. Arvind, I wanted to direct this to you if I could. You've talked about the success you've had, even at these early stages of signing new AI offerings in the consulting side of the business.\n\nHow are you thinking about the supply side of the business? And what I mean by that is as you look out over time, the software development process, as you talked about down in Orlando, is going to become much more efficient. And so, if your consulting business is really a seat-based model that drives revenue and if those developers are increasing productivity by, I don't know, 30%, 40% because of gen AI, presumably, clients will want that back. So, how do you think about the disinflationary forces associated with gen AI on the delivery side of the model, which is, I think, separate and distinct from the opportunities associated with new demand sources? And, Jim, if I can just sneak one in to you, too. If you could talk about the total MIPS growth, not just the cycle growth, but the total MIPS growth that you've recently experienced and as you look out over the next couple of years.\n\nJust trying to understand what the pricing increase -- you know, how that may -- how you may be able to use pricing on TP to leverage that MIPS shift? That's it for me. Many thanks.\n\nArvind Krishna -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo, Keith, let me address the first part of your question. So, if I look at it in the shot -- let's just walk through what do the consulting team actually do. They spend a lot of time upfront with the business side, going through business processes, worrying about how to optimize business processes, cutting across silos, coming up with data architectures which could help the business, helping the business decide how they're going to roll forward. All of that, to be candid, holds even in a world of gen AI, assuming it gets to perfection.\n\nNow, let's get to the next level. A lot of what our teams do, and it is perhaps unique to us, we tend to work on much more mission-critical systems. We tend to work much more on things which are fundamental to the business around financials, supply chain, cyber resilience, and so on. Will gen AI and large language models have an impact? Absolutely.\n\nI will tell you that if I look over a five- to 10-year horizon, I would agree with you that for that second part of consulting, not the first, I would agree and expect to see a 30% productivity. Now, I will tell you that in that time frame, I would believe that for IBM, that's an advantage, not a disadvantage. Why? Absolutely, it's disinflationary. But if we share that with the client, that means we can win more work.\n\nAnd the total labor pool we need to drive an amount of revenue is lower because there is obviously value in the technology that we are using, be it for test automation or code writing. And maybe I can be a little bit boastful, I'll use that word, Keith, and talk about one example that we have. So, we wrote a code assistant for Ansible, and it is part of our watsonx family. That code assistant for Ansible can help our Ansible developers, which is used as a -- I think it's the most widely adopted language for IT deployment, get up to 60% more productive.\n\nNow, that's one piece of it. IT deployment overall, I would then say, gets probably somewhere between 10% and 30% overall productivity. So, that's why I think that 30% number is a good one to keep in mind. But to go across all the environments, COBOL, Java, Python, AI models, that's going to take a few years before our clients get the full confidence around that topic.\n\nJim Kavanaugh -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. Keith, thanks for the question. On mainframe overall, you know, pretty pleased given where we're at, GA plus four quarters in. So, we wrapped on last year.\n\nRemember, we talked a lot last year, we came out with -- unlike the prior programs, we came out with a second quarter launch in a highly seasonal transactional quarter, and we grew 77% last year overall. And we wrapped on that this year. I think we printed down 30% here in the second quarter. But on a two-year CAGR, so far, five quarters in, you know, it's the most successful program in the mainframe that we've had.\n\nNow, why is it important? Yes, definitely, the value we deliver to clients, whether it's embedded AI at scale, cyber resilience security, cloud-native development. But it's important internally to us because it's a platform that drives a multiplier effect, to your question, around transaction processing. And we've been talking about this 2x installed MIPS shift -- MIPS capacity over the last program. That was actually, you know, the z15 program over z14, you know, because we're only five quarters in the z16.\n\nBut if you fast forward right now into z16, five quarters in, we're, you know, 120% to 130% up on a installed MIPS capacity already. And you know the tail of that usually happens in the outer half of the next three or four quarters before we come out with the new one. So, we feel pretty good, and that's why we had the confidence entering this year, Arvind and I, to take up the transaction processing model to actually low single-digit growth from being down mid-single. So, we see that continuing.\n\nThanks for your question.\n\nPatricia Murphy -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nOK. We're at the top of the hour, but let's squeeze in one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead.\n\nBen Reitzes -- Melius Research -- Analyst\n\nHey. Thanks a lot. Thanks for sneaking me in there. I wanted to ask you, Arvind, you know, in layman's terms with regard to AI, I find a lot of investors want to understand IBM's place better.\n\nAnd in terms of AI, where you have your consulting and then hand it off to software, are you finding that IBM is well-positioned to help people pick the right models to train, to lower their costs? What is it about IBM with the consulting and software that has your unique place, you know, set for growth and some of the optimism that you sound like you have heading into next year?\n\nArvind Krishna -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nBen, thank you for the question, and I deeply appreciate your asking it in that form. Look, when we look at -- let me start with our extreme advantage. When clients have data that they'd like to train models on and they absolutely want to preserve the intellectual property in that data, they do not want the learnings. I mean, I can go to three forms.\n\nAlmost everyone will say, look, we're not going to take your data and give it to anybody in direct form. OK. Next, how about learnings in the model itself from the data? Do you use that implicitly or explicitly or not at all? Three, the very fact that you're asking a certain kind of question can, in turn, reveal information, I'll use the word from my college training of side channel information. I'm sure that all of you also understand what that word could imply.\n\nSo, for people who are worried about all that, which we estimate to be at least 30% of the overall AI opportunity. Think about a bank dealing with regulatory compliance. Think about a pharma company dealing with reports to the FDA. Think about a healthcare company worried about some kind of side effect on something.\n\nThink about a chemicals company worrying about their proprietary formulations, not just what's in the literature. So, as you go through all of these, there are lots and lots of examples where people want to train models. Maybe it's a refinement of a larger known model, so to your point on other models, and I'll come to that. So, we find that there's a lot of opportunity, and those are the questions that people are asking us.\n\nThen next, a number of people are -- currently, they have great models. They're great for big public consumption. They're great because everybody kind of has the same need for productivity. But there is also a world right now from the partners we work with, there's already over 100,000 open-source models, in addition to the models that we, IBM, provide.\n\nHow do you pick from those models? Which one is appropriate? And we are taking a conscious strategy that we are not going to constrain the model that our clients want. So, on our consulting teams, we will work with all the models, our own open source and others' models, so we can help our clients decide on which is the best one for them. Look, 30 years of being here has shown us that trying to help the clients navigate through the extreme complexity of this world is helpful to us, and we can become much better advisors and gain revenue in the process. So, hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we are going to win here and get our fair share of this market.\n\nSo, given that we're just past the top of the hour, let we wrap up the call. We are in a really good position as we enter the second half of the year. Solutions meet today's client needs, new innovation we are bringing to market, and there is momentum and productivity in our underlying operations. As always, we need to execute to capture the opportunity in front of us, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year.\n\nPatricia Murphy -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Sue.

We will now begin with remarks from Wahid Nawabi. Wahid.\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Jonah. Welcome, everyone, to our fiscal year 2023 fourth quarter earnings conference call. I will start by summarizing our performance and recent achievements. After which, Kevin will review our financial results in greater detail.\n\nI will then provide information related to our expectations for fiscal year 2024. After which, Kevin, Jonah, and I will take your questions. I'm pleased to report that the fourth quarter results exceeded most of our expectations, and we set records across many key financial metrics. Our key messages, which are included on Slide Number 3 of our earnings presentation, are as follows.\n\nFourth quarter revenue rose to $186 million, a 40% increase compared to fiscal year 2022 fourth quarter, while product revenue nearly doubled year over year to just under $142 million. Second, for the full year, revenue increased to $541 million, versus $446 million last year, representing 21% growth. This makes it six consecutive years of top-line growth. Third, our funded backlog also doubled from fiscal year 2022 to set another record at $424 million.\n\nThis backlog was driven by more than $750 million in bookings throughout fiscal year 2023, reflecting strong demand for our solutions, led by our small UAS or SUAS and tactical missile systems or TMS businesses. And fourth, given recent performance trends and our visibility into coming quarters, we're providing fiscal year 2024 guidance that reflects nearly 20% growth in revenue, higher margins, and improved bottom-line results. The fundamentals of our business are strong, and we're well-positioned for significant expansion and value creation in fiscal year 2024 and beyond. The improvement in fourth quarter revenue was primarily due to higher SUAS and TMS sales, up 60% and more than 100%, respectively, compared to the prior-year period.\n\nThese results reflect ongoing demand for our Switchblade and Puma products. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was $68.4 million, an increase of 41% versus last fiscal year's $48.6 million. Our gross margin as a percentage of sales was approximately 37% in both periods. As previously discussed, we expect gross margins to remain strong in fiscal year 2024 as our revenue mix continues to shift to more favorable product sales.\n\nAs Kevin will cover in a moment, our pro forma bottom-line profitability metrics were also much stronger this quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by higher revenues, which more than offset increased operating expenses. This quarter caps a record year for AeroVironment. By carefully managing through challenges of the past few years such as supply chain constraints, labor shortages, and inflationary pressures, we have accelerated our growth and success.\n\nGiven our current backlog and robust demand for the company's broad portfolio of innovative unmanned solutions, we stand at the inflection point of a new phase of growth. I want to thank our investors for their continued support, especially as we enter this new chapter. As always, we're committed to delivering value to our shareholders and visibility into our progress. Finally, we're deeply honored and extremely proud of the growing level of assistance we have provided to our country and allies, including Ukraine.\n\nBefore we discuss each segment, I want to address the recent news that AeroVironment was not selected by the U.S. Army to proceed further with Increment 2 of the Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems, otherwise known as FTUAS. While we're disappointed, we have fully assessed the U.S. Army's evaluation process and submitted a request for further clarification.\n\nWe remain confident that the JUMP 20 UAS is the most versatile and cost-effective solution in the Group 2/3 UAS market today and will continue to focus on meeting the current needs of our customers. We're humbled and honored to support the Ukraine defense efforts as the only Group 2/3 UAS solution named in the recent U.S. aid package. The FTUAS increments we had been awarded to date did not comprise significant revenue for AeroVironment.\n\nWe recorded a noncash charge of $190.2 million in the fourth quarter related to the MUAS business, and Kevin will discuss its details further shortly. Importantly, the Army's decision will not have a material impact on near-term revenue growth. As we look ahead, we will focus on areas where we can improve to ensure we meet our customers' needs. Further, we remain focused on winning other key programs by continuing to leverage the strength of our robust portfolio of innovative unmanned solutions.\n\nDespite our exit from FTUAS Increment 2, we remain bullish on our medium UAS, or MUAS, product line. The JUMP 20 stands apart in its ability to perform in contested environments, with an unmatched capacity to carry our own payloads, and we believe it's the best Group 2/3 solution on the market today. There are multiple domestic and international opportunities which we are currently pursuing that present significant growth potential in the coming years. Now, shifting gears to other product lines.\n\nOur SUAS business delivered a record year of performance on the back of our largest-ever foreign military sales award in support of Ukraine. We're proud that our Puma systems have, again and again, proven themselves on the battlefield and are providing scouting and support for all U.S.-supplied artillery weapon systems deployed in Ukraine. We expect SUAS revenue to remain strong in fiscal year 2024. We have also launched several new products and additional enhancements to our SUAS portfolio and expect sales of these solutions to be a meaningful component of future revenues.\n\nOur TMS business product line represents a significant growth opportunity for the company. Total TMS revenue for the quarter more than doubled year over year, but this is only the start. The conflict in Ukraine and our Switchblade success on the battlefield has accelerated the global trend toward increased adoption of loitering munitions. We now have orders from four allied nations.\n\nMore importantly, the U.S. government has recently approved us to market and sell Switchblades to nearly 50 allied countries, up from 20 countries last year. Given the current level of global interest, record backlog, and growing demand in Switchblade, we expect our TMS business to be a leading growth driver for the company moving forward. Our unmanned ground vehicles, or UGV, product line achieved record levels of performance in the fourth quarter.\n\nSimilar to our TMS segment, UGV revenue more than doubled year over year, resulting in the unit's best year since its inception. We're also marking solid progress providing telemax and tEODor ground vehicles to Ukraine under an accelerated schedule, and these vehicles are performing well on the battlefield. We expect another growth year for this business in fiscal year 2024. Our HAPS product line continues to make solid progress in the development of next-generation Sunglider, the successfully commercialized stratospheric-based telecommunications services, and partnership with SoftBank.\n\nWe also recently received our first contract from the U.S. DOD for this unique capability and are actively pursuing multiple other defense opportunities. Given the current conflicts around the world, we believe that the defense market for HAPS represents a multibillion-dollar long-term growth opportunity, and we're well-positioned to supply this large market with our highly differentiated solar HAPS solution. And finally, our MacCready Works Advanced Solutions continues to establish AeroVironment as a leading global supplier of AI, machine learning, and autonomy-powered unmanned systems.\n\nWith the support of this team, AV is designing systems that will anticipate and evolve with the needs of our military. These include expandable autonomous capabilities that allow our UAS to continue operations without persistent radio link and advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms that can sense, analyze, and navigate the battlespace. We have deployed some of these capabilities within our product lines already and expect more in the future. This segment also continues to pursue new and exciting lines of business such as space robotics and contested logistics that could become new business segments of their own for AeroVironment.\n\nMacCready Works grew significantly in fiscal year 2023, and we expect to see additional top-line growth in fiscal year 2024. Before turning the call over to Kevin, I would like to note that starting in Q1 of this fiscal year, AeroVironment will define our segments differently to reflect the larger broader nature of our products and services and their associated end markets. Going forward, we will provide color on three segments. Combining our SUAS, MUAS, and UGV product lines -- will be combined into a new unmanned system segment.\n\nOur tactical missile systems will now become loitering munition systems. And our MacCready Works segment will include the current MacCready Works operations, along with HAPS and other customer-funded R&D programs. We look forward to sharing more on this new segmentation next quarter. With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin McDonnell for a review of the fourth quarter financials.\n\nKevin.\n\nKevin McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Wahid. Today, I'll be reviewing the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023 performance. During which, I will occasionally refer to our press release and earnings presentation available on our website. We ended the year extremely strong in terms of bookings, backlog, revenue, adjusted gross margins, and adjusted EBITDA.\n\nWahid will go over the guidance for FY '24 next, but we are set up for strong revenue and EBITDA growth in FY '24. However, as Wahid mentioned, we recorded a noncash charge in the fourth quarter related to our medium UAS business. I will cover these shortly. Let me begin by providing some more detail on the quarter -- revenue on the quarter.\n\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was at a new record level of $186 million, an increase of 40% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Slide 5 of the earnings presentation provides a breakdown of revenue by segment for the quarter. Our largest segment during the quarter was small UAS with a record $94.6 million of revenue, up from last year's $59.2 million. We saw a healthy mix of business within small UAS, with Ukraine shipments just over 40% and the remainder from new customers and upgrades to existing customers.\n\nIn other words, we are seeing strong demand beyond just Ukraine. Tactical missile systems, or TMS, recorded revenue of 42.5 million, compared to 20.2 million last year during Q4. It is also worth noting that we received $125 million of orders for our TMS products in Q4, bringing the total for the year to just over 230 million, showing the strength of domestic and global demand for the Switchblade products. Revenue for the -- from the other segment, which includes UGV, HAPS, the MacCready Works businesses, increased year over year to 40.6 million, versus 30.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\n\nOur medium UAS segment finished with revenue for the quarter of 8.3 million, a 33% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year '22. The reduction of revenue was a result of the lower COCO service revenue. For the year, revenues hit a record $540.5 million, which is 21% higher than fiscal 2022. We also had record bookings for the year at over $750 million.\n\nThis mostly organic revenue growth reflects the strong global demand for our products. Turning to gross margins. In Slide 5 of the earnings presentation, we showed a breakdown between product and service revenue. Specifically during the fourth quarter, product revenues accounted for 76% of total revenues, an increase from 56% in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.\n\nThe product mix shift was expected due to the substantial increase in sales of small UAS and TMS products. Slide 6 of the earnings presentation shows the trend of adjusted product and service gross margins, while Slide 12 reconciles the GAAP gross margins to the adjusted gross margins, which excludes intangible amortization expense and other noncash purchase accounting items. In the fourth quarter, GAAP gross margins remained steady at 37%, identical to the fourth quarter of the previous year. On the other hand, the non-GAAP adjusted gross margin slightly decreased to 39% from 40% in the prior year.\n\nAdjusted gross product margins for the quarter were 47%, versus 49% in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. The year-over-year decline in adjusted product gross margin can be attributed to the higher mix of TMS revenue. In terms of adjusted service gross margins, the fourth quarter was at 13%, versus 28% during the same quarter last year, primarily due to the accelerated depreciation charges related to our COCO service assets of 4.4 million. For the full year, GAAP gross margins ended at 32% in fiscal 2023, the same level as last fiscal year, and adjusted gross margins decreased from -- to 35% from 36%.\n\nThe decrease in adjusted gross margins was primarily due to the $14.5 million of accelerated depreciation from our medium UAS COCO assets. We expected -- we expect adjusted gross margins to improve to the high 30s in FY '24, with a shift to more product revenues and transition of service margins to a more normal level. In terms of adjusted EBITDA, Slide 13 of our earnings presentation shows the reconciliation of the GAAP net loss to adjusted EBITDA. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, adjusted EBITDA was $46 million, representing an increase of over 60 [Audio gap] The main factor contributing to this increase was higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by increased SG&A expenses and investments in R&D.\n\nFor the full fiscal year 2023, adjusted EBITDA was $90 million, representing an increase of 43% from last year. SG&A expense, including -- excluding intangible amortization and acquisition-related expenses, for the fourth quarter was 13% of revenue and 15% of revenue for the fiscal year 2023, compared to full fiscal year 2022 of 16% of revenue. R&D expense for the fourth quarter was 9% of revenue and 12% for full fiscal year 2023. We will continue to run R&D in the 10% to 12% range as we invest in new products and upgrades to existing products to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\n\nNow, turning to GAAP earnings. During the fourth quarter, the company encountered a net loss of 160.5 million, of which $190.1 million was a result of noncash charges related to the medium UAS business. Of the total noncash charge, 34.1 million was the acceleration of intangible asset amortization related to a particular customer. This accelerated amortization was recorded as SG&A expense in the quarter.\n\nThe remaining 156 million of the total noncash charge was a goodwill adjustment from the revaluation of the medium UAS goodwill from the Arcturus acquisition as a result of recasting of the future cash flows as a result of the FTUAS Increment 2 loss. Although we remain optimistic about the medium UAS business in both the short and long term, current business conditions dictate these adjustments. Slide 10 shows the reconciliation of GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP diluted EPS. GAAP EPS loss was $6.31 per share in the quarter and a loss of $7.04 per share in -- for the year, both reflecting the noncash charges discussed previously.\n\nIn terms of non-GAAP EPS, the company posted adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.99 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, versus $0.12 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Full year adjusted EPS was $1.26 per share, versus $1.06 per share in fiscal 2022. Turning to our balance sheet. Total cash, restricted cash, and investments at the end of the quarter was 156.5 million, which is an increase of 51.9 million from the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nIn addition, we reduced our debt by over $50 million during fiscal 2023. We did see an increase in working capital during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by increased accounts receivable related to the higher sales volume. As indicated in prior quarters, we expect to see continued increases in inventories and other working capital to support a higher level of business and minimize exposure to the supply chain issues and long lead times. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with over $150 million of cash, restricted cash, and investments and $100 million working capital facility, with no outstanding balance.\n\nNow, I'd like to turn things back to Wahid.\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Kevin. The macro environment continues to support greater adoption of unmanned solutions. The Ukraine conflict has accelerated existing trends toward greater adoption of distributed solutions such as small drones and loitering munitions by demonstrating their effectiveness against well-equipped adversaries. These solutions are highly impactful, but typically far less expensive, have shorter lead times, and enable an agile force structure compared with larger traditional manned systems.\n\nFurther, these solutions enable countries with smaller defense budgets to secure effective defensive capabilities and provide a deterrent to adversaries. We believe these global trends, combined with our market-leading technology-driven unmanned solutions, will support our growth in fiscal year 2024 and for years to come. I'm now pleased to provide our guidance for fiscal year 2024, shown on Slide Number 7, as follows. We anticipate revenue of between $630 million and $660 million.\n\nWe forecast net income between $50 million to $58 million or $1.91 to $2.21 per diluted share; non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of between $110 million and $120 million; and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, excluding acquisition-related costs, amortization of intangible assets, and other one-time expenses, of between $2.30 and $2.60. We expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA of between 16% and 18% of revenue for the full fiscal year, while R&D investment is anticipated to remain between 10% to 12% of revenue. Our funded backlog at the end of fiscal year 2023 was a record $424 million. As a result, visibility to the midpoint of our fiscal year '24 revenue guidance range is at 78%.\n\nThis visibility sets us up for a strong fiscal year 2024. We expect first half revenue to represent almost 50% of the full fiscal year. Further, Q1 revenue should account for nearly 40% of first half revenues. Before turning the call over for questions, let me once again summarize the key points from today's call.\n\nFirst, we delivered record fourth quarter performance and met or exceeded our expectations. Second, full year revenue was also a record, marking our sixth consecutive year of top-line growth. Third, our funded backlog is at record levels, reflecting strong global demand for our solutions. And fourth, the fundamentals of our business are as strong as they've ever been, and we expect fiscal year 2024 to be yet another record-setting year for the company.\n\nI'm also excited to inform you that Admiral Phil Davidson recently joined our board of directors. Admiral Davidson's outstanding qualifications and credentials speak for themselves. His guidance, informed by his extensive and relevant military expertise, will be key in enabling us to better support our customers while capitalizing on the significant opportunities in front of us. I would like to thank our talented team for their dedication and hard work and helping our customers achieve their vital missions.\n\nBased on their perseverance, the faith entrusted in us by our customers, and the ongoing support of our investors, we believe we're in the best shape ever for a record-setting fiscal year 2024. We remain committed to delivering superior returns for our investors. And with that, Kevin, Jonah, and I will now take your questions.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\n\nKen Herbert -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Hey. Good afternoon, Wahid and Kevin, and Jonah.\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood afternoon, Ken.\n\nKevin McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nHi, Ken.\n\nKen Herbert -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nHey. Nice end of the fiscal year, Wahid. I wondered if you could provide a little more granularity on the revenue guidance for fiscal '24. And specifically, can you comment on the implied assumptions for growth within sort of the current TMS and SUAS segments?\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Ken. Of course. Our team did a fantastic job. We're proud of the achievements, especially given the challenges that we've had in the last quarter.\n\nRecord year in terms of backlog revenue. All across the board, pretty much very strong results for fiscal '23. And more importantly, as you mentioned, it sets us up really, really well for fiscal year '24 with, again, another record funded backlog and 78% visibility toward the midpoint of our guidance. In terms of growth, we expect both TMS and unmanned systems or SUAS product lines to have significant growth in the coming year.\n\nThe demand for our systems and our products are pretty broad across the board and not just in the United States, but also internationally. So, it's a pretty diversified set of customers, opportunities, and product portfolio that's driving and fueling our growth. We obviously expect to grow very significantly next year, close to almost $100 million on top of a very strong growth year. And the other thing that's really important also to note is that the strong backlog and visibility is allowing us to level load the quarters, which allows us to have a roughly evenly first half, second half, maybe first half is slightly lower than 50% but close to it, and then the first quarter being almost 40% of the first half's revenue.\n\nSo, all those things is a result of really strong demand for our products across the market and a change in the paradigm. I see an inflection point here in the market where small unmanned systems, as well as loitering munitions, is really changing the way that military think about getting prepared to defend themselves and fight wars in the future.\n\nKen Herbert -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Thanks, Wahid. And I think you mentioned that you're -- you've got an approval now to sell the Switchblade into, I think, 50 countries. Can you just comment on actually how many countries you've been selling the system into and what -- what's the runway as you think about sort of capturing or obviously getting sales eventually into all 50 of those countries?\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSure. So, Ken, as I mentioned, we have orders so far that we have booked from four allied countries to date. However, the list, you're right, has grown. The list of countries that the U.S.\n\nDOD and the State Department have given us an approval to market and eventually sell to basically more than doubled, from 20 before last year to close to 50 countries now. We're actively involved. So, that's, by itself, is a very large increase. And it shows, A, that there are lots of countries that are in need of this and they would like to have this capability; and B, our track record and performance in Ukraine and with the U.S.\n\nmilitary has demonstrated the capability and the value of this system. And so, U.S. DOD has been very encouraging and positive and supporting us to increase that list of 50 countries. In terms of how many countries do I think it's going to happen, I think this is going to follow a very similar trend, although it might be a little bit faster as our small UAS has gone through over the last decade.\n\nOver the last decade, if you recall, our small UAS has grown from very small number of countries to well over 50 countries now. And I think that the TMS business, or loitering munitions that we're going to call it in the future, has a similar potential. We're actively engaged with several countries, several countries across the world, both Europe and Asia. And many of them have interest in acquiring and getting this capability.\n\nSo, I think over the next year or two, we're going to continue to increase the number of countries, and this business is set up for very healthy growth in the years to come.\n\nKen Herbert -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks, Wahid. I'll pass it back there.\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYou're welcome, Ken.\n\nKevin McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Ken.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. You may proceed.\n\nLouie DiPalma -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst\n\nWahid, Kevin, and Jonah, good afternoon.\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nHi, Louie.\n\nKevin McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nHi there, Louie.\n\nLouie DiPalma -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst\n\nWahid, at your Analyst Day, you discussed how you are working on the development of several new products, including a vertical takeoff and landing Puma, a VAPOR helicopter capable of carrying a small munitions payload, and also the Jackal turbojet air-launched loitering munition. Can you provide an update on the development of some of these new products?\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSure, Louie. That is very much accurate, what you just mentioned. We have introduced several new products on our last Analyst Day, and we are here to -- pleased to report that we've actually started to ship some of those products to our customers and received orders for them as well. And so, as I mentioned in my remarks, a decent portion of our future SUAS product line revenue will be based on these new enhancements and new products that we're launching for the market.\n\nObviously, it's going to take some time for that to ramp up because of the customers' acquisition cycle and time frames. But the -- so far, the feedback from our customers has been very strong. The products, also, are category industry best in terms of their performance. So, VAPOR MX 55 that we just launched, it is a helicopter, electrically powered.\n\nThat is -- we have even demonstrated its capability to launch Switchblades off of it. So, that, by itself, is a pretty critical capability that is, so far, to my knowledge, is not really matched in that size and shape and form. The Jackal, of course, is a product that we're partnering with Northrop Grumman for a specific opportunity with the U.S. Army, a program, a record name called Long Range Precision Munition, LRPM.\n\nAnd obviously, we're making solid progress. That is in the years to come. It's not immediate. And it is a large program that we're going after that.\n\nAnd that's obviously a version of Switchblade, as roughly the size of the Switchblade 600 that is more of a sprint loiter. So, it actually travels on high speeds. And then when it gets to the destination or target, it slows down, which gives it a significant other set of capabilities and advantages in the battlefield. And obviously, the Puma VTOL allows us to launch Pumas without a runway and without hand-launching them.\n\nSo, these products, among many others, is where we've been investing in the years ahead and will continue to invest because we see the need for these systems and our customers' demand for them going up, not down. And we're in a great position to capitalize on that, especially given a very large installed base of customers. So, I also want to mention that another area that we've been investing over the last several years that I mentioned on my remarks is our AI autonomy and software analytics, allowing these systems to work in GPS-denied operations, without communications at all, and being able to find targets and do automatic target recognition and, in fact, work cohesively as a team where a Puma can identify a target, pass on that information to a Switchblade operator, automatically work for the Switchblade to be launched. So, these capabilities is really, to some extent, unique and give us an advantage against our competitors because we have the largest family of system solutions that is integrated and interoperable and intelligent as a whole.\n\nSo, that's really where our investments have been going, and we look forward to reporting more progress in those areas in the quarters to come.\n\nLouie DiPalma -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst\n\nThanks, Wahid. And, Kevin, you mentioned that, I think, there were $230 million worth of TMS orders for fiscal 2023. Are you able to share roughly how much of that was related to the Switchblade 600 as there's obviously a lot of investor excitement over the 600, and investors are looking for data points in terms of how that product is progressing? Thanks.\n\nKevin McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks for the question, Louie, but we don't really break out the orders or backlog by the particular products. I think both products have different markets, and we hope they both sell really, really well.\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. And we have had very strong success so far with our -- both all three models of our Switchblade variants: Switchblade 300, Switchblade 600, Louie, as well as the Blackwing. As you know, it's a fairly well-received product within the U.S. submarine community.\n\nBut Switchblade 600, you know, we feel very good about it. The market for that is very large. We have shipped that product to our customers, and they're quite happy with it, and we continue to increase capacity and production to meet the growing needs of our customers.\n\nLouie DiPalma -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst\n\nSounds good. Thanks, Wahid, and thanks, Kevin.\n\nKevin McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you.\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Louie.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Greg Konrad with Jefferies. You may proceed.\n\nGreg Konrad -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n\nGood evening and nice quarter.\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Greg.\n\nKevin McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Greg.\n\nGreg Konrad -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n\nMaybe just to start on, on TMS, you called out revenue doubling in the quarter and only being the start. How are you thinking about supply chain into fiscal year '24 and how is that balance with demand and the ability to ramp? And given the commentary around international, does that have any impact on profit mix within the segment going forward as those international awards do ramp?\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo, Greg, yes, we're very pleased with the progress we've been making on TMS. As I said, I consider this to be also an inflection point for loitering munitions in general. Our loitering munitions product line is the most battle-proven product in the market. There's nothing out there that can match its track record and success in battle-proven sort of performance so far, number one.\n\nNumber two, we do expect significant growth in fiscal year '24 on TMS, even though we had a very strong year last year, and our backlog is very, very strong for TMS. But that's just the beginning in my view. I think over the next several years, the TMS business is going to continue to grow. Really, we're in an inflection point in this market.\n\nWe've got a lot of customer indicators and engagements that tells us that their demand for this could be very large. It's a multibillion-dollar market, in my view, worldwide. And it's going to continue to grow. And we haven't even addressed the market so far or penetrated the market for air-launched effects, the capability of Switchblade to come off of such as, you know, helicopters -- next-generation helicopters, next-generation fighter jets, as well as from ground vehicles such as the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle.\n\nIn terms of the lead times, that continues to be a slight challenge. The lead times for some of our products is -- for the supply chain is a little long, and we're -- we constantly are working on that, but that does put some limitation into how much growth we can have this year versus next year. So, nonetheless, you know, we expect a very strong healthy growth this year, fiscal '24, and I believe that that's going to continue beyond fiscal '24. And we're on an inflection point in our business, and we're very excited about the opportunities for growth in the coming years.\n\nKevin McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd we think we have a line of sight on the supply chain necessary to meet our guidance levels.\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nFor this year, yes.\n\nKevin McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYes.\n\nGreg Konrad -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n\nAnd then, you know, we've seen the advances around AI, and I think you've called out, you know, a number of areas of progress. I mean, how do you think about monetizing that going forward, either through selling more systems or is there upgrade opportunities? Just trying to get a sense of what that can mean for the portfolio, you know, as that advances.\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSure. So, that's a really, really critical and important question, Greg, that you're asking. I'm glad you're asking it because I think that there's a lot of hype in the market with a lot of different players who claim that they have, you know, a lot of capability in terms of autonomy and all this. AeroVironment has been somewhat what I call quiet and humble in this area in terms of actually developing the capability and making sure that we deliver the capability in real world with our capability -- with our solutions.\n\nOne of the first products that we launched in this space this past year was called Puma Visual Navigation System. It's essentially a modular kit that you can buy that can be installed on all of our existing Puma systems essentially. And it allows a Puma system to not rely on GPS signal at all. It can literally find its location in space and chart a way to get to where it needs to go to based on an operator's instructions without reliance on GPS.\n\nSo, that's just the beginning. And we have the ability to do a lot more in this area. I expect us over the next several years to continue to grow this capability and announce additional enhancements and new kits of products, both hardware and software, in this space. Today, as you know, our business is primarily made up of hardware and services.\n\nWe expect that to change over time and, in fact, eventually include software as a selling item. Whether that could be a subscription or a license TBD, it depends, really, on our customers' acquisition process. But I feel really good about it, and we really have a lot of good positive momentum in this area that, I think, sets us apart from our competitors.\n\nGreg Konrad -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Jan-Frans Engelbrecht with Baird. You may proceed.\n\nJan-Frans Engelbrecht -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst\n\nGood afternoon, Wahid, Kevin, and Jonah. I'm on for Peter today.\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nKevin McDonnell -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nGood afternoon.\n\nJonah Teeter-Balin -- Senior Director, Corporate Development and Investor Relations\n\nHey. Good afternoon.\n\nJan-Frans Engelbrecht -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Congrats on a great quarter. So, just wanted to get a quick -- get a question in on the Switchblade 300 and sort of can you give us an indication of where you sit in terms of the DOD replenishment? I know you initially sent 700 drones, with the majority being 300 variants, and we just saw that $65 million order come in a couple of months ago. Can you sort of give us a sense of has that fully been replenished because we don't really know the full breakdown of how much France will be getting and also the other unnamed allied nation in that latest order?\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo, Jan-Frans, thank you for that question. So far, we have not really fully replenished the U.S. DOD's inventory. There's a few dynamics that's happening there.\n\nNumber one, we have delivered, so far, quite a lot -- a number of Switchblades to U.S. DOD, who, in turn, has provided them to the Ukraine forces. And they've been very happy with them, and they're asking for more and more of them. So, we continue to do that.\n\nThe process to replenish the U.S. DOD is most likely going to be more than a one-year process. It's going to continue beyond our fiscal year '24, in my opinion, and we're working on several fronts with the U.S. DOD to fulfill that need.\n\nA, the need will be bigger than before; B, they have really exhausted their inventories and we need to replenish them; and C, there's also additional demand from several additional countries. And so, as those countries grow and they get to use the product and their adoption grows, I think that our Switchblade family products is going to benefit and experience very healthy growth in the next year, as well as next couple of years. And obviously, this year, to some extent, it's limited based on lead times of primarily the warhead, as to how many warheads we can get. We have secured our needs for this year.\n\nBut for beyond this year's needs, we're still working on that. So, I think, overall, both Switchblade 300 and 600 is going to benefit from several demand drivers. Replenishment continue to deploy to Ukraine more. U.S.\n\ninventories will go up. The number of variants is now two of them, versus one, and the one has a higher average selling price. And then, of course, all the international demand. And then lastly, other platforms such as LRPM or OMFV with the GDLS, all those other programs and platforms are going to be an additional layer of demand for our Switchblade family of systems.\n\nJan-Frans Engelbrecht -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst\n\nPerfect. Thanks. That's really helpful. If I could just have a quick follow-up.\n\nSo, just in terms of the JUMP 20 system and the MUAS segment as a whole, so 2024 wouldn't have had a material revenue contribution from FTUAS. But sort of by all accounts, the JUMP 20 system has been highly durable, a lot of hours flown. So, obviously, a surprising decision there. But can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking beyond 2024 for that system and the MUAS segment as a whole in terms of sort of plugging the shortfall with [Inaudible] orders? And it seems like there's a lot of interest from foreign nations, but if you could just tell us how you're thinking sort of in 2025 onwards for that segment and product?\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSure, Jan-Frans. So, absolutely, we're still very bullish on our medium UAS category, the Group 2/3 UAS. Number one, this was one opportunity. We respect our customer's decision, but we're already engaged in asking them to provide more clarification as to why.\n\nWe're really, really surprised by that. But we're -- we have several other potential opportunities internationally that we're currently engaged in. The U.S. DOD specifically has selected JUMP 20 -- the only Group 2/3 UAV to provide to Ukraine for their conflict.\n\nAnd we have several other programs of record that we're chasing as well besides the U.S. Army's program. So, while we're disappointed with that outcome of that competition, we're going to continue to invest in it because we believe it's the best capability in the market. We believe Group 2/3 UAS actually is going to be a very strong growth market, specifically given the kind of conflicts that are going on around the world.\n\nUltra-long endurance and persistent ISR as a whole is a very large market and is going to have even a greater multibillion-dollar total addressable market. The TAM for Group 2/3, especially the JUMP 20 system, is fairly large, and it's actually growing faster than many other UAS markets. There's even an opportunity on the Group 2/3 category for us to conduct missions of Group 4/5 UAS at a fraction of the cost and at a fraction of the logistical footprint. So, overall, our investment thesis in Group 2/3 UAS and in our medium UAS business still is intact, and it's very bullish.\n\nWe're going to continue to invest in it. We have a series of enhancements and improvements and upgrades that we have planned to do in this space, and we're also engaged with multiple customers internationally to capitalize on those opportunities. And as you said, many of them have experimented and evaluated all the competitive offerings, and they do believe that the JUMP 20 is the best in class when it comes to its capability and value proposition against all competitors. So, we feel bullish about that still.\n\nJan-Frans Engelbrecht -- Robert W. Baird and Company -- Analyst\n\nOK. Great. Thanks for the detail. I really appreciate it.\n\nI'll jump back in the queue.\n\nWahid Nawabi -- President, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYou're welcome, Jan.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tim.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Tina, and welcome to everyone joining the call today. Lam posted strong results for the June quarter, with gross margin, operating margin, and earnings per share well above the guided ranges. CFPG at 47% of revenues in the quarter, continues to stand out as a key area of strength and stability for Lam and otherwise weak wafer fabrication equipment spending environment. Operationally, we achieved significant improvement in on-time delivery and critical back-order performance in the quarter and now see these metrics back at normalized pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOur focus on the resiliency of our global manufacturing and supply chain network is delivering greater predictability in the short term, but more importantly, positions us to scale more efficiently when WFE growth inevitably resumes. Looking near term, we see WFE spending in 2023, tracking to mid-$70 billion range, with the upside coming from domestic China-related spending, as well as strong growth in high-bandwidth memory or HBM-related demand. By device segments, we expect overall memory WFE to be down in the mid-20% range compared to last year and non-memory segments to be down approximately 10%. We continue to see second half 2023 WFE tracking higher than first half.\n\nWhile 2023 is a down year for WFE, the long-term growth dynamics for the semiconductor industry are strong. Emerging growth drivers such as generative AI are only in their initial stages of adoption and will be fundamental to driving increased investment in both memory and foundry logic fabs over the next several years. Advanced AI servers have significantly higher leading-edge logic, memory, and storage content versus traditional servers, and every incremental 1% penetration of AI servers and data centers is expected to drive $1 billion to $1.5 billion of additional WFE investment. This creates tremendous opportunity for Lam as greater etch and deposition intensity is needed to enable higher performance and more scalable device architectures.\n\nTo ensure we are best positioned to win long term, we have been making significant investments to broaden our product portfolio for processing at the atomic scale. Lam is the established leader in 3D NAND and we are well-positioned to benefit from the move underway to 3D in other device segments. At all around 3D DRAM and advanced packaging are important 3D inflections that are expected to drive strong SAM and share growth for Lam. Advanced packaging is becoming vital to the performance, power and cost road maps of high-performance applications, including generative AI.\n\nCustomers are increasingly adopting a wide variety of packaging schemes to enable logic and memory integration. Some of these schemes enable up to 50% improved memory density, 10 times improvement in bandwidth, and 60% gain in power efficiency. Lam has a track record of excellence in the Advanced Packaging segment with a strong set of manufacturing-proven products. Overall, we have greater than 50% market share in deposition and etch solutions required for advanced 3D stacking of high-bandwidth memory.\n\nMore specifically, our SABRE 3D copper electroplating tool and Syndion etch system holds 100% market share across all leading memory customers or through silicon via formation as a result of our long-established expertise in etching and filling high aspect ratio geometry structures. Overall, we expect our packaging SAM to double in the next five years. We also see our market position strengthening as we bring technology and productivity innovation to address emerging opportunities. For example, in the June quarter, we had a critical win for a new inter-dye gap fill application at a key foundry logic customer for their chiplet architecture.\n\nAs this latest win ramps into production, we will have secured a leading share position for this application across the top three foundry logic customers. We won this application for a couple of reasons. First, we delivered higher productivity relative to the competition by leveraging our unique triple quad platform architecture and multi-station sequential deposition chamber design. This enables film deposition of greater than 20 microns in a single pass, allowing the customer to run more wafers between chamber clean steps.\n\nSecond, we delivered superior on-wafer performance including better film stress management, improved defectivity, and enhanced wafer-to-wafer uniformity versus the competition. As we expand our position in newer high-growth markets like 3D packaging and specialty technologies, we have looked to leverage existing R&D and tools within the Lam portfolio to broaden our product offerings most efficiently. In the recent example, our long-established Kiyo Etch platform has proven to be highly suited to applications, which are critical to enabling new die-to-wafer hybrid bonding schemes. By delivering better etch profile than the competition, we secured a key win in the June quarter at a leading foundry logic customer.\n\nWe are currently the tool of record for a suite of etches and resist strip steps at this customer and expect to start recognizing revenue for the new application in 2023. As this customer continues to shrink packaging dimensions with future hybrid bonding iterations, we have the opportunity to double our revenue with them over the next several years. In another instance, Lam has been working with customers within the specialty segment to support key 300-millimeter etch solutions, including atomic layer etch to 200-millimeter to overcome challenges in the manufacturing of gallium nitride devices. Adoption of GaN technology is accelerating across multiple applications, ranging from high-efficiency charging devices for consumer electronics and automotive, to 5G RF infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the fabrication of such devices is complex and requires ultra-low damage etch processes with atomic-scale precision. With our suite of solutions, we can deliver a GaN etch process that improves surface roughness and other material properties that impact device performance. These solutions were developed as a result of Lam's deep understanding of the required technology, as well as key partnerships with customers and research institutions. Longer term, we look to outperform the $1 trillion semiconductor industry forecasted for the end of the decade.\n\nAt Lam, we are executing a strategy to create competitive differentiation by focusing on what we see as three key vectors of rising complexity. First is the technical complexity associated with enabling the transition to 3D device and packaging architectures across all our segments. Second is the support and workforce complexity arising from the expanding geographic footprint as regional efforts build momentum. And third is the sustainability complexity as we responsibly manage the carbon impact of the semiconductor industry as the output grows to $1 trillion.\n\nThis quarter, we detailed one component of our strategy in a press release for our semi versus solutions portfolio of advanced simulation and modeling products. These products are designed to help engineers get to process solutions faster, develop new products at lower cost, and collaborate across the global ecosystem with greater effectiveness. We believe that by combining the physical advantages of Lam's diverse global R&D and manufacturing footprint with the virtual development and digital twin capabilities of our semi versus solutions, we will be in an excellent position to innovate and outperform as our industry grows into the future. With that, I will turn it over to Doug.\n\nThank you.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nExcellent. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a very busy earnings season. We executed well in the June 2023 quarter with revenue coming in above the midpoint of our guided range, and our profitability metrics exceeding the high end of guidance.\n\nWhile we continue to work through a challenging WFE investment here, most notably with very low memory spending, our focus on improving our operational efficiencies is showing up favorably in our results. We're laser-focused on what's in our direct control and executing well. Let me dig into revenue. June quarter revenue came in at $3.2 billion, a decrease from the prior quarter as we expected.\n\nSystems revenue declined quarter over quarter as we had reduced levels of deferred revenue with the improvement in supply chain constraints. We closed the June quarter with $1.8 billion in deferred revenue on the balance sheet, which was a decrease of $165 million sequentially. We've got all the deferred revenue related to outstanding backward parts completely back to normal levels. As we discussed last quarter, though, our deferred revenue balance is currently still at higher than historic levels.\n\nThe deferred revenue balance includes increased customer cash and advanced deposits tied to orders from newer customers. We expect a significant portion of these deposits to convert to revenue during the second half of calendar year 2023. Let me now turn to the revenue segment details. Memory as a percentage of systems revenue in the June quarter was low at 27%, which was a decline from the prior-quarter level of 32% and our lowest concentration percentage for this segment in the last decade.\n\nThe DRAM segment within memory remained flat at 9% of systems revenue and NAND came down to 18% of systems revenue down from the March quarter level of 23%. We continue to expect NAND spending to remain at low levels for the remainder of the 2023 calendar year. And I just mentioned NAND spending is at the lowest levels we've seen since the advent of the 3D NAND architecture. Consistent with the prior quarter, we see strong concentration of systems revenue in the Foundry segment, with the June quarter revenue percentage at 47% versus 46% that we saw in the March quarter.\n\nInvestments were biased toward leading-edge devices. There also continues to be robust spending to support more mature specialty nodes. We had a record level of concentration in the Logic and Other segment with 26% of the systems revenue in the June quarter compared with 22% in the prior quarter. There was broad-based spending in areas such as advanced packaging, harder processors, analog, image sensors, and power applications.\n\nThese are areas where we've demonstrated strong momentum with our technology solutions, and I just point out that they are broadly distributed geographically. With respect to the regional composition of our total revenue, the China region was 26%, which was up a little bit from the prior quarter, which was 22%. China domestic customers majority of the China regional revenue in the June quarter. The result of strong concentration of investments by our customers in the Korea and Taiwan region which comprised 24% and 20% of our total revenues, respectively, in the June quarter.\n\nThe U.S. region declined from the record level that we saw last quarter largely due to the timing of customer projects. The customers for our business group revenue in the June quarter totaled approximately $1.5 billion, which was a decrease of 7% from the prior quarter level and 8% lower than the June quarter in calendar 2022. CSBG represented 47% of our June quarter revenue.\n\nThis is a historically high concentration percentage driven largely by continued strength in the specialty note investments, which are serviced by our reliance systems business. Our reliant and spares businesses continue to represent the largest individual portions of CSBG revenues. Both our spares and service businesses have been negatively impacted a low fab utilization levels, particularly at our memory customers. On the profitability side of things, our June quarter gross margin came in at 45.7%, above our guided range and up from 44% that we saw in the March quarter.\n\nThe quarter-on-quarter increase was related to cost and efficiency improvements, as well as a favorable product mix. We continue to expect to make further progress on our operational execution as we go forward. Operating expenses for June came in at $590 million, which was down from the $608 million in the March quarter, although it was a little bit higher than our original estimate coming into the quarter. Investing in research and development continues to be a top priority for Lam with over two-thirds of our operating expense concentrated in R&D.\n\nWe're focused on extending our product differentiation and ensuring that our competitiveness remains very strong. The June quarter operating margin came in at 27.3%, which was over the guidance range largely because of our strong gross margin performance. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter came in low at 7.5% due to a more favorable jurisdictional mix of income and provision true-ups that occurred at the end of our fiscal year. We estimate the tax rate for the remainder of the 2023 calendar year will be in the low to mid-teens level.\n\nAnd as always, this rate will have some fluctuation quarter to quarter. Other income and expense for the June quarter was approximately $7 million in expense, consistent with the prior-quarter amount and primarily related to our strong cash balances, as well as higher interest rates. And I'd just point out, from a return on cash standpoint, we're now realizing higher interest rates on our cash balances than we're paying on the longer-term duration debt in our capital structure. And as we've discussed in the past, [Inaudible] is subject to market-related fluctuations that will cause some level of quarterly volatility.\n\nFrom capital return activities, we allocated approximately $906 million to open market share buyback and we paid $232 million in dividends in the June quarter. We have $3.5 billion remaining on our Board-authorized share buyback plan. For the June quarter, we returned 109% of free cash flow, and we're very much in line with our long-term capital return plans of returning 75% to 100% of free cash flow. June quarter diluted earnings per share came in at $5.98 over the high end of our guidance range.\n\nThis was enabled from stronger revenue, improved gross margin and net lower tax rate. Diluted share count was 134 million shares on track with our expectations and down from the March quarter. Let me now come to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, totaled $5.6 billion, which was flat with the March quarter.\n\nThe sales outstanding were 80 days in the June quarter. June quarter inventory turns came down from the prior-quarter level of 1.9 times to 1.5 times. While we did bring inventory down slightly during the June quarter, the balance is elevated from historic levels. As business volumes reduce, we need to cancel a significant volume of purchase orders with our suppliers.\n\nAs we work through these cancellations, we're taking more inventory than we need in the near term. This ongoing process will keep inventory higher than we'd like this year, frankly. We do expect inventory to come down, though, albeit more slowly than we may have historically been able to drive it to. Noncash expenses for the June quarter included approximately $68 million in equity compensation, $76 million in depreciation, and $14 million for amortization.\n\nCapital expenditures were $79 million, which was down from the March quarter by approximately $41 million. Spending is mainly centered on product development activities and our global lab infrastructure. We ended the June quarter with approximately 17,400 regular full-time employees, which was a decrease of approximately 1,300 people from the prior quarter. Most of this decrease is related to the restructuring actions we took earlier in the calendar year with the timing of the headcount reduction showing up in the June quarter.\n\nOverall, we're on track with our transformation initiatives, to improve our operations. And as we stand at the end of the quarter, we incurred approximately $143 million year to date out of an anticipated $250 million estimated range for calendar year 2023. Let me now turn to our non-GAAP guidance for the September '23 quarters. We're expecting revenue of $3.4 billion, plus or minus $300 million.\n\nGross margin of 46.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. This improvement in gross margin is a function of our operational efforts, as well as a beneficial mix. Operating margins of 28%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. We're purposely spending a little more in R&D in the second half of 2023.\n\nAnd finally, earnings per share of $6.05, plus or minus $0.75 based on a declining share count of approximately 133 million shares. So let me summarize. The results this quarter demonstrate, I think, that we're on a solid path to strengthen our operations and our profitability profile. We're improving and optimizing all elements of the company, and solidifying Lam's business foundation to ensure we're well-positioned for outperformance when WFE growth resumes.\n\nAnd I'll just reiterate what Tim said, we continue to see WFE a little bit second half weighted this year. Operator, with that, that concludes my prepared remarks. Tim and I would now like to open up the call for questions.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nHarlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nHi. Good afternoon and congratulations on solid execution. As we progress through this weaker period for the industry, right? The activity level can be quite noisy. But there will come a period of stabilization of fundamentals and business trends, right? Fundamentals being the things that you can track like your customers' utilization and business-wise, the level of pushouts reschedules, and cancellations.\n\nSo, I guess with that, has the team seen utilizations starting to stabilize, albeit at low levels? And has the rate magnitude of shipment pushout rescheduling also come down to more normalized levels?\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Thanks, Harlan. I think that we've -- it probably varies by market segment. But clearly, we've heard some of our customers even just recently talking about more utilization cuts within certain device segments.\n\nClearly, I would say it's slowing down as the majority of the cuts that were made in the first half of the year kind of taking effect. I do feel like -- and I made a comment about, in some ways, normalizing our operations is allowing the business to be more predictable. I think the same thing is happening on the end markets and customer side as well, where people are getting a sense of how the cuts that have already been made and how the capex reductions that have already been made are starting to flow through. So, I do feel like we're in that position.\n\nAnd just as we, at this point, ticked a little bit up on WFE from our prior guidance of low to mid-70s to mid-70s. Yes, you're starting to see a little strength in certain parts of the market, HBM being one of them. And also, we mentioned some of the domestic China spending. So, I would feel like things are getting to the point where people are able to predict their business a little bit better than, say, six months ago.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd Harlan, this is Doug. Maybe the only thing I would add to what Tim said is we haven't really seen utilizations getting any better, quite frankly. You'll remember on the call last quarter, we talked about it, you'll see that from us in our spares and service components of CSBG. And as we sit here today, you're not seeing that at this point.\n\nSo, it's at a fairly low level, and we really don't see it getting any better in the near term.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nAnd the only other thing too, we have said that when you think about especially utilization improvements in the memory space, we would anticipate Lam being the first to sort of benefit from utilization earning back on. Just given our exposure in that space and the impact that it had on our spares and service business in the first half of this year.\n\nHarlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nI appreciate that. And then I also appreciate you guys highlighting the advanced packaging opportunity. I think it's quite timely, right, because you guys called out slightly better memory WFE trends due to strong HBM DRAM demand. So, you guys benefit both in your core memory silicon tools and now your advanced packaging portfolio as you outlined, right? But just given the overall sort of recent and strong demand pool for accelerated compute and AI capabilities, I mean, this is driving advanced packaging demand across CPU, GPU, networking, memory, right? And so, your customers are capacity-constrained here.\n\nSo, do you guys anticipate your advanced packaging segment to grow this year? And can you just give us some sense of how big this segment is for Lam?\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. I don't think -- we haven't exactly sized this business externally, but it is growing and as said, in certain areas, especially as I highlighted, things like etch for TSVs, copper plating for filling of those TSVs pretty much anything related to the to build that advanced packaging structure through etch and deposition. So, it is a strong area of our business right now, especially given the relative weakness as seen in the other parts of the market.\n\nHarlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Harlan.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nC.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess first question, Doug. Last quarter, you talked about expectations for 100 bps improvement, at least exiting the year.\n\nYou've clearly blown that away. So curious how much of that in the guide for September is due to mix versus kind of greater efficiencies that you've garnered. And what is kind of the new exit rate that we should be thinking about for calendar '23?\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, CJ, Actually, I think if you talk to the leadership team on Lam, we're all pretty pleased at where we've been able to drive the operational efficiency in the company. And it's gone quicker, I think, than I expected certainly. We're obviously beyond that 100-basis-point improvement. Having said that, though, I would point to -- we do have a component of the September numbers that are mix related.\n\nI'm not going to quantify it precisely for you. But we're doing really well operationally. I'm not quite ready to guide December for you yet, except I'd say I think we're pretty pleased where we're at, and we're well beyond that 100-basis-improvement we talked about, I think on January call, if I recall the first time we started talking about it.\n\nC.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\nGreat, thank you. I guess the second question relates to CSBG. And how are you thinking about sustainability of reliant? And then as you kind of contemplate the timing of utilization picking up from memory, how do you see kind of a handoff maybe from one part of the business to the other and how we should be modeling CSBG into September and beyond?\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. I think that, as you pointed out, I mean, obviously, there's a reliant component that right now is quite strong. I talked about specialty technologies. I mean, we're seeing still quite strong demand for our products across all of those different segments.\n\nUtilization driving spares and service to much lower levels than we've historically seen. And so, I think as people talk and worry about roll-off in the specialty technologies, maybe that does come at the time that the utilization picks up in the leading edge and the memory fabs. But actually, at this point, I would say we haven't yet seen demand for those trailing edge technologies to really be rolling over. I mean demand is still quite strong for us.\n\nWe're focused on new applications, new tool types and it's just not something that we're ready to forecast yet. Although again, as we've said, nothing grows forever, but it -- with the broadening it feels pretty good to us right now.\n\nC.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\nSo, we should be modeling CSBG up in September?\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nCJ, I guided you to $3.4 billion in revenue. You could do whatever you'd like to do with the competition. You've got the total number.\n\nC.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\nYeah, thank you, Doug and Tim. Appreciate it.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah, thanks, CJ.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nKrish Sankar -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\n\nYeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. And I have two questions. First one, maybe for Tim or Doug, kind of curious at SEMICON West a few weeks ago, Tokyo Electron spoke about a cryo etch product. And I remember you have spoken about it a couple of years ago.\n\nSo, I'm kind of curious how to think about your high aspect ratio etch market share. And my understanding was a lot of it was geared toward 3D NAND. And obviously, NAND spending is at a very low level. So, I'm kind of curious: A, number one, how to think about your high asset ratio market share and the cryo product, etc., in that route? And then I have a follow-up.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK. Great. Well, thanks, Christian. I'll take it first.\n\nI think that relative to NAND, as you pointed out, I mean, it's -- spending is at very low levels, down more than -- probably more than 75% year on year right now. But to this point of cryo, I mean, I guess I would just say that at this point, Lam is the only company with Kiyo etch in high-volume production. So, it's an area where we do have strength. I mean, hundreds of chambers of experience right now.\n\nWe're the leader in high aspect ratio etch. I know that at the recent conference, competition has been out talking about a DTOR position for one pass at a memory customer for a future node. But I think as probably everybody on this call knows customers regularly engage more than one vendor when you're in the R&D stage for all these critical applications. And in this case, production decisions are still quite a ways off.\n\nI look at Lam and our competitiveness. I mean we take all of that experience that we have from years of leading in this space. We've developed a robust technology road map. We're engaged with the customer on a variety of different hardware and process innovations.\n\nBut I think most importantly, when I think about our long-term competitiveness, we are still the only vendor that has this huge installed base from which every day we're getting learning about how to take processes from the R&D stage into high-volume production. And that's ultimately what really counts for affecting market share. And so, we've said in the past, we don't win every decision, certainly not always at the DTOR stage. But I think given where we are and where we've come from, we're very confident about maintaining leadership and market share in this space.\n\nKrish Sankar -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\n\nVery helpful, Tim. And then just a follow-up on the advanced packaging I understand you did mention the packaging and could double. And you spoke about the Syndion for TSV etch stable 3D for metal depth. If I remember, when I went back, looked at my notes, in 2015, you said it would be like a $200 million to $300 million opportunity.\n\nAnd then I think last year, folks updated both in 2020, where you said Syndion and stable actually doubled since then. I'm kind of curious, I understand a lot of it goes to HBM and all these things. So, from that whole realm of advanced packaging, how do think about like the opportunity from here? And also, for AI, my understanding is some of your ALD for high-K metal gate for DRAM can also be used. So, if I put it all together, is there a way to quantify where your Syndion stable revenue numbers are today? And how to think about it and also how to think about ALD for high-K metal? Thank you.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Well, you threw out a couple of numbers. We used to talk about a couple of hundred-million-dollar opportunity doubling from there, puts it in the hundreds. I mean it's growing from that point.\n\nIt's becoming a sizable business for us. we just haven't quantified specifically for those two products. I think what you can take away is we talked about our market share position. I think everybody knows HBM and 3D chip stacking, those products also play into other elements of advanced packaging.\n\nIt's a very fast-growing part of our business. And so, without giving you our forecast for those markets, I think you can apply what you think about how chip stacking and 3D packaging is building momentum. You know we have 100% market share. I think just -- we're very happy to see what's transpiring in that part of the market.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. And Krish, maybe I would just add. You're right about I don't know how long we quantified it as few hundred million dollars, not billions of dollars, just to kind of frame it for you, but it is a very fast-growing component of the business, as Tim pointed out. So maybe that's a good way to think about it.\n\nIt's something when you listen to everybody talk and everybody is very excited about high bandwidth memory and its able AI, we're right in the middle of all of that stuff from a packaging standpoint.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nKrish, what I would say is in this environment, those are the tool sets that people are actually pulling for in terms of accelerated deliveries. And so, I think that gives you some sense of demand in that market.\n\nKrish Sankar -- TD Cowen -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Thank you, Doug. Thanks, Tim.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from Tim Arcuri from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nTim Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nThanks a lot. Tim, there's been a lot of debate that I hear on NAND WFE. And obviously, you have the highest share of all the major vendors. And you used to give this model that suggested $14 billion to $15 billion per year to drive sort of mid-30% bit growth, and there was some sensitivity around it.\n\nBut since then, a lot of the producers have been basically down taking on long-term NAND bit growth, Micron is now saying low 20s. So, if you kind of use that old model, you get to something like $11 billion to $12 billion per year to drive low 20s bit growth? I know you've talked about more steps and so that number has gone up. But that's just optically, it's not a ton higher than the $9 billion or so that we're spending this year. And so, I keep on getting a ton of debate in terms of just how much NAND WFE is going to come back.\n\nSo, I'm not asking you for a new model, but can you sort of like handicap what's changed vis-a-vis that old model in a market where bit growth seems to be lower going forward than what [Inaudible]?\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, I think there probably is equal debate about what long-term etch growth is in the NAND space with some of the new applications coming out. But I'm certainly not going to get crossways with our customers in terms of their forecast versus ours. I mean again, it's a market where we have such a strong position that ultimately -- we look to side with technology road maps and the volume requirements of our customers, and that's kind of where we are. So right now, we know this year, NAND is extremely low.\n\nAnd without giving you our number, I mean it's -- I would say even if it got back to something close to that model, it's a lot higher spending than where we are today. I think what's happened, too is for Lam, specifically, is not only have we taken -- I mean, what might be different from that model of how much we capture of that SAM is the complexity of doing multi-tier stacking has increased our opportunity through a whole bunch of other steps that we've talked about in the past in terms of backside depth for stress management and gap fill -- ALD gap fills for plug fill, carbon sacrificial plug fills, lots of different types of applications. And so, I think even an environment where you didn't do a lot better than the model, Lam would do a lot better. and we do a whole lot better than where we are today in such a low NAND spending environment.\n\nSo, I think we will get Tim, a new model out once we see a better view of the end demand picture, but that's the best I can do for you right now.\n\nTim Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nThanks, Tim. And then, Doug, I guess just as a follow-up, how does your inventory situation play out? I imagine that it's still kind of a drag on gross margin, and you said it's going to come down, you said pretty slowly as you kind of get to the back half of the year. So, can you quantify how much of a drag it is as you're -- as you still have pretty high costs, I would imagine, on these parts? And then when do you think it gets back to some sort of normalized level, and it's not a headwind anymore to margin? Thanks.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, Tim, I don't really think about it right now as a drag on gross margin, honestly. It will prevent improvement in gross margin as we have to consume some of the inventory sitting there, right, to the extent that we're negotiating costs of some of the stuff that we have is already on the balance sheet, right? So, you've got to consume that first. So that's the right way to think about it. I don't really think of it as a drag in the near term.\n\nAnd Tim, it will come down, although what I tried to say in my script was it's going to come down a little bit more slowly than perhaps you've seen us be able to drive it to in the past because we canceled a lot of purchase orders, a lot of material in that as part of negotiating through that, you end up taking perhaps a little bit more than you need in the near term, we'll consume it over time. But it's just going to create a little bit of a delay in the reduction of inventory that you've seen us be able to do in the past. So, it's going to be a little bit sticky, I think, Tim, through the year. And then I think it will come down through the year, but I think it's going to be a little bit sticky.\n\nAnd then you'll see it improve as we get into next year.\n\nTim Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nThanks, Doug.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. Thanks, Tim.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from Brian Chin from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nBrian Chin -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\n\nHi, there. Good afternoon and thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Maybe just the backtrack on the increase to WFE this year of the, let's call it, $2 billion to $3 billion increase. Is that mainly situated in the second half? How should we think about, I guess, the timing between calendar 3Q and 4Q? And I guess how much of the upside is HBM oriented?\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, Brian, I guess what I'd say is it is a little bit second half weighted, and the things we pointed to in our scripts were a little bit of upside in China, China domestic, and a little bit of hide bandwidth memory. I don't think we're going to put a quantification between the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the calendar year, except to say it's a little bit second half weighted.\n\nBrian Chin -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\n\nOK. That's fair enough. Maybe for my follow-up, clearly, there's a lot of focus on high bandwidth DRAM. But Tim, I was wondering, could you interject maybe your thoughts on the role of the role that SSD and flash storage might play in generative AI? And I'm sure that's factored into sort of that 1% penetration for AI servers in kind of that $1 billion to $1.5 billion WFE investment.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nIt is. And I think that was even in my answer to the last question was, I think there's still a lot of debate as to how much storage really gets driven in this, but we're a believer that there is some element of demand-driven there. I think that when we think about DRAM, there's a couple of things at play in terms of what drives it. One is, of course, the HBM also increases die size, I think, as you know.\n\nAnd that leads perhaps even greater WFE increase associated both with the silicon side of that, as well as the packaging side. I'm not sure that same dynamic exists on the NAND side, but in terms of consumption, it feels like there should be some. But again, I'm willing to sort of let this play out a little further to see what the new model should be. And we talk closely to our customers to see what they're seeing in the marketplace as well.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, Brian, this is Doug. I don't know if this helps. But when I look at like the composition of some of these AI servers, nominally, there's roughly eight times the DRAM versus an enterprise class server and three times demand from a storage standpoint. I don't know if that will help you get your head wrapped around it.\n\nBut DRAM is clearly a little bit more enabling the compute side, but storage picks up also.\n\nBrian Chin -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\n\nOK. Got it. And probably scale out of these language models probably also could increase that storage potential over time. But thanks for your input.\n\nAppreciate that.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nToshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Tim or Doug, just on China, I was hoping you guys could give a little more color in terms of what you're seeing on the ground, Doug, I think you said China was 26% of revenue and a big chunk of that was domestic. What sort of the makeup by application, foundry, memory, and other? And I guess, importantly, how should we think about sustainability going forward? It's really hard to tell from our standpoint, just given the spend is so strategic, right? It's not necessarily directly to near-term economics.\n\nSo, it's hard for us. But in terms of what you're hearing from customers, what is the feedback? And how much visibility are you going forward?\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. I think that it's split. I mean, obviously, on the domestic China side between some memory investments, as well as a lot of specialty technologies, trailing edge focus on end markets, I think we're all familiar with automotive and industrial and those types of markets. As you mentioned, it's strategic.\n\nI mean, these are customers that are giving us long-term forecasts. Doug talked last quarter about deferred revenues are impacted by some of the down payments, at least within the visibility horizon that we need, we feel we have a pretty good view of a fair bit of investment that this continues in China, especially in those specialty technology markets where new fabs are emerging to try to capture some element of those trailing edge end markets.\n\nToshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, maybe one for Doug on gross margin. You talked about operational efforts and initiatives a couple of times what exactly are you doing today? I know there's no ending to things like this, but which inning are you in, in terms of reaping some of the benefits? And you used to talk about Malaysia as a headwind a year ago or a year and a half ago, where are you with the ramp there? And how should we think about the tailwind as volumes recover going forward? Thanks.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I think Toshi, the way to think about it is business is down. Right now, we're not really growing anywhere. I think as we see growth come back, whenever that is, the pivot to that Malaysia factory, which has an opportunity to do more than it's doing today, will be largely what you see from us.\n\nNow maybe to help with the restructuring activities, we embarked on plans to kind of restructure the cost footprint of the company. And maybe the best way to think about it, I've given you a forecast. We think we're going to take charges of $250 million at this point. We've taken $143 million at the end of the last quarter.\n\nSo, we still have some things we're working on. Although I would tell you the workforce portion of it is complete. We're done with that aspect of it. So that's behind us, we believe.\n\nSo, there's just some other things you're doing around looking at product, repositioning inventory, maybe a little bit of infrastructure stuff were embarked upon what will be a multiyear digital transformation initiative at the company, which will deliver efficiencies over the next several years. So, there's a handful of things that are still coming in the future, I guess, is what I would describe.\n\nToshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\n\nAppreciate the color. Thank you.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Toshiya.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Atif Malik from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nAtif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions on leading-edge investments. I thought you gave an interesting data point that 1% AI server adoption leads to $1 billion to $1.5 billion incremental WFE.\n\nWhen I listened to the major foundry in Taiwan, they talked about 50% AI semi-growth rate in the next few years, but you did not really raise capex this year. And we believe AI server adoption is probably like a high single digit, 8%, 9%. So, what explains the discrepancy in terms of not seeing a lift in leading-edge investments from the higher server adoption? Maybe it's just underutilization in other end markets.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nI guess what I think about it, Atif, is these are longer-term statements we're making, I think you're right about the composition of AI servers. In the short term, you're not really going to see a meaningful uptick in WFE, frankly. This is going to occur over the next several years. As more of -- and you're right, I think server volumes largely, I don't know, mid- to, I'd call it, mid-single digit percentage of total servers.\n\nI think that grows over time. But in the short term, it doesn't really show up as quickly as you might think. It requires sort of capital investments to occur for future demand. That doesn't really happen in a medium and in the short term.\n\nAtif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst\n\nGot it, Doug. And then as a follow-up, you guys are very well leveraged to get all around, particularly on the etch side, and have been waiting for this technology inflection for the last three years. Your peer in Europe is talking about pilot line orders in December quarter this year. And Tim spoke about having better visibility versus six months ago.\n\nSo, my question to you is, when do you see the gate-all-around opportunity kind of grow meaningful for you? Is it the first half of next year or second half of next year?\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nI think it starts in line with the timeline that you just talked about and it's through the first half and second half of next year. I mean these things tend to ramp and I think we are at the point where gate-all-around is going to become more meaningful. We'll see that in growth in some of the traditional products that are sort of lumped in with everything else. But then there are specialized products that we talked about, like selective etch those -- that suite of tools that's very specialized for applications like gate-all-around we'll see faster growth in those segments, I think, as we move through '24 and on into '25.\n\nSo yes, maybe we're at that key inflection point. How that overcomes the rest of the market dynamics in '24? We're not ready to guide '24 yet, but some of those technology trends are starting to move in our favor.\n\nAtif Malik -- Citi -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Atif.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nJoe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the China question. I guess, how are you seeing the impact of last year's export controls? Is that your China business has obviously done pretty well since then given the headwinds? Have there been -- have the restrictions been what you thought they would be? Is there anything that's different? And then there continue to be rumblings of additional controls.\n\nDo you have any visibility into what that could look like?\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah, Joe, we had talked toward the end of last year, right around the October 7 announcement that the impact on our business this year would be $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We clarified earlier this year that because we were able to make some shipments for trailing-etch memory that we had not -- we weren't sure whether we could that impact was going to be closer to the $2 billion mark. That is still what we estimate the impact of last year's restrictions, the October 7 restrictions on our business, $2 billion of revenue. Now at the same time, as China has shifted its focus toward the areas they can invest, these trailing etch, foundry logic, and some of the trailing edge memory, we've seen that upticking a bit as we've moved through this year, and that's what we just spoke about.\n\nSo, I can't really speak to future regulations that may or may not be contemplated. We have a team in Washington, D.C. that's regularly engaged with the government, make sure they understand our business and the details of the semiconductor industry, and that's about the best we can do right now.\n\nJoe Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nOK. Thank you very much.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Joe.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nVivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nThanks for taking my question. Tim, I'm curious, what should be the signs we should look for when memory utilization starts to pick up? And when orders to you guys start to improve? So, if you look at historical trends, should we be waiting for one quarter of pricing improvement, two quarters of pricing improvement? Just what are kind of the external metrics we should be keeping an eye on to try and predict when memory WFE should start to pick up?\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK, yeah, a little bit difficult, I guess, just from the standpoint that, obviously, pricing improvement in memory, we tend to start to get customers interested in greater utilization of the fab. I think easier, I was going to answer relative to what you'd see in Lam. Obviously, once we start reporting an uptick in our CSBG spares and service businesses, obviously, it's an indicator that fabs are starting to be utilized more, and therefore, consuming spares and services. That's why I mentioned a little earlier that we are expecting to be really one of the first beneficiaries of a recovery in memory because so much of the -- there have been such deep utilization cuts in the memory fabs, that the spares and service side of our business has been impacted to a greater degree than we would have expected.\n\nWhen they turn those back on, that revenue should come back, and that will probably be your first indications from Lam's reported numbers of what's going on.\n\nVivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nI guess that was really the origin of the question because from what I heard on the call, I think you were suggesting there is a scenario in which CSBG revenues do start to pick up sequentially in the next quarter. But then you mentioned that the visibility around memory utilization, right, is not there from an industry perspective. So, is there still a delta between the two?\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nVivek, we did not suggest CSBG picking up in the next quarter. That was not a statement anybody on the call made. So, if we said something that led you did that conclusion, maybe we misspoke or perhaps you misinterpreted something else we said.\n\nVivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nOK. Sorry. Maybe I misheard that. Then maybe for my second question, Doug, the gross margin upside in Q3, right, it was quite sizable.\n\nI don't remember the last time you had such a strong gross margin upside. I think you mentioned something along the lines of mix. Is that mix unsustainable? Is that likely to reverse, right, at some point? What is the right way to think about the sustainability of gross margins at these levels? So, let's say if you assume that your sales continue to grow sequentially, then can gross margins continue to be at plus minus these levels? Or is there something that would dramatically change in the mix to change the trajectory of gross margins?\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nVivek, I don't know if there's anything I'd point to that is dramatic. I suggested two things. One, our operational efforts in terms of just efficiencies and whatnot, it is maybe a little further ahead of where I thought it would have been. And I did point to favorable mix in the current quarter.\n\nYou always see mix up and down, both products, as well as customer mix. We're benefiting a little bit in the September quarter. I don't know if you'll see that same magnitude of mix benefit in December. The operational stuff, we will.\n\nI wouldn't run too far away from where we are right now into the near term anyway. But I would tell you, I'm very pleased with what we've been able to execute and the things that are in our own control, we've done extremely well.\n\nVivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nStacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. For my first one, you talked about the bulk of the China $1.8 billion in deferred selling through in the second half. How much of that $1.8 billion actually is coming from China? And how much of that do you actually see yourself recognizing in the second half? And is it more in Q3, Q4? Do you have any idea on the timing of that?\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I've never said how much of it is in China. I've described it as newer customers, right? Customers that are new that we're not exactly sure of the creditworthiness, we require cash in advance before we build the tools. I haven't put a number on how much of it is China.\n\nAlthough a decent amount of it is. And what I said on how much that turns to revenue, as I said, the majority of it turns to revenue in the second half of the year.\n\nStacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\n\nSo like you have $1.8 billion of revenue that will be recognized in the second half from that deferred? What would be the normal amount of [Inaudible] I'm just trying to get a few in the delta.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nNo, Stacy, there's a normalized level of deferred revenue that's always here, always has been here, and you should expect to always be here. It's probably $750 million to $1 billion -- on a regular basis, I think, is what you've seen from us in the past. I wouldn't expect it to be too different than that. We've just got a lot of this cash and advanced payments right now that's why it's elevated.\n\nStacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Thank you. For my second question, so, you're talking memory WP down in the mid-40s. Can you give us a feeling for how you see DRAM versus NAND breaking out in that? And whether or not your views on both of those have changed over the last 90 days versus like where we were a quarter ago?\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. We've said that NAND is obviously by far worse. We said about 75% year on year. So, obviously, that was quite that.\n\nI mean DRAM then obviously less than down mid-40s. And I think that in terms of change, we've seen a little bit of improvement, as we've just talked about with HBM, and some signs of at least a little bit more optimism on our part that the DRAM would be the first to recover as a result of some of these trends. And again, just listening to our customers and talking to them, we've heard some customers talk about further cuts in NAND just in the last 24 hours.\n\nStacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\n\nDo you think utilization in DRAM is still falling?\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nIt's still at a pretty low level, Stacy.\n\nStacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\n\nOK. Got it.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nBlayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nHey, thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe just following back up on what Stacy just asked. I was just kind of confused. You raised the outlook for WFE by a couple billion dollars, and it seemed like it was memory, that was the inflection.\n\nBut then when you talk about memory, it seems like NAND is kind of flattish. And I'm just kind of curious how much of the increase is there in DRAM? Or is really the growth you're seeing in September more kind of this China part that Stacy was just asking about?\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, Blayne, Tim pointed to two things. A little bit more in China and high-bandwidth memory as -- it's not a huge uptick in WFE, but those are the contributors.\n\nBlayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nGotcha And then I guess, I just want to understand, there's two moving pieces in foundry logic, and you've seen some delays at the leading etch. Can you just some commentary between those moving pieces, kind of the non-China piece, what are you seeing for the back half of this year?\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nWe described in general, when you look at WFE down, where it is memory is down mid-40s, and you probably know kind of where that is run rating suggested foundry logic, looks like it's down roughly 10%. And yeah, you're right, just been a little bit of a softening in leading-edge foundry logic. We talked a little bit about that last quarter. I'm not sure we're describing anything incremental.\n\nPerhaps we saw some things others didn't see sooner than they did. But that's how we see things setting up right now.\n\nBlayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nOK. Thanks, Doug.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Blayne.\n\nTina Correia -- Corporate Vice President, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, our final question will come from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nVijay Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Hi. Just a question on -- as you look at WFE for next year, any thoughts on how much some of these onshore greenfield fabs could contribute to capex for next year?\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, I think it's -- as we're just in the middle of this year, it's too early to talk about '24 from an absolute number. But clearly, as we move through the next couple of years, I talked about these regionalization efforts building momentum. I do think that we'll see that becoming a meaningful contributor to spending, not only here but in other parts of the world.\n\nVijay Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\n\nGot it. And then on the AI side, obviously, you have mentioned packaging as a big road map there. When you look at CoWoS packaging, any thoughts on how much what your exposure is there and how you see that growing next year, I guess? Thanks.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. I mean everything related to advanced packaging is growing right now. And I would say Lam's exposure kind of across the board in etching deposition is very strong. So, I called out specifically HBM, but you're right.\n\nI mean when you look at the importance of things like CoWoS-2 and AI packaged system, our exposure there even broadens further to the types of tools that we sell in there. And I mentioned at this point, if people caught it, even in advanced packaging, we're having to invest in new technologies for atomic scale processing. And so, you can see things like ALD being used in advanced packaging now. And so, we're really in a world where ALD is being used for advanced packaging.\n\nALE is being used for 200-millimeter GaN. I think that it is creating tremendous opportunities for Lam to leverage our really broad portfolio of technologies for all these new emerging growth opportunities. And it's pretty exciting.\n\nVijay Rakesh -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nTim Archer -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Thank you.\n\nDoug Bettinger -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Vijay.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd with that, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be turning the floor back over to the management team for any closing remarks.

Today's press release and supplementary financial data tables have been posted to our website. Today's format will consist of providing you with highlights of our second quarter results, as described in our press release announced earlier today, followed by a question-and-answer session. Gary will present the quarter's business and operational highlights, Jamie will provide a review of our financial results, then I will discuss procedure and clinical highlights and provide our updated financial outlook for 2023.\n\nAnd finally, we will host a question-and-answer session. And with that, I will turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you for joining us today. The fundamentals of our business were healthy in the second quarter, with strong procedure and utilization growth and strong capital placements. Our product operations teams continued to build capacity and deliver in a dynamic supply chain environment as customers increasingly rely upon us for routine use. Our research and development efforts continued to build momentum in the quarter, including positive development milestones for our Intuitive ecosystem, including systems, instruments, accessories, digital tools, and new indications.\n\nTurning first to procedures. Growth in the quarter was 22%. Areas of strength included general surgery and gynecology for benign conditions, particularly in the United States. General surgery procedure growth was led by cholecystectomy and hernia repair.\n\nColon and rectal procedure growth was healthy. Global procedure growth was also strong in the quarter, led by a recovery in China and continued strength in Japan, Germany, and the U.K. Ion procedures showed continued strength with 145% growth in Q2 of '23. SP procedure growth was accretive, with 40% global growth in the quarter, driven by accelerating growth in the United States.\n\nOn the capital front, we placed 331 systems in Q2, compared with 279 systems in Q2 of last year. Our clinical installed base now stands at 7,900 multiport da Vinci systems, 435 ion systems, and 142 single-port da Vinci systems. Overall, our capital placement trends reflected demand for additional capacity in multiport, strong interest in our ion system, and stable demand for SP as we build our SP indications. System utilization, defined as procedures per installed clinical system per quarter, grew 9% globally year over year, reaching a new high as customers adopt a broad mix of procedures on our systems.\n\nWe believe real-world evidence of improvements across the quadruple aim, from better patient outcomes to surgeon satisfaction and lower total cost to treat per patient episode, underpin this increasing utilization. Turning to our finances. Our revenue grew 15% in the quarter. Our capital and operating expenses were within our spend guidance, reflecting continued investments in R&D to support growth of our platforms and digital tools, expansion of our manufacturing and commercial footprints, and capital amortization.\n\nWe will continue investing in R&D, manufacturing, and commercial operations to serve our global markets at an industrial scale. These investments are likely to be lumpy over the next couple of years as significant operations expansions and other projects complete. Taking a step back, we've found that the quadruple aim is the right North Star for us, focusing on demonstrable improvements to outcomes across specific procedures and patient populations, increasing patient and care team satisfaction, and lowering the total cost to treat per patient episode. As electronic medical records have been adopted, we have partnered with our customers to analyze this data, building real-world evidence and big data approaches to measure quadruple aim improvements within countries, regions, and health systems.\n\nPared with our ecosystem investments in training, services, and products and powered by digital tools that can generate actionable intelligence from surgical data, we can help our customers analyze their programs, recommend and support actions to improve performance, and lower total costs. This integrated business system is catalyzing our customer's goal of strong MIS programs by servicing actionable and measurable steps. Our approach is scalable for us, too, working for our da Vinci platforms and for ion and opening the door to future opportunities. Turning to our ecosystem investments.\n\nWe're making solid progress extending our offerings to new clinical domains and new regions. For da Vinci multiport, we recently obtained NMPA registration for Xi local production in China. This means our da Vinci Xi will be able to compete for the locally sourced tenders subset of the recently released updated national quota. Our da Vinci SP team achieved several milestones recently.\n\nWe completed patient enrollment for our colorectal and our thoracic IDE trials, continued our first phase of launch of SP in Japan, and submitted our CE Mark dossier for SP in Europe. Turning to ion. Our team installed their first ion system in the U.K. and initiated first cases.\n\nFor our digital tools, we have initiated our phase 1 launch of Case Insights, our name for our computational observer. Case Insights is a tool that works with the da Vinci system and hospital data to build AI models that find correlations between surgical technique, patient populations, and surgical outcomes. Our first phase of launch builds on work over the past few years with our clinical research partners to refine objective performance indicators and link them to actionable changes to improve outcomes, shorten training times, and improve surgical program efficiency. We think these computational tools can make a significant impact, using real-world and real-time data to improve skills and outcomes and to inform future product and automation opportunities.\n\nThat said, features can be built quickly but long-term validation is arduous. We're a science-driven organization, and we'll work through validation pathways in pursuit of long-term success. We do not expect material revenue from Case Insights for the next several quarters. In closing, our core business has momentum.\n\nWe see a significant long-term opportunity to improve the quadruple aim using our integrated ecosystem, powered by analytics. And we are pacing our investments to catalyze that opportunity. I'll now turn the time over to Jamie, who will take you through our finances in greater detail.\n\nJamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nGood afternoon. I will describe the highlights of our performance on a non-GAAP or pro forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP performance later in my prepared remarks. The reconciliation between our pro forma and GAAP results is posted on our website.\n\nGlobal procedure growth in Q2 of 22% reflected U.S. procedure growth of 19% and 28% procedure growth outside of the U.S. Procedures in Q2 benefited from higher patient admissions as hospitals, particularly in the U.S., catch up with patients whose diagnosis and/or treatment was delayed during the pandemic. Consistent with our comments last quarter, contributions to procedure growth from surgeons new to the da Vinci platform were strong, reflecting both the strength of our training capabilities and an increasing number of graduates of residency and fellowship programs who are trained on da Vinci.\n\nWithin one of our target procedure areas, bariatric surgery, our growth rate in the U.S. slowed during the quarter. Some customers have indicated that they are seeing increased patient interest in weight loss drugs. It is too early to conclude if the slowing growth is a temporary pause as patients evaluate these new drug therapies or if it is a trend that continues.\n\nWe believe that during the quarter, da Vinci continued to gain market share in the bariatric surgical market. Our U.S. procedure growth of 28% reflected strength in China, the U.K., Germany, and Japan. Strong procedure growth in China was driven by a continued recovery from more recent COVID-related impacts and a favorable comparison to Q2 last year, which was also impacted by the pandemic.\n\nConsistent with our comments last quarter, growth in non-urology procedures outside of the United States was accretive, growing at approximately 35%, driven by increases in colorectal, hysterectomy, and thoracic procedures. Turning to other key metrics. In Q2, the installed base of da Vinci systems grew 13% to just over 8,000 systems, driven primarily by demand for additional capacity given procedure growth. Average system utilization grew almost 9% year over year, reflecting an increasing mix of shorter-duration benign procedures in the U.S.\n\nand customers prioritizing use of their existing assets given the financial pressures they face. With respect to capital performance, we placed 331 systems in the second quarter, ahead of our expectations. Capital strength in the quarter included a higher number of placements to our distributors and a higher number of multisystem deals in the U.S. relative to recent trends, reflecting, in part, certain placements accelerated into Q2 from future quarters.\n\nDespite Q2 system placements being ahead of our expectations, customers, particularly in the U.S., appear to be cautious in their capital spending given ongoing financial pressures. We placed 279 systems in Q2 of last year, which, as a reminder, reflected a delay in the shipment of approximately 15 systems from June into July as a result of supply chain challenges we encountered during the quarter. Q2 revenue is $1.8 billion, an increase of 15% year over year. On a constant currency basis, second quarter revenue grew approximately 17%.\n\nRecurring revenue represented 85% of total revenue, as compared to 72% for the full year 2019, and grew 20% over last year, driven by procedure growth and an increase in the installed base of systems under operating lease arrangements. Additional revenue statistics and trends are as follows. In the U.S., we placed 157 systems in the second quarter, compared to 150 systems placed last year. Outside the U.S., we placed 174 systems in Q2, compared with 129 systems last year.\n\nCurrent quarter system placements included 76 into Europe, 33 into Japan, and 16 into China, compared with 78 into Europe, 18 into Japan, and 15 into China in Q2 of last year. During the quarter, the China National Health Commission published the 14th Five-Year Quota of 559 robotic systems. For those systems awarded to our JV under the new quota, we expect a significant majority to be placed in 2024 through 2027. We are seeing increasing participation of local competitors in tender processes under the national quota.\n\nIn addition, during 2023, we have experienced pricing pressure in China as a result of provincial government policy changes and competition. These dynamics create greater variability in the outlook for our procedure, system placement, and revenue performance in China. In Q2, 60 of the 331 systems placed were trade-in transactions, compared to 56 trade-in transactions in the second quarter of last year. As of the end of Q2, there are approximately 500 SIs remaining in the installed base, of which 97 are in the U.S.\n\nLeasing represented 50% of Q2 placements, compared with 42% for both last quarter and last year. In the U.S., 78% of system placements in Q2 were under operating lease arrangements, compared to 59% last quarter. The higher rate of operating leases in the U.S. is primarily driven by an increasing customer preference for our usage-based leasing models, in part, due to capital budget constraints and continuing financial pressures faced by many of our customers.\n\nIn addition, some customers are choosing leasing structures to preserve flexibility to upgrade to next-generation technology. As a result of these dynamics and the earlier stage of our leasing program with OUS customers, we continue to expect that the proportion of placements under operating leases will increase over time. Q2 system average selling prices were $1.39 million, as compared to $1.47 million last quarter. The sequential decrease in system ASPs was primarily driven by a higher mix of ex placements for purchase deals and geographical mix.\n\nWe recognized $12 million of lease buyout revenue in the second quarter, compared with $24 million last quarter and $23 million in Q2 of 2022. da Vinci instrument and accessory revenue per procedure was approximately $1,840, compared with approximately $1,780 last quarter and $1,900 last year. On a sequential basis, higher I&A per procedure was driven primarily by the I&A price increase we described last quarter and customer ordering patterns. Turning to our ion platform.\n\nIn Q2, we placed 59 ion systems, as compared to 41 in Q2 of 2022. Second quarter ion procedures of approximately 12,700 increased 145% as compared to last year. During the quarter, we placed our first ion system in the U.K. market.\n\nAnd in this early phase of our European launch, we are focused on the collection of clinical data in support of our reimbursement strategy. Twelve of the systems placed in the second quarter were SP systems, compared to 10 systems last quarter. SP procedures grew by 40%, and average system utilization growth accelerated from last quarter's 12%, increasing by 14% compared to Q2 of last year. Moving on to the rest of the P&L.\n\nPro forma gross margin for the second quarter was 68.5%, compared with 67.2% last quarter and 69.2% last year. Pro forma gross margin was lower than last year, primarily due to a higher mix of ion revenue, which currently carries significantly lower margins as compared to the da Vinci business and lower system ASP. As we described last quarter, improving product costs and manufacturing efficiency is a priority for our teams over the medium term. Second quarter pro forma operating expenses increased 12% year over year, driven primarily by increased headcount added throughout last year, higher variable compensation, increased prototype expenses, and increased expenses associated with customer training in support of procedure growth.\n\nPro forma operating expenses represented 33% of revenue in Q2, compared to 35% of revenue for the full year 2022, reflecting, in part, planned leverage in our enabling functions. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $178 million, primarily comprised of infrastructure investments to expand our facilities footprint and increased manufacturing capacity. Our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was 22.3%, consistent with our expectations. Second quarter pro forma net income was $507 million, or $1.42 per share, compared with $415 million, or $1.14 per share, for Q2 of last year.\n\nI would now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $421 million, or $1.18 per share for the second quarter of 2023, compared with GAAP net income of $308 million, or $0.85 per share for the second quarter of 2022. The adjustments between pro forma and GAAP net income are outlined and quantified on our website and include excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards, employee stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, and gains and losses on strategic investments. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $7.1 billion, compared with $6.6 billion last quarter.\n\nThe sequential increase in cash and investments reflected cash from operating activities, proceeds from employee stock exercises, partially offset by capital expenditures. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Brian, who will discuss clinical highlights and provide our updated outlook for 2023.\n\nBrian King -- Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Jamie. Our overall second quarter procedure growth was 22% year over year, compared to 14% for the second quarter of 2022 and 26% last quarter. In the U.S., second quarter 2023 procedure growth was 19% year over year, compared to 11% for the second quarter of 2022 and 26% last quarter. Q2 growth continued to be driven by strong growth in procedures within general surgery, with particular strength in cholecystectomy and hernia repair.\n\nBariatrics growth was healthy in the quarter, but as noted earlier, growth was lower than in prior periods. Outside of the U.S., second quarter procedure volume grew 28%, compared with 22% for the second quarter of 2022 and 28% last quarter. Second quarter 2023 OUS procedure growth was driven by continued growth in general surgery, primarily from strong growth in colorectal procedures, followed by growth in thoracic procedures. Growth in urology continued to be healthy, led by kidney procedures, along with continued double-digit growth in prostatectomy.\n\nIn Europe, we experienced strong growth in the U.K., Germany, and Spain. In all the regions noted, procedure growth was driven by colorectal and hysterectomy procedures. In Asia, growth was led by China, where we saw a continuing recovery in procedures that were impacted by COVID and benefiting from a favorable comparison to procedure volume that was impacted in the same quarter a year ago. Procedure growth was led by strong growth in urology, namely prostatectomy and kidney procedures.\n\nIn Japan, growth was led by general surgery, with the largest procedure contributions coming from colorectal and gastrectomy procedures. While still at earlier stages of adoption, India and Taiwan both demonstrated strong growth in gynecology and general surgery procedures. Now, turning to the clinical side of our business. Each quarter, on these calls, we highlight certain recently published studies that we deem to be notable.\n\nHowever, to gain a more complete understanding of the body of evidence, we encourage all stakeholders to thoroughly review the extensive detail of scientific studies that have been published over the years. This past May, Dr. Zheng from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Jiaxing University in China published a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing outcomes of robotic right colectomy procedures, with outcomes associated with laparoscopic right colectomy. Published in Techniques in Coloproctology, this meta-analysis evaluated a total of 15,241 patients across 42 studies, with over 2,700 subjects in the robotic right colectomy group and over 12,000 subjects in the laparoscopic group and included outcomes associated with the entire population, as well as outcomes for both intracorporeal and extracorporeal anastomosis.\n\nLooking at the population overall, the authors reported, among other outcomes, an approximately half day shorter length of hospital stay, 51% lower risk of conversion to laparotomy, and a 12% lower risk of complications with the robotic approach. Notably, in the subgroup specifically comparing outcomes for procedures with an intracorporeal anastomosis, the robotic right colectomy group was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay by approximately 16 hours and a 65% lower risk of conversion to laparotomy. Within the extracorporeal anastomosis subgroup, the robotic-assisted approach was associated with a 40% lower risk of overall complications. The authors concluded, in part, that \"The safety and efficacy of robotic right colectomy is superior to laparoscopic right colectomy, especially when an intracorporeal anastomosis is performed.\" Turning to a clinical study reporting outcomes for robotic-assisted and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.\n\nDr. Mirza Baig from Danbury Hospital in Connecticut published outcomes comparing lobectomies performed with either approach using the National Cancer Database. This study focused on patients with complex etiology such as non-small cell lung cancer who had received neoadjuvant therapy, had N1/N2 disease, or had a tumor greater than five centimeters and compared 9,500 subjects, with over 2,100 in the robotic arm and over 7,000 in the VATS arm. Notably, when analyzing rates of conversions to open, the author has reported a 7.7% lower rate of conversion to open in the robotic arm, with an approximately two times higher risk of conversion associated with the VATS group.\n\nThe authors concluded, \"In summary, our analysis of the National Cancer Database suggests that robotic lobectomy for complex lung resections achieves similar perioperative outcomes and R0 resections as VATS lobectomy with the exception of a lower rate of conversion to thoracotomy.\" I will now turn to our financial outlook for 2023, starting with procedures. On our last call, we forecasted full year 2023 procedure growth within a range of 18% to 21%. We are now increasing our forecast and expect full year 2023 procedure growth of 20% to 22%. The low end of the range reflects uncertainty around the duration of elevated procedure volumes with patients returning to healthcare, continued slowing of bariatric growth rates in the U.S., and macroeconomic challenges that could impact hospitals and patient spending.\n\nAt the high end of the range, we assume macroeconomic challenges do not have a significant impact on hospital procedure volumes and bariatric growth rates in the U.S. continue at the rate we saw in Q2. The range does not reflect significant material supply chain disruptions or hospital capacity constraints. Turning to gross profit.\n\nWe continue to expect our 2023 full year pro forma gross profit margin to be within 68% and 69%. Our actual gross profit margin will vary quarter to quarter, depending largely on product, regional, and trade-in mix and the impact of new product introductions. With respect to operating expenses, on our last call, we forecast pro forma operating expense growth to be between 11% and 15%. We are adjusting our estimate and now expect our full year pro forma operating expense growth to be between 12% and 15%.\n\nWe are also updating our estimate for noncash stock compensation expense to range between 600 million to 620 million in 2023, narrowing the range from our previous estimate of 600 million to 630 million. We are increasing our estimate for other income, which is comprised mostly of interest income, to total between 160 million and 180 million in 2023, an increase from our previous estimate of 140 million and 160 million. The increase primarily reflects the rise in interest rates. With regard to capital expenditures, we continue to estimate a range of 800 million to 1 billion, primarily for planned facility construction activities.\n\nWith regard to income tax, we continue to estimate our 2023 pro forma tax rate to be between 22% and 24% of pre-tax income. That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call to your questions.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator instructions] We'll go to the first question. It's from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, just two for me, one big-picture question on AI and second on procedure growth. So, AI is obviously having its moment in the sun here, Gary.\n\nI'm curious, where is Intuitive spending time in applying AI? Is it imaging, you know, movement of the robot, you know, training? I'd love to hear your thoughts, and then I had one follow-up.\n\nGary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Well, I'll start on AI. Let's talk about what it is. You know, for us, it's a suite of digital tools that rests on a baseline and then can be built upon using various machine learning techniques, including computer vision.\n\nWe've been at it for some time. We started the Internet of Things for surgical robots over a decade ago. We built the baseline of cyber-secure privacy compliant pipes that allow us to get access to the data. So, there's some foundational work that was important.\n\nThat's kind of step one. Step two is to collaborate with customers and aggregate data that is meaningful. AI is only as good as the quality of the data that you feed it. And so, for us, that has been robot data, some other data, and electronic medical record data in partnership with our customer base.\n\nWe've been doing that for several years now. From that, I think you can start to do analytic inspections. You can do analyses on the data, look for correlations. Sometimes, it's pretty simple math that gets you big data explorations, some simple things that we can do to help our customers become more efficient and to expose variation.\n\nOver time, you can invest further in things like computer vision, which we have been doing, and into predictive analytics. The idea that you can look at surgical data science, understand the variation of patient populations and what's happening in surgery, and start to create tools -- digital tools that can help improve outcomes or speed learning curves or lower operating costs. And we're going to work on all of those things. So, of the things you mentioned, we have our toe in the water in many, and we've had for some time.\n\nAs I said in the script, the feature content can be moved pretty quickly. I think the validations take real time to do well, particularly outcome-based or interventional validations. And so, we're going to go through and do that with real rigor. So, expect us to continue down that pathway.\n\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\nThat's very helpful. And then on procedures, I'm just wondering, you talked about some catch-up in Q2. How are you thinking about, you know, how much of the backlog of deferred procedures is still left? You talked about, you know, the diagnostic procedures on the last call. And any color on, you know, what you're assuming for bariatrics here for the rest of the year? And does that mean, you know, international will continue to be stronger than the U.S.? Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nGary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, let me talk a little bit about, I think, the patient population that moved to the sidelines during the pandemic, and then I'll turn the assessment over to Jamie. On the kind of the pandemic response, it's hard to exactly estimate how many folks would have been in diagnostic pipelines that did not get their tests. We do look at the data that's available to do that. I don't think it will clear in just one quarter.\n\nI think our past experience on these things is that lower utilization happened over several year period and it will probably take many quarters for it to fully recover. How long that is, I think, is very, very hard to estimate. So far, so good. You asked a question about bariatrics.\n\nYou know, I'm going to turn that over to Jamie. He spoke about it a little bit in his prepared remarks.\n\nJamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. What we saw in Q2 was that growth rate slowed. We have some input from customers that the level of patient interest is such that patients are now considering drugs versus surgery. It's unclear yet, based on that set of inputs from customers, the duration of that evaluation by parents -- patients, and obviously, it's layered.\n\nSo, what we did for our guidance was we just set it at the high end for the remainder of the year. The bariatrics growth rate in the U.S. is consistent with what we saw in Q2. And at the low end, we said that the growth rate continues to slow a little bit over the course of the year as patients become increasingly educated about the weight loss drugs.\n\nAnd obviously, there's a number of factors that patients have to consider with respect to those drugs: cost, side effects, what happens if they come off the drugs and regain weight, etc. But I think, from our perspective, we're early in understanding what the longer-term impact will be. Customers have said that they have confidence that there is a role for surgery in weight loss and that that will endure over kind of the longer term. What happens in -- for the rest of the year, I think, we'll see.\n\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we'll go to the next question, go to the line of Travis Steed, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nHey. I did want to ask about China and the China quota and how you think the opportunity is now that there's more local players, but you also have the local version of Xi. And on the bari, just a quick follow-up on that, too. Is that around 100,000 procedures? Just trying to think about sizing the -- that bariatric surgery opportunity or impact?\n\nJamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nWe've said market size in the U.S. is about 200K procedures annually for what we think is a good match for robotics. And in terms of where we are in penetration, we're kind of at the -- if I put it in quartiles, we're at the beginning of the second quarter. What was your first question, Travis?\n\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nIt was on China and the China quota and how to think about that opportunity there versus last quotas given there's more local players, but now, you have the local version of Xi?\n\nJamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I mean, obviously, there's increased opportunity in the sense that this quota -- this 559 systems relative to the prior quota of 225 systems, but you also have now five local players. There will be government interest in success of local players. We do believe that surgeons cared about capability and feature set.\n\nAnd so, the extent to which da Vinci continues to be differentiated, I think, is to our advantage. In the -- and we are seeing those local players increasingly participate in tenders. With respect to how their quota will be allocated, so it gets allocated from the central government to the provinces, and then it goes through tender processes. So, there is some time before that results in placements, and that's why we said in our prepared remarks, we think the bulk of the subset of that quota, the -- our JV wins will be in '24 through '27.\n\nI also described some dynamics that create greater variability with respect to pricing pressure and increasing competition. So, I think, for us, that's something that we're going to watch carefully over the next year or so.\n\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nAll right. Great. And a question for Gary. I heard the comment on hospitals leasing more to preserve the upgrade option for the next-gen system.\n\nSo, maybe just talk high level the pipeline comments on the FDA and kind of supply chain bottlenecks that you saw last year and then -- and how you're thinking about incremental upgrade to the Gen 4 versus kind of new platforms?\n\nGary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nSure. On the supply chain health side, we are seeing fewer pockets of challenge, but some pockets nonetheless. So, there's been significant focus and attention to make sure that we're supplying our customers what they need as we go through a pretty nice procedure growth curve. So, they're calling out improvement in the breadth of supply chain challenge but cautioning that there are still some pockets that need attention or require attention.\n\nWe continue to work on multiple things. As you know, we're working on next generations of our platforms in general. It is a routine activity for us. How we make the decision between upgrading a current generation versus moving it to the next generation really is around customer value of that switch and the convenience and economics of doing an upgrade versus a platform changeover.\n\nAnd we expect to do some of both. We are usually working on the next two generations because of the time it takes to develop a platform, not just the next one, but the next one after that. And current time is really no different. We're pleased with the performance of our engineering teams in prosecuting those upgrades in technologies.\n\nWhat I will say is, you know, prioritization-wise, what we care about is can we improve patient outcomes in a real way or open a new population of patients to the benefits of minimally invasive surgery. So, we look at that. We look to improve the surgeon and care team experience, whether that's in their ergonomics or their workflow and the delight with which they perceive our systems. We work to improve efficiencies of overall programs.\n\nWe'll work on things that make hospital programs more efficient, and we work to lower the total cost to treat per patient episode. And when we find feature sets in technologies that do that, then we get pretty excited about them and drive them hard.\n\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Super helpful. Thanks, Gary.\n\nOperator\n\nOK. Our next question is from the line of Robbie Marcus, J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really nice quarter. I heard the comment on prototype expenses are increasing, so I figure I'll try my luck here, and I know you're not going to tell us when the next-gen or if a next-gen system is coming. But I want to ask around just implications if and when one does.\n\nYou have a lot of leases now. Do they have the option to upgrade and will that come through as -- at higher revenues? And how do we think about the prototyping expense and, really, what's that for? Thanks.\n\nJamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I'm not going to be specific on the prototype expense, and it's distributed across a number of programs. Prototype expenses tend to be lumpy within Q2 relative to the comparison point. It just so happened to be a quarter where that was one of the drivers of our expenditure.\n\nNothing more than that that I would say. As we've grown the proportion of the installed base that's under leases, I think it's about 2,000 systems now that are under lease in the installed base. Generally, they have a technology obsolescence clause. That's kind of, in part, a reflection of customer feedback from when we launched Xi.\n\nSo, that's routinely in our operating lease arrangements. And that clause generally gives customers the opportunity to change that existing lease to the lease of any new next-generation technology. And there is no specified price, by the way. That's to be negotiated.\n\nSo, I wouldn't say anything more about price.\n\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nGreat. And maybe, Jamie, one more for you on the financial side. Another nice quarter of cash flow generation, north of $7 billion on the balance sheet. Interest rates, high; inflation, high as well.\n\nHow are you thinking about maximizing the cash here and how should we think about the priorities? Thanks.\n\nJamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nWith respect to capital allocation, I think our priorities are consistent for how they've been for some time now. Our first priority is to invest in the business, both in capital expenditures, which, as you've seen by our guidance, are relatively high to our history this year; and in organically investing in operating expenses. Second is to acquire technology externally that gives us differentiated capability or accelerates us in the marketplace. That's generally license arrangements, IP acquisition, or tuck-in acquisitions.\n\nAnd we continue to look at returning cash to shareholders opportunistically, and I think that's served us well. If you look at kind of the last 18 months, we repurchased 12.6 million shares for 3 billion at an average price of $234. And we did that opportunistically in large part because it reflects kind of the stage of the company. We're relatively early in the robotics space where we look for growth, and I think that served us well.\n\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nOK. Our next question is from the line of Rick Wise, Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nRick Wise -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\n\nGood afternoon, Gary. Hello, everybody. Gary, I recently visited several European hospitals and robotic programs. And frankly and honestly, I can't be more impressed than ever with Intuitive's European commercial presence or reputation.\n\nBut I was particularly intrigued to hear one particularly high-volume robotic surgeon talk about what's next. And he seemed less focused on systems and very much focused on enabling technologies that make everything better, faster, clearer, etc. And they included things like integrated CT image overlays during procedures, that aspect of augmented reality, you know, tools that bring CT and surgery together, next-generation firefly. He was dreaming of virtual rulers, dual SureForm 45 and 60 staplers, and haptic feedback.\n\nI mean, that was a -- it was fascinating to hear. Are these the kinds of innovations that are priorities for you? And these are the kind of things you want to make docs like that excited about? Is that what you're -- the kind of stuff you're working on?\n\nGary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYou had a long list. I think several of those are important in things that we've talked about and have shared with the world. I think the idea of higher confidence, ability to identify tissue in real time for the surgeon, and we can do that a few different ways. So, the fluorescence imaging that you described and other advanced imaging technologies that give surgeons the ability to see beyond the surface of the tissue and beyond, which you can see with normal white light imaging, we absolutely think that's helping clinical outcomes.\n\nAnd we're excited about and investing in image fusion or data fusion, and that's the CT overlay, the segmentation of preoperative MRI and CT scans. And the ability to use that in real time during the case, we think, can change outcomes and change efficiency in the OR. Other types of analytic and sensing capabilities, we think, are really powerful and important. And to the earlier question about AI, machine learning, machine vision, these things work together.\n\nSo, high-definition images that show you things beyond the surface of the tissue, plus computer vision, plus AI models can give you some predictive analytics that, I think, are really powerful and would help surgeons get to better outcomes, reduce complications. So, I am like that surgeon, quite excited.\n\nRick Wise -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Just a follow-up -- quick follow-up. You, I think, if I remember correctly, took a 5% across-the-board price hike on instrumentation. And I don't know if I'm remembering correctly, that was to kick in like June 1.\n\nDid that happen? Did it help the quarter? And should I assume that it's going to be a little bit of a offset or a little bit of an instrument tailwind in the second half and beyond? Thank you, Gary.\n\nGary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Rick.\n\nJamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nIt was largely implemented in Q2, Rick. It wasn't effective at the beginning of the quarter. I'd say roughly half of the quarter benefited from the price increase. Our estimate for the impact of the price increase is consistent with what we said last quarter, roughly about $100 million impact to revenue and profit for the year.\n\nAgain, you get kind of half an impact in Q2 and the full impact in Q3 and Q4.\n\nRick Wise -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nGary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nA reminder, our motivations on that, we've been quite conservative on pricing. Our input pricing the last few years has gone up in terms of raw material and labor content. We have offset most of that through efficiency and scale advantages, but we felt like it was time to share some of that with our customers, and that was the motive behind the price increase.\n\nRick Wise -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\n\nThanks again.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go to the next line. I have a Richard of Truist Securities. Please pronounce your last name, sir.\n\nRichard Newitter -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\n\nThank you. Richard Newitter here. Thank you for taking the questions. Jamie, maybe for you on the guidance, 20% to 22%, very healthy.\n\nI'm just curious, on thinking about the low end of the range there, you specifically mentioned you contemplate, you know, bariatric surgery growth trends eroding a little bit from the 2Q levels. What's the pace of erosion there that you're thinking about that would get you to the low end? Like how much erosion? How did you establish a baseline for yourself?\n\nJamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I don't want to get too specific there, Rich, given just the relative size of bariatrics in the U.S. to our overall procedures. We can obviously see the progression between Q1 and Q2.\n\nI'd call it a moderate steady progression in the model in Q3 and Q4. The overall impact on that is obviously a function of the size of the bariatrics business for us. It's not some dramatic falloff.\n\nRichard Newitter -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\n\nOK. That's helpful. And just maybe sticking on that same topic here, bariatrics. Just thinking about the areas that you could offset that as we think of procedure categories geographically or by category that could be nearing an inflection point like bariatric got you several years ago.\n\nWhat procedure categories or geographies would you call out that you think could lead to overage there to offset any potential incremental slowdown in bariatrics, if any?\n\nJamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I'm not going to answer that in terms of overage, but I'll say where we're seeing healthy growth. If you take our largest seven markets, which is a focus for us. So, China, Japan, South Korea, Germany, France, U.K., and Italy.\n\nWhat you're seeing in those markets is generally a progression beyond urology into the next set of cancer procedures. It's market by market, but generally, that's hysterectomy, thoracic, and colorectal procedures. And we're seeing them on the early stages of an adoption curve, and that's why we've talked about our OUS business now is about half outside of urology or beyond urology. This quarter, it grew 35% in that subset.\n\nThat's consistent with what we saw in Q1. That subset also grew 35%. So, I think we're excited in those larger markets where we have that focus in continuing to drive the adoption curve in that set -- next set of procedures. If you look at market by market, you have some unique dynamics.\n\nIn China, you see liver and pancreas procedures doing well. In Japan, treatment of stomach cancer. In Korea, for example, you see thyroid. But it's really that next set of procedures.\n\nRichard Newitter -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\n\nThank you very much.\n\nGary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nJust -- I'm going to just step back a little bit on bariatrics. We've had a few questions on it, just make a point. As we go out and talk to surgeons, we talked to obesity physicians and pharmacologists, which we do in terms of our diligence, the sense here is that the market is going to adjust to the change in treatment pathway as it relates to drugs. However, it doesn't look like the drugs are a cure and may not be a fast path to cure.\n\nAnd a strong consensus among those we speak to, including people who are not surgeons, physicians who are not surgeons, is that the surgery and other interventions are going to remain an important part of the interaction. As the -- in the near term, I think the market will adjust to understand what role the drugs will play, but they're not cures. And the discontinue rate remains pretty high, and the populations of patients who don't get any benefit from the drugs also remain significant. So, I think there's an adjustment period here, and we should be aware of it.\n\nBut that may become a tailwind in future quarters as folks work through those sets of pathways and look at long-term and durable solutions into the obesity challenges.\n\nRichard Newitter -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOK. We'll go to the next line, line of Ryan Zimmerman, BTIG. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Zimmerman -- BTIG -- Analyst\n\nGood evening. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Jamie on the expense management standpoint. I mean, procedures are going up a little bit faster than expense -- or opex guidance by about a 50 basis points or so in that.\n\nAnd so, I'm just wondering, Jamie, kind of what your views are on expense management and, you know, letting some of that leverage flow through as we think about, you know, not just the back half of the year, but in the '24 versus maybe reinvesting that in R&D.\n\nJamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. For this year, we have specific objectives with respect to leverage in our enabling functions, which we've described previously, and that's a set of objectives that, I think, we intend to fulfill. Largely, what you see in the adjustments we've made to our operating expense guidance for this year is a function of our top-line performance, both in variable compensation and in the number of reps we need in the field to support a higher procedure base. For the rest of kind of the operating expense set of investments, we're holding to our -- we're largely holding to our plan for this year.\n\nWhen you project into '24, I'm not going to kind of describe the direction of where spend will go relative to procedures or revenue. We'll do that in January. But you have a couple of dynamics. We have the significant capex investments this year, 800 million to 1 billion, that will start to create incremental depreciation expense next year.\n\nA chunk of that will be in COGS and a chunk of that will be in operating expenses. So, you have kind of an operating expense headwind coming there. And those investments being largely facilities, they are planned for the medium term, meaning they're inefficient for a period until you get to full occupancy or full utilization. On the other side, we'll continue to look to leverage our enabling functions into '24.\n\nWhere that shakes out, we'll do in January because we have to complete our planning process in the back half of this year.\n\nRyan Zimmerman -- BTIG -- Analyst\n\nOK. That's very helpful. And then I noticed, and this is kind of directed at Gary and you commented on this a little earlier, but you disclosed, for the first time, I believe, the proportion of lease agreements that are usage-based versus fixed operating lease agreements. And I'm wondering, Gary, what that says and the trends that we see there about the health of your customers and what their preference is over time.\n\nGary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. It's a good question. I think we see that one size doesn't fit all. There are some folks for whom they still remain happy about capital purchases.\n\nThey see it as the cheapest way for them to access systems. They have high confidence, and they're going to buy. There are some folks for whom capital is tight or scarce and -- or they're interested in future technology protection clauses and they would rather lease. And there are some folks who are looking at expansions.\n\nThey're a little bit unsure about how fast volume might ramp. And for them, usage-based arrangements give them some protections about ramp timing and speed. Our analytical capabilities are pretty good, and our finance flexibility is pretty good. And as a result, we'll have that conversation pretty direct way.\n\nAnd I think the market starts to settle where it settles. If you ask, do we have a strong preference for one of those models? The answer is not really.\n\nJamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThe motivation, by the way, for the new disclosure was simply the rate at which those adoption of those models had grown. We felt like it was important to be transparent as to what portion of operating leases and placements that structure was. If you kind of assess all of our usage-based arrangements in aggregate life today relative to usage patterns and economic objectives, in total, on average, they're slightly above our expectations. So, they performed well so far.\n\nThat's obviously a blend across different customers and systems. Some are overperforming, some are underperforming. But I think part of the way that we've operated the program is to look carefully. Is it actually reducing barriers for accelerated growth for our customers and is it producing the economic results for us and our customers? And as we and customers have gained confidence, that's part of the reason why it's expanded the way it has.\n\nRyan Zimmerman -- BTIG -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd we'll go to the next line. We'll go to the line of Drew Ranieri, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nDrew Ranieri -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nFor squeezing me in here. Maybe just one other follow-up question on bariatrics, but maybe a different angle. I mean, we've talked to some general surgeons, too, that -- I mean, they're kind of suggesting that these new drugs might even open up potential procedure categories where these patients might not have been suited to have surgery. Gary, kind of like what are your views on this? Do you see some near-term disruption from GLP-1s on the bariatric side, but maybe this opening doors for other procedure categories? Thanks.\n\nGary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. That's a little bit of the narrative we're hearing, too. You know, we go out and canvas our customers pretty widely. There may be a role for kind of a new adjuvant use of drugs.\n\nAnd then, as you say, that may condition some patient populations to be beneficiaries of surgery downstream. There may be folks who start the drugs, get the benefits that they were hoping for. But either the side effects or the costs or the changed lifestyle that the drugs are implying make it hard to sustain. There's a fair amount of that in the literature.\n\nSo, that may -- that population may look for other solutions. I think we're just going to have to work through it and see. What we don't see yet is a magic pill, one that cures it and doesn't require behavior change or other lifestyle modification, and that -- and it seems unlikely. And as a result, I think we're going to see an adjustment.\n\nHow long that adjustment period lasts? None of us know. But we know that there will be a role for surgical and mechanical intervention after the fact, and I think we're well-positioned. And as Jamie had mentioned, it looks like even in the current environment, the share continues to move our way. So, we're going to stay close to it.\n\nDrew Ranieri -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nIs there any procedure categories that are coming up in your conversations that stand the most to benefit?\n\nGary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nIt's a good question. We're probing. Probably too soon for us to give you a definitive answer.\n\nDrew Ranieri -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nGary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nRight. That was our last question, and thank you. In closing, we continue to believe there is a substantial and durable opportunity to fundamentally improve surgery and acute interventions. Our teams continue to work closely with hospitals, physicians, and care teams in pursuit of what our customers have termed the quadruple aim: better, more predictable patient outcomes; better experiences for patients; better experiences for their care teams; and ultimately, a lower total cost to treat.\n\nWe believe value creation in surgery and acute care is foundationally human. It flows from respect for and understanding of patients and care teams, their needs, and their environment. At Intuitive, we envision a future of care that's less invasive and profoundly better, where diseases are identified earlier and treated quickly so patients can get back to what matters most. Thank you for your support on this extraordinary journey.\n\nWe look forward to talking with you again in three months.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator signoff]\n\nDuration: 0 minutes\n\nCall participants:\n\nBrian King -- Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations\n\nGary Guthart -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nJamie Samath -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nLarry Biegelsen -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\nTravis Steed -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nRobbie Marcus -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nRick Wise -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst\n\nRichard Newitter -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\n\nRyan Zimmerman -- BTIG -- Analyst\n\nDrew Ranieri -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nMore ISRG analysis\n\nAll earnings call transcripts", "tiktoken_token_count": 11250, "llama_token_count": 13456}, {"source_name": "Motley Fool", "author": "newsfeedback@fool.com (Motley Fool Transcribing)", "title": "Wells Fargo (WFC) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript", "description": "WFC earnings call for the period ending June 30, 2023.", "url": "https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/07/14/wells-fargo-wfc-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/", "text": "Wells Fargo (WFC 0.51%)\n\nQ2 2023 Earnings Call\n\n, 10:00 a.m. ET\n\nContents:\n\nPrepared Remarks\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nCall Participants\n\nPrepared Remarks:\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome, and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo second-quarter 2023 earnings conference call.

As usual, I'll make some brief comments about our second-quarter results and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second-quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some second-quarter highlights.\n\nWe had solid results in the quarter with revenue, pre-tax pre-provision profit, diluted earnings per share, and ROTCE all higher than a year ago. The revenue growth reflected strong net interest income growth, as well as higher non-interest income. While our efficiency ratio improved and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives, we had modest expense growth from a year ago. Net charge-offs have continued to increase from historical low levels, but overall credit quality was strong and consumer and business balance sheets remain healthy.\n\nWe increased our allowance for credit losses by $949 million, primarily driven by our office portfolio, as well as growth in our credit card portfolio. While we haven't seen significant losses in our office portfolio today, our detailed loan-by-loan review of the portfolio has given us a sense how the next several quarters could play out. We also considered a number of stressed scenarios, all of which informed our actions this quarter. Mike will discuss this in more detail, but I want to make the point that it is very hard to look at any one statistic and determine the risk in the portfolio.\n\nLoss content will be driven by a combination of factors including but not limited to: property type, location, lease rates, lease renewal notice states, loan structure, and borrower behavior. Most importantly, our CRE teams remain focused on working with our clients for its portfolio surveillance and derisking to minimize loss content. Both commercial and consumer average loans were up from a year ago but were down from the first quarter as the economy has slowed, and we've taken some credit taking actions. Credit card spending remains strong, but the rate of growth has slowed from the outsized growth rates we saw for 2022.\n\nDebit card spending was flat from a year ago, with growth in discretionary spend, offset by declines in nondiscretionary spends. Average deposits were down from the first quarter, driven by lower consumer deposits, while the decline in commercial deposits slowed. Now, let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work. Regulatory pressure on banks with long-standing issues such as ours continues to grow, and as such, our continued intensive effort to complete the build-out of an appropriate risk and control framework for a company of our size and complexity is critical.\n\nI continue to emphasize that this is our top priority and will remain so. And that while we have implemented substantial portions of the work required, we have more implementation to do, as well as work to make sure the changes operate effectively over time. As I said before, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions until the work is complete. While we're devoting all necessary resources to our risk and control work, we're also continuing to invest in our business to better serve our customers and help drive growth.\n\nOur consumer customers have continued to increase their use of our mobile app. We added over 1 million mobile active customers over the past year, and mobile logins increased 9% from a year ago. Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant is now live on our mobile app for all consumer customers. Since launching at the end of April, our customers have interacted with Fargo over 4 million times.\n\nWe've continued to make important hires, bringing new expertise to Wells Fargo in businesses we are looking to grow. We named Barry Simmons as the new head of national sales and wealth and investment management. It will be critical in our efforts to better serve clients and help advisors grow their business. We also continued to attract veteran bankers in corporate and investment banking, hiring new managing directors in our banking division in priority growth areas, including a co-head of global mergers and acquisitions, co-head of financial institutions, and new heads of financial sponsors, equity capital markets, healthcare, and technology, media, and telecom.\n\nWe also continue to focus on better serving our communities. We announced a 10-year strategic partnership with TD JX Group that could result in up to $1 billion in capital and financing from Wells Fargo to drive economic vitality and inclusivity in communities across America. The Wells Fargo Foundation were at $7.5 million to Habitat for Humanity to build and repair more than 360 homes nationwide. We've worked with Habitat for Humanity for nearly three decades and donated more than $129 million since 2010.\n\nWells Fargo signed on as the first anchor funder of UnidosUS HOME initiative to create 4 million new Latino homeowners by 2030. We provided the initial grants to start a fund launched by fintech Hello Alice to improve access to credit and capital for small business owners who are members of underserved groups, including women. We continue to open hope inside centers on Wells Fargo branches, including six during the first half of 2023, with plans to reach 20 markets by the end of this year. The centers help empower community members to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching.\n\nWe published our 2023 diversity, equity, and inclusion report, which highlights the progress we've made in our DE&I strategy and initiatives both inside our company and the communities where we live and work. However, we have more work to do to achieve enduring results that will require for long-term commitments. Looking ahead, the U.S. economy continues to perform better than many expected.\n\nAnd although there will likely be continued economic slowing and uncertainty remains, it is quite possible the range of scenarios will narrow over the next few quarters. This year's Federal Reserve stress test affirmed that we remain in a strong capital position, reflecting the value of our franchise and benefits of our operating model. This capital strength allows us to serve our customers' financial needs while continuing to prudently return excess capital to our shareholders. As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third-quarter common stock dividend by 17% to $0.35 per share, subject to approval by the company's board of directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month.\n\nWe've repurchased $8 billion of common stock during the first half of this year and the stress test results demonstrated that we have the capacity to continue to repurchase common stock. Regulators have signaled that the Basel III endgame proposal, which could be out as soon as this summer, will include higher capital requirements that would be skewed to the country's largest banks. While there's some speculation that capital requirements could increase by 20%, we don't know what the impact will be to Wells Fargo, however, we do expect our capital requirements will increase. While any changes to regulatory capital requirements are expected to be phased in gradually over several years, we are considering the potential impact in contemplating the amount of our future repurchases.\n\nOur balance sheet is strong. We've increased and remained focused on increasing our earnings capacity and continue to like our competitive position. We remain prepared for a variety of scenarios and our steadfast commitment to our risk and control build-out, coupled with our continued focus on financial and credit risk management allows us to support our customers throughout economic cycles. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was 4.9 billion or $1.25 per diluted common share, both up from a year ago, reflecting the progress we are making on improving our performance, which I'll highlight throughout the call. Starting with capital liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.7%, down approximately 10 basis points from the first quarter.\n\nDuring the second quarter, we repurchased 4 billion in common stock, and as Charlie highlighted, subject to board approval, we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the third quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 1.5 percentage points above our current regulatory minimum plus buffers and was 1.8 percentage points above our expected new regulatory minimum plus buffer starting in the fourth quarter of this year. While we expect to repurchase more common stock this year, we believe continuing to maintain significant excess capital is appropriate until there is more clarity on the new capital requirements that Charlie highlighted. Our liquidity position remains strong in the second quarter with our liquidity coverage ratio approximately 23 percentage points above the regulatory minimum.\n\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. Overall, credit quality remained strong, but as expected, net loan charge-offs continue to increase from historically low levels and were 32 basis points of average loans in the second quarter. Commercial net loan charge-offs increased 137 million from the first quarter to 15 basis points of average loans. Approximately half of the increase was in commercial banking where the losses were borrower-specific with little signs of systematic weakness across the portfolio.\n\nThe rest of the increase was driven by higher losses in commercial real estate, primarily in the office portfolio. I'll share some more details on the CRE office exposure on the next slide. Consumer net loan charge-offs increased modestly, up 23 million from the first quarter to 58 basis points of average loans. The increase primarily came from the credit card portfolio as residential mortgage loans continue to have net recoveries and auto losses declined.\n\nWhile consumer credit performance remained solid overall, and we've continued to take incremental credit exciting actions across the portfolios, we expect consumer net loan charge-offs will continue to gradually increase. Nonperforming assets increased 14% from the first quarter as lower nonaccrual loans across the consumer portfolios were more than offset by higher commercial nonaccrual loans, primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses increased 949 million in the second quarter, primarily from commercial real estate office loans, as well as for higher credit card balances. We've updated Slide 6, which highlights our commercial real estate portfolio.\n\nWe had 154.3 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the second quarter with 33.1 billion of office loans, which were down modestly from the first quarter and represented 3% of our total loans outstanding. The office market continues to be weak and the composition of our office portfolio is relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the first quarter. As Charlie mentioned, our CRE teams are focused on surveillance and derisking, which includes reducing exposures and closely monitoring at-risk loans. This quarter, we added a table to this slide that breaks down our CRE office exposure in the context of our broader CRE portfolio.\n\nAs the slide shows, our office loans at the end of the second quarter were primarily in corporate investment banking and that is also where we had the most nonaccrual loans in the highest level of allowance for credit losses. Last quarter, we disclosed for the first time the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for the office portfolio in the corporate investment bank, which increased from 5.7% at the end of the first quarter to 8.8% at the end of the second quarter. This quarter, we are also providing our allowance for credit losses for our total CRE office portfolio, which was 6.6% at the end of the second quarter, up from 4.4% at the end of the first quarter. As we've highlighted last quarter, we're providing this data to give you more insight into the portfolio, but each property situation is different, and there are many variables that can determine performance, which is why we regularly review this portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis.\n\nFor example, we have properties that are experiencing increased vacancies where borrowers have decided to inject equity and make investments to improve the property even in cities with more difficult fundamentals. We also have properties that are well leased to performing, but borrowers need health refinancing. In those situations, we are working with farmers to restructure, which in many cases, include some paydown of the balance. There are also situations that result in a sale or work out of the asset.\n\nWe will continue to closely monitor this portfolio, but as has been the case in prior cycles, this will likely play out over an extended period of time as we actively work with borrowers to help resolve issues that they may be facing. On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were relatively stable in the first quarter and were up 2% from a year ago, driven by higher commercial and industrial loans and commercial banking and credit card loans. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results.\n\nAverage loan yields increased 247 basis points from a year ago and 30 basis points from the first quarter due to the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 7% from a year ago, predominantly driven by deposit outflows in our consumer wealth businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives. While down from a year ago, average commercial deposits were relatively stable from the first quarter, and average deposits grew in corporate loan investment banking. As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase up 30 basis points from the first quarter to 113 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to the rising interest rates.\n\nOur mix of noninterest-bearing deposits declined from 32% in the first quarter to 30% in the second quarter but remained above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to net interest income on Slide 8. Second-quarter net interest income was 13.2 billion, up 29% from a year ago as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $173 million decline from the first quarter was primarily due to lower deposit balances, partially offset by one additional day in the quarter.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, we expected full-year net interest income to grow by approximately 10% compared with 2022. We currently expect full year 2023 net interest income to increase approximately 14% compared with 2022. There are a variety of factors that we've considered in our expectations for the rest of the year. We are assuming modest growth in loans with some additional deposit outflows and migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits, as well as continued deposit repricing, including competitive pricing on commercial deposits.\n\nAdditionally, we are using recent -- the recent rate curve, which is shown on the slide. As a reminder, many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain, and we will need to see how each of these assumptions plays out during the remainder of the year. Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense grew 125 million or 1% from a year ago.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, we expected our full year 2023 noninterest expense, excluding operating losses, to be approximately 50.2 billion. We currently expect our full year 2023 noninterest expense, excluding operating losses to be approximately 51 billion. The increase includes higher severance expense due to actions we have taken in the plan -- and plan to take in 2023 as attrition has been slower than expected. Of note, we've reduced headcount each quarter since the third quarter of 2020 and headcount declined 1% from the first quarter and 4% from a year ago.\n\nAs a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses. Turning to our operating segments, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 10. Consumer and small business banking revenue increased 19% from a year ago as higher net interest income, driven by the impact of higher interest rates, was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year. We continue to reduce the underlying cost to run the business as customers migrate to digital, including mobile.\n\nWe've reduced our number of branches by 4% and branch staffing by 10% from a year ago. Home lending revenue declined 13% from a year ago, driven by the lower net interest income due to loan spread compression and lower mortgage originations. We continue to reduce headcount in the second quarter, down 37% from a year ago, and we expect that staffing levels will further decline during the second half of the year. Credit card revenue increased 1% from a year ago due to higher loan balances.\n\nPayment rates were down for a year ago, but have been stable over the last 3 quarters and remained above pre-pandemic levels. New account growth remained strong, up 17% from a year ago, and importantly, the quality of the new accounts continue to be better than what we were booking historically. Auto revenue declined 13% from a year ago, driven by the continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue was up 17% from a year ago due to higher loan balances.\n\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 77% from a year ago and increased 18% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality. We funded our last correspondent loan in the second quarter with our current focus being serving our bank customers, as well as borrowers in minority communities. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for five consecutive quarters and balances were down 7% at the end of the second quarter compared to a year ago.\n\nOrigination volume declined 11% from a year ago, reflecting credit-tightening actions, as well as continued price competition. As Charlie highlighted, debit card spend was flat in the second quarter compared to a year ago, spending on fuel due to lower gas prices, home improvement and travel at the largest declines compared to last year. Credit card spending continued to be strong and was up 13% from a year ago. Growth rates were stable throughout the second quarter with fuel the only category down year over year.\n\nTurning to commercial banking results on Slide 12. The middle market banking revenue increased 51% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 13% year over year, primarily due to higher loan balances. Average loan balances were up 12% in the second quarter compared to a year ago, driven by new customer growth and higher line utilization.\n\nAverage loan balances have grown for eight consecutive quarters and the pace of growth has slowed. Average loans were up 1% from the first quarter with loan growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by seasonally higher inventory levels, while middle market banking loans were flat. Turning to corporate investment banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 37% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher lending revenue.\n\nThe growth in investment banking fees from a year ago reflected write-downs taken in the second quarter of 2022 on an unfunded leveraged finance movements. Commercial real estate revenue grew 26% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Markets revenue increased 29% from a year ago, driven by the higher trading results across most asset classes. Our strong trading results during the first half of the year were driven by underlying market conditions and also reflected the benefit of our investments in technology and talent, which have allowed us to broaden our client franchise and generate more trading flows.\n\nAverage loans were down 2% from a year ago and 1% from the first quarter. The decline in the first quarter was driven by banking, reflecting a combination of slow demand and modestly lower line utilization. On Slide 14, wealth and investment management revenue was down 2% compared to a year ago, driven by a decline in asset-based fees due to lower market valuations. Growth in net interest income from a year ago was driven by the impact of higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives.\n\nHowever, outflows into cash alternatives slowed in the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of win advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so second-quarter results reflected the market valuations as of April 1st, which were down from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the third quarter will reflect higher market valuations as of July 1st. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago, primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending.\n\nNow, Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. Revenue increased 751 million from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and lower impairments of equity securities in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. In summary, our results in the second quarter reflected continued improvement in our earnings capacity. We grew revenue and had strong growth in pre-tax provision profit.\n\nAs expected, our net charge-offs continue to slowly increase from historical lows, and our allowance for credit losses increased. We are slowly -- we are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit-tightening actions where we believe appropriate. Our capital levels remain strong and we continue to repurchase common stock. We will now take your questions.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please stand by for our first question. Our first question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.\n\nYour line is open, sir. Mr. Usdin, please check the mute button on your phone.\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWhy don't we take another one, and then we'll come back to Ken?\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. The next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\n\nMorning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Hey, it was great to see the higher NII guide and the performance this quarter. That said, it seems likely the dollars of NII will come down from here.\n\nI guess, just broadly speaking, are you able to chat about what factors might be most important and just sort of your ability to arrest a downward move in NII? In other words, kind of when and why would it end up flattening out if we're ideally getting close to the end of a fed-tightening cycle.\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. Thanks, Scott. It's Mike. I'll take that, and Charlie can jump in if he wants.\n\nWhen you look at the assumptions and the -- that underpin that, and I highlighted some of this in my script, but I'll kind of go back through them. We've got a little bit of modest loan growth in there. So, that's not a big driver of sort of what we're seeing. And I think you're probably seeing that from others where we're just not seeing that same demand that we saw a year or so ago on sort of on loans.\n\nWe're also assuming that we'll see some additional outflows, particularly in the consumer space as people continue to spend money. And then, we'll see some more migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits. And then, deposit pricing will -- betas will evolve over time. I think it's still very competitive on the commercial side, and I think that will continue on the consumer side that will evolve.\n\nSo, I think you got to look at those combination of factors and make some assumptions around when you think they start to stabilize. And -- but I think we're assuming that those trends that we've been seeing now for the last couple of quarters will continue at least through the year-end.\n\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\n\nOK. Perfect. And maybe if we could drill down into one of those in particular, just the migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing. They've come down but still above pre-pandemic levels, I believe.\n\nDo you have a sense for where and why those would start to settle out?\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I mean, there's a few factors underneath that. As you pointed out, we're about 30% at the end of the quarter, down from about 32, I think the prior quarter. And if you go back pre-COVID, they were in kind of the mid-20s, mid to upper 20s, depending on when exactly when you look at it.\n\nSo, -- so -- and we've been trending downward. Part of that is excess deposits on the commercial side. As people use up their earnings credits for the fees they're paying, you're seeing some migration there. That stabilizes.\n\nAnd then, you've seen, again, on the consumer side, people spending from their primary checking accounts. So, those are the factors that I look at on when that starts to slow down and stabilize, but it's been pretty consistent, at least for the last quarter or two.\n\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\n\nOK. All right. Thank you very much, Mike.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nHey, good morning. So, Mike, thanks for the details on the CRE book. I think Charlie mentioned that you've gone through loan by loan in identifying. And I appreciate the desynchratic nature of every sort of CRE loan.\n\nBut given the reserve you've taken this quarter, give us a sense of your visibility around how well deserved the bank is today knowing what we know in terms of the macro outlook. And also, if you can comment on just the rest of the CRE book, particularly as it relates to San Francisco or California and your level of comfort around just apartments, etc. within that market. Thank you.\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, thanks. I'll take that. It's Mike. Broadly, I'll start on the broader point on CRE, and I'll come back to office.\n\nI think we've gone through the multifamily portfolio in quite a lot of detail. And I think -- I'm talking about the broader portfolio first, right? And so, you talked about apartments in some cities. And so, I think when you look at the broader portfolio, including multifamily, it's all performing quite well. And I think you've seen certainly a slowing of growth rates in rents, but they're not declining in most cases.\n\nYou're seeing good occupancy rates in many of the new construction that's coming online. And so, overall, it feels quite constructive still for multifamily. And that same theme really applies to the rest of the portfolio. On office, that's the place where we're certainly seeing weakness.\n\nAnd as you think about the allowance we put up, we do have some very specific borrower loan level estimates of what we think could play out over the next quarter -- next couple -- next few quarters, and that's embedded in the allowance. And then, as you look at the rest of the office portfolio, we've gone through a number of stress scenarios and feel like at this point, we're appropriately reserved to be able to deal with what could be a number of different scenarios depending on how it plays out over time.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nGot it. And I guess just a separate question. I mean, you obviously have ample capital. Just, Charlie, from your standpoint, how impactful is the asset cap today? Given the squeeze on the rest of the industry, I would think Wells would actually be gaining market share.\n\nBut is the asset cap and all the regulatory issues, I'm not going to ask you to give us a timeline, but is that still a meaningful challenge in terms of your ability to take market share?\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, I mean, you can look at the size of our balance sheet and see where it is relative to the asset cap, which is 1.952 trillion, I think.\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThat's the asset cap.\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYep. That's the actual cap, remember, which is a daily average over a couple of quarters. So, relative to where we're operating today, we feel like we still have plenty of balance sheet to serve our customers. And it's not standing in the way of that hasn't always been the case, but I think that's where we are today.\n\nBut putting just the pure economics of the asset cap aside, it is something that when we look at the work we have to get done, the fact that it's there is a statement of the reality that we still have more work to do. And so, it's critical that we continue on our road to complete that work. And so, that's the way we're thinking about it today.\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nAnd maybe I'll just add one thing. When you look at some of the growth opportunities we have, Charlie highlighted some of the investment banking hires we're making. In large part, we already have the exposure out to the client base there. So, now it's about making sure we've got the right people to go after the fee opportunity, not necessarily extending a lot more balance sheet, wealth management and the growth opportunity there, same theme.\n\nAnd even in the card space, as we look at the refresh product line is doing really well. We've got more to come there. And I think we've got plenty of room to continue to support many of the growth opportunities we have even if we didn't put out more -- have more exposure to support it.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nGood color. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\n\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nGood morning.\n\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\n\nSo, I wanted to start off with a question just on the NII outlook. Certainly encouraging to see the guidance increase. But you noted, Mike, that it does contemplate a modest level of loan growth. And just parsing some of your other comments where you alluded to credit tightening, signs of slowdown in the broader economy, what gives you confidence around some inflection in lending activity, especially given the flattish loan growth that we've seen this quarter?\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. Well, I think we're seeing -- we're certainly seeing growth in card. So, I think we would expect that to continue. And then, in the rest of the portfolios, we see a little bit of growth in the asset-based lending and leasing business in the commercial bank.\n\nMiddle market is kind of flat, at least this quarter, and then you can see the consumer items. So, I think we're hopeful that we'll see some growth as we go into the second quarter. But as always, Steven, what we try to do with guidance is give you guidance that it doesn't necessarily require every assumption to go in our favor. So, the bigger drivers of uncertainty around NII for the rest of the year continue to be the same ones we've been talking about now for the last couple of quarters.\n\nIt's really going to be deposits and deposit pricing. The loan story will matter, but not anywhere near to the same degree.\n\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\n\nNo, it's helpful color. And just a follow-up on expense. You cited the headcount reductions and higher severance costs driving some upward pressure this year. But just wanted to better understand how we should be thinking about the exit rate on expense once the headcount actions that you cited are fully captured in the run rate, and whether there's any plans to maybe redeploy some of the NII windfall to reinvest back in the business as we think about some of the potential benefits and the higher NII guidance you cited.\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I think our focus on expenses really hasn't changed over the last quarter or two. As we've talked about now for a while, we're going to continue to be very disciplined around the expense base. I think we're very much focused on making sure we execute and achieve the efficiencies that we've talked about.\n\nAnd as we get to year-end, we'll sort of look at and after we do our work around the budget for next year, we'll go back through all the ups and downs like we normally do and give you some perspective there. But really the thinking around it hasn't changed.\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nAnd let me just add, if it's OK. I think when we laid out our expense guidance, we got a series of questions about how we think of the variability of that number and the environment and will the rest of our results impact that number. And I think as we look at how we're performing, I think we -- it wouldn't be hard for us to make a bunch of decisions to hit an expense number. But to the point is, we -- our results have been relatively strong, and so, we are doing a series of things.\n\nI don't think about it as onetime expenses, but we have -- there is a fair amount of subjective expenses that relate to business development, product enhancements, and things like that that we do have the ability to each year, each quarter, look at how we're performing and decide how much we want to spend. And so, as we look forward, I think we're going to wait and see as we go through our budgeting process, and we do a series of scenarios in terms of how things could play out next year and then make that determination. But as Mike said, I think we do separate out the fact that we continue to believe that there are continued opportunities to drive efficiency throughout the company. We're not going to lose sight of that.\n\nAnd that is separate from how much do we want to spend away from that. And we'll talk more about that toward the end of the year.\n\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\n\nHelpful color. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.\n\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\nGood morning. Wanted to see if we can get some of your updated thoughts on buybacks here. CET1, 10.7% and you indicated the 4 billion buyback in 2Q, when you expect to continue to buyback from here. But obviously, Basel III end game is a factor.\n\nAnd I heard you on that you're contemplating buybacks as you look out from here. So, could you maybe help frame that for us what that could mean in terms of the pace of repurchases? Thanks.\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nNot really any more than -- I think that's -- I think what we said is as much clarity as we want to give at this time. I think we are -- we have substantial excess capital above the regulatory requirements and regulatory buffers and on top of the level of buffers that we have talked about running at. And so, we think that's prudent given the fact that it's likely that capital requirements are going up. But the reality to answer the -- just in terms of the timing and in terms of the ability to answer the question, from everything that we read is the same thing that you read, it's likely that we will learn later this month or early next month exactly what the proposal is.\n\nAnd based upon that, it will help us inform exactly how much room we have for buybacks. But there are most of the scenarios that we see, there is room for us to continue the buyback program in a prudent way and still build the required capital to whatever levels we'd have to require -- to be required to build a math and keep the kind of buffers that we want to keep. So, there are a bunch of moving pieces here. And so it's just -- it doesn't make sense to put any more numbers on it until we actually see what those proposals are.\n\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\nOK. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, separately, on the NII side, again, I appreciate the updated guide for '23 of the 14%.\n\nMaybe can you talk about when you look at the forward curves, what could be the forward curve implications for NII as you look further out into 2024? If we do reach a Fed funds of around 4% implied by the forward curve, how much of a headwind to NII could that be for you? And maybe also if you could just talk about the near-term deposit trajectory? I know you mentioned still continued decline. I don't know if you can help frame that, size it up. Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, John. I'm not going to give you much clarity on 2024. But I think the things you should think about, obviously, are going to be as rate -- on the commercial side, rate -- betas on the way up are pretty high, betas on the way down are pretty high. And the consumer side really hasn't moved much at this point.\n\nAnd so, I do -- you sort of have to go into your modeling, looking at each of the components a little bit differently. And as we -- and I think many others have talked about over time, like once rates peak, there is likely some lag of continued repricing for a while after rates peak. And so, you've got to think about all of -- all of how that goes in your model. And then, I think as I said in my script, I think we've seen pretty consistent performance across deposits over the last couple of quarters.\n\nAnd we're not seeing big shifts in behavior at this point. And so, we'll see how that goes over the coming quarters. But -- but there's still a lot of uncertainty in the assumption set that you go through that you have here. And so, you got to make your best judgment on what you think is going to happen.\n\nBut as you get closer to the end of the right cycle, you've probably seen a lot of the mix shift and repricing happening already. And so, we'll see how that goes.\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nCan I just add even just more broadly, just to be clear about, we don't -- we're not looking specifically at giving guidance in terms of 2024 yet. But at the same time, just more broadly speaking, we are and have been out earning an NII. And we've been very clear about that as we talk about getting toward our 15% ROTCE targets. It's in a more normalized environment.\n\nBut at the same time, there are a series of things that we expect to be able to do as we look forward. A big part of it is growing the fees in the business, as Mike spoke about. We're not constrained by the asset cap. They're in our existing businesses and a lot of the things that we're doing, whether it's in our wealth business, whether it's in the card business, whether it's in the corporate investment bank, or middle market as well.\n\nWe do expect to see the fruits of that labor. At the same time, we continue to stay very focused on expenses. And then, the other thing I would just remind everyone is there's lots of conversations around charge-offs and things like that. But remember, we are all required when we think about CECL to be as forward-looking as we possibly can.\n\nYou all know how we come up with the different scenarios. And so, the level of reserving that's been running through our P&L, I think this is the fifth consecutive quarter we've added to reserves, which is what's impacting the EPS of the company, has been based upon an environment which, at some point, will be very different than what the expectation is sitting here. So, I think to add all those things together, and I just think it's important to think about all those things as opposed to just NII itself. Next question, operator.\n\nOperator\n\nCertainly. We'll move on to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nHey, Betsy.\n\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nJust two follow-ups. One on the reserve build in commercial real estate that I know you discussed a bit already. I just wanted to understand how much of that was coming from really California. We all know there was a property that traded on California Street that sold at a discount.\n\nSo, I'm just wondering how much of it is California office versus anything more broader based beyond that? Thanks.\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, Betsy. It's not isolated to California. I mean, I think you see weakness in a lot of cities these days, and it really comes down to property-specific stuff. And even in California, we've got as many examples where clients are actually reinvesting in buildings, even if lease rates are low or even empty in some cases, as they are going into it a workout.\n\nSo, I think it really depends on building borrower and all the things we sort of talked about in the script, and it's less focused on just California.\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. And I just want to reemphasize what Mike is saying, and we talked about this in the prepared remarks, which is we have all spent a bunch of time going through a very detailed review of the office portfolio. Just the other day, we went through just a whole series of things that we're seeing. And I just really want to make the point, which I said in my script, it's not -- there's -- it's a very big mistake to think about loss content by looking at just where the property is.\n\nAgain, we have examples in cities that are struggling where the structure of our loan is quite good. The underlying property has very high lease rates for an extended period of time. And then, we can have a loan in a market which is doing well. But for whatever reason that property is a specific issue in that property, there are a bunch of potential termination dates in the shorter term.\n\nAnd so, that's the level of detail that we've used to look at to come up with what we think the appropriate level of reserving is. And I think we've tried to be as diligent as we can in stressing the scenarios that we see play itself out, so that when we look at ourselves and we understand what CECL reserving requires us to do, that's what we're trying to accomplish.\n\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nSo, would you -- and I think we all know like for the most part, commercial real estate loans are bullets, right, where the stress comes at the role. And I guess I'm wondering, is this reserve add reflecting the entirety of the CRE book for that entirety of roll rate risk? Or is this like a two-year forward? And part of the reason for asking the question is trying to understand if there's -- how much risk there is for further increases in CRE-related reserve builds?\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Mike, I'll start, and then you either chime in or give your opinion. We have tried to take into account all of the risks including refinance risk that exists in the portfolios, looking at the current rate environment, cap rate expectations and things like that. Is it possible that we have to add something in the future because we learn more as time goes on, we would never say no? But again, what we're trying to do is be holistic in the review of the portfolio based upon everything that we know.\n\nAnd just as you can imagine, when we sit in the room with the people that run the real estate business and all the risk people, there's a range of opinion. There are people in there that say, we just -- it's hard to see losing this amount of money based upon what that individual thinks all of the underlying assumptions will play themselves out as. And then, there are others where we say we actually want to stress the scenario because it is possible, and we have to give a weighting to that. And -- so that's how we come up with what this is.\n\nBut again, we're trying to -- again, I don't have -- just -- we're trying to be forward-looking. We're trying to be holistic in all the risks that exist. And part of the reason to show you those -- that additional disclosure we made is so you can see exactly where the issues are relative to the rest of the office portfolio and the rest of the CRE and isolate just the level of reserving that exists, which is, at this point, is substantial.\n\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nGot it. I understand. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nThank you. Good morning, guys. Mike, can you share with us, you touched on this a little bit in response to one of the earlier questions. But when you guys are looking at your balance sheet and you're measuring your treasury functions on your assets and liabilities, can you share with us what you're thinking for the second half of the year or into next year in terms of how you're managing that? And how that may be different than what -- how you position the balance sheet a year ago.\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, Gerard. Sure. It's not that different, right? On the margin, you may be making decisions to add a little duration here or there, but I'd say it's marginal at this point. And we really haven't changed substantially how the balance sheet is positioned.\n\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nVery good. And then, just a follow-up. I know you guys have given some good details here on working through the commercial real estate portfolio. And, Mike, I think you said in your prepared remarks in some cases, you've been able to get additional payments or equity investments from your borrowers to cure maybe a potential problem.\n\nCan you share with us some of the other workout solutions you're using so you can get through this period of adjustment that we're seeing in commercial real estate?\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I mean, sure. It's -- there's plenty of little structural enhancements you can make to feel better about it. And then there are also in a lot of cases, getting some partial paydowns.\n\nAnd then, you look at and you're trading those for refinancing in term. And I think you give people a little bit more time to work through these sets of issues. I think we try really hard not to punt issues down the road. And so, if there are real issues that we need to deal with, we try to deal with them in a moment.\n\nBut there are a number of structural enhancements that we sort of work on with borrowers to get ourselves comfortable that we're setting the loan up for success.\n\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nVery good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on how you're interpreting the OCC and Fed joint statement that they put out on June 29th, encouraging lenders to find short-term or temporary loan accommodation solutions for their borrowers. Is that really anything new? Is that just standard operating procedure that they're reiterating? Or can this sort of help provide solutions that would allow you to work with your borrowers and perhaps delay classification, deterioration of classification or classification to TDR?\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, it's Mike. I'll take that. Well, TDR doesn't exist anymore, but that classification. But the guidance is very similar to what was issued originally back, I think in 2009, hasn't really changed much and doesn't really change the way we've been interacting with our borrowers already in terms of really being proactive to work with them to find solutions to help them work through what could be difficult circumstances in some cases.\n\nSo, -- and it doesn't give you any leeway for how you classify criticized loans or other classification. So, the intent is really to just be clear that people should continue to work with borrowers to find solutions, which is what we do all the time anyway.\n\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nGot it. And just a follow-up question here. Thank you for the disclosure again on Slide 6. With 22 billion of your loans in CIB, I think investors are wondering what is the average loan size there?\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. I don't think that's something we give. And it's a wide range. Averages sometimes are very misleading.\n\nAnd so there's a wide range. And what really matters is not the loan size. It really matters -- it will merely matters for all the variables Charlie talked about earlier in terms of what's happening with that property. So, I think that would be -- I think I would focus there.\n\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nGot it. And just squeezing in one more question. And before I ask this expense question, Charlie, I think your investors very much appreciate it that you're not just doing whatever you can to hit an expense number, and you're reinvesting back into the company. So, to that end, I'm wondering if -- have you disclosed how much of the 800 million increase in the outlook for this year has to do with the severance?\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nWe didn't give an exact number, but that is, by far, the single largest piece of it, that's part of it. And there's some other exit costs for properties as we exit some lease space and other things. But that -- the severance is by far the largest piece.\n\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\nGood morning. I want to follow up, Charlie, on some of your prepared remarks. You talked about there's still some things that you're implementing to address regulatory issues. And wondering if you could give a couple of examples of what still needs to be done in terms of implementation and when you expect that to be completed.\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nListen, I think as we've said, there's a lot of work to do. It is multiyears worth of deliverables. What we've -- what I've said is that we have implemented a lot, but we still have more to do. And I -- but I say that I just want to be clear, I'm speaking in -- everyone generally thinks I'm speaking about one of the consent orders, which has the asset cap.\n\nWe're thinking about all of the work that we have to do related to all the consent orders and the work to build the control environment. And there is a lot getting done. But ultimately, what matters, you don't get an A for effort, in this. It's about getting things over the finish line on time and getting them done to the -- with the quality that our regulators and we expect from each other.\n\nAnd so -- as you know, we've been very careful not to put dates out there because we have to do our work and then our regulators have to take a look at it and see if it's done to their satisfaction. We don't want to get ahead of that process, but we continue to move forward.\n\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\nAnd I understand that you can't speak for them signing off on what you've done. But in terms of you accomplishing what you want to accomplish, where are you on that kind of process like whether you want to frame it from an innings perspective or a percent basis. Any way to frame that acknowledging there's a lot to do and that you've done a lot, but how far along are you in terms of what you can control on implementing your things?\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. No, listen, I appreciate the -- your desire to have me answer those questions. But again, all that matter, it does -- our view of accomplishing the work doesn't matter. What matters is that our regulators look at it and save them to their satisfaction.\n\nSo, I really don't think it's helpful or productive to go beyond what I've said at this point. But again, I do understand and appreciate why you're asking.\n\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\nUnderstood. Fair enough. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thanks. A quick one. Mike or Charlie, can you give us the maturity schedule, what percentage or amount of your office CRE loans are maturing in the second half and into 2024?\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nNot specifically, Vivek. We don't disclose that, but you should assume these are standard course loans in the commercial real estate space, which are generally three- to five-year loans.\n\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nOK. And you haven't really been originating much in the last couple of years. So, I guess we could go back to looking at when did you slow down the origination of new office CRE, Mike? Was it two years ago? Was it three? Any color on that?\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah. Look, I think you have to remember that we've been refinancing existing facilities along that time period. So, -- but I think if you take the portfolio and assume some kind of basic average life based on what I said, I think you'll get a pretty good sense of the approximate maturity schedule.\n\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nOK. And how about multifamily? What's the average life of those loans and maturities there? I recognize your comment -- I heard your comments that those are in a much better position given all the factors you already cited.\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nSlightly longer -- a few years longer than office.\n\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nOK. All right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our final question for today's call will come from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. Your line is open, sir.\n\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\n\nGood morning. Most of my questions were already asked and answered. But just I wanted to follow up on the consent order issues. If I recall correctly, and please correct me if I'm wrong, there's six consent orders remaining and three of them I remember, deals somewhat with the mortgage banking operation.\n\nAnd I know starting last fall, you started the planning effort to simplify and downsize that. And you've been executing on that this year. Can you give us a sense of what it is you need to do in mortgage banking related to those consent orders?\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nYeah, sure. It's Mike. So, first of all, there are nine public consent orders out there that are all there, so you can see those. The -- when you look at the mortgage ones, I think that each of the consent orders is actually quite clear in terms of what needs to happen to satisfy those.\n\nSo, I would just point you back to the documents themselves, which can give you a pretty good sense of what it is, and each one is a little bit different.\n\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\n\nFollow-up then. Do you talk to the regulators about the progress you're making in mortgage banking on a monthly basis or quarterly basis semiannual? Or do you present something at the end? How does the interaction with regulators go?\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nWe talk to our regulators all the time at all parts of the company at all levels of the company. And so, you should assume we're actively engaged consistently with our regulators all the time. But the only thing I would add to that is -- but again, they're here, they're on site. We talk to them literally all the time.\n\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\n\nRight. No, I understand that. But specifically related to the progress you're making.\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nI know. Just give me a second. We talk to them about everything. And given the importance of the consent orders, you can assume it's about the work that's going on in the underlying consent order.\n\nBut having said all of that, what matters is the work that they do at the end of the consent order after we submitted to them. And so, they can be up to speed on what we're doing. They can know how we feel about the progress that we're making. But at the -- but when we submit a consent order to them, they come in and do their holistic review.\n\nAnd so, that's really where their determination is made about whether or not it's done to their satisfaction. So, again, that just gets to the reason why I want to be very careful about not drawing any conclusions from our view on our work or any interim comments we might get from them. What really matters is the holistic review that they do and the process that they go through internally in the regulatory organizations.\n\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\n\nSo, that was part of my first question. Have you submitted anything yet on mortgage banking?\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWe're not going to talk about that. I've said that over and over and over again.\n\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nOK. Thank you very much, everyone. We appreciate the time, and we'll talk to you all soon.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator signoff]\n\nDuration: 0 minutes\n\nCall participants:\n\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\n\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\n\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\n\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\n\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\n\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\n\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\n\nMore WFC analysis\n\nAll earnings call transcripts", "tiktoken_token_count": 12736, "llama_token_count": 14896}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Vanessa Thorpe Arts and media correspondent", "title": "Hollywood actors\u2019 strike: entertainment desert looms and pain will spread wider", "description": "The walkout by writers and screen stars won\u2019t affect just the US film industry but production in UK and EuropeThere will be no fresh helpings of The White Lotus, The Last of Us or even Emily in Paris beaming into front rooms when summer fades.

Nor will a screen version of the musical Wicked, starring Ariana Grande, be showing in your local cinema in the spring. And all shooting on Gladiator 2 in Morocco is likely to be indefinitely paused. Already, the wails are almost audible.\n\nOn this, the first weekend of the American screen actors\u2019 strike, the level of frustration registered by film and TV drama fans around the world has dwarfed earlier reactions to the equivalent writers\u2019 strike, running since the beginning of May.\n\nSince negotiations collapsed in Los Angeles on Thursday, the gloves are off in a fight over the way the streaming services are seen to be pushing down pay and investing in the use of artificial intelligence in production.\n\nAnd if an industrial relations struggle benefits from a dose of charisma, then the battle to secure the income of the talent behind a large proportion of the world\u2019s streaming content suddenly has much more of the right ingredient. On Friday, George Clooney became the latest celebrity to back the campaign. \u201cActors and writers in large numbers have lost their ability to make a living,\u201d the actor said, going on to speak of \u201can inflection point in our industry\u201d.\n\nActor Rosario Dawson on the SAG picket line in Los Angeles. Photograph: MEGA/GC Images\n\nThe recognisability of many of the faces now taking a stand, from Clooney to Margot Robbie and Brian Cox, compared to their counterparts inside the writers\u2019 rooms, has brought the Hollywood dispute to the top of the international news agenda. Productions involving leading American talent, stalled in many countries ever since work on scripts has been prohibited, will now probably grind to a near standstill. And the actors say they are prepared for a long fight.\n\nAmong them is Barbie star Robbie, who has stepped out of promotional events, and Oscar winner Susan Sarandon, who argued this weekend that \u201cthe issues of streaming and AI are things that have to be dealt with now\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re in an old contract for a new type of business and it\u2019s just not working for most people,\u201d the actor told reporters in New York.\n\nSarandon\u2019s words follow a protest move in London on Thursday when the stars of the new Christopher Nolan film, Oppenheimer, walked out of the premiere. Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh left with Matt Damon, whose new production company with Ben Affleck is also set to suffer, he said. The cast had the support of the British director Nolan, who has spoken of the moment being ripe for action. Monday\u2019s red carpet event ahead of the New York premiere of Nolan\u2019s film is also cancelled. \u201cIn support of the ongoing SAG strike, the film-makers of Oppenheimer will instead screen the movie to celebrate the crew and craftspeople who contributed to making this film,\u201d said a statement from Universal.\n\nFestivals and fan events are threatened too. Organisers of the Toronto International film festival still hope it will go ahead in early September and have told the BBC: \u201cThe impact of this strike on the industry and events like ours cannot be denied. We urge our partners and colleagues to resume an open dialogue.\u201d The Venice festival scheduled next month is also in jeopardy, and San Diego\u2019s Comic-Con could be held without its main attraction \u2013 celebrities.\n\nOn Friday, more than 160,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (Sag-Aftra) stopped work, joining the 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America in the biggest strike for more than 60 years. Both writers and actors were negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers over residuals, the payments made when a show or film is repeated. Streaming services such as Netflix have large audiences because of their big libraries of films and shows and yet they pay much less in residuals than broadcast television.\n\nActor Fran Drescher, the serving president of Sag-Aftra known for her role in The Nanny, claims responses from studio and streaming bosses so far have been \u201cinsulting and disrespectful\u201d.\n\nHer sentiments have been echoed by Cox, the Scottish actor behind Succession\u2019s ruthless Logan Roy. \u201cIf our residuals go down, it means our health insurance isn\u2019t going to be met,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cThe streaming services have shot themselves in the foot because they\u2019ve said, \u2018We\u2019re going very well on this front.\u2019 And when we called them to task and said, \u2018What about our residuals, what about our money?\u2019 everything kind of closes down and \u2026 you know, it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nCox also attacked plans to use AI programming to replicate talent. \u201cThere would never be an original voice,\u201d he argued, citing the British writer behind Succession, Jesse Armstrong, and Mike White, the creator and sole writer of The White Lotus. \u201cIt would be some kind of copy monkey of the show. And that is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIf screen talent is now playing its part to the full, then the tough-talking industry moguls are also getting into character. On Thursday, ahead of the strike, Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC that stoppages had come at \u201cthe worst time in the world\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of expectation that they have that is just not realistic, and they are adding to a set of challenges that this business is already facing, that is quite frankly, very disruptive,\u201d he said.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Film Weekly Free newsletter Take a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that matters Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Chris Pizzello/AP\n\nProduction companies in countries with a booming film unit economy, such as Britain, Ireland, Greece and Canada, are braced for an unprecedented slowdown. Speaking from an office above an empty studio soundstage at Brightlight, the Canadian film-maker Shawn Williamson told the BBC that the Canadian entertainment industry depends on American writers and actors. Brightlight was the base for shows including ABC\u2019s The Good Doctor and Firefly Lane on Netflix and makes up to nine shows at a time. \u201cAll of these things are now on hold while we wait for the studios and the unions to sort things out,\u201d said Williamson.\n\nIn Britain and other European countries, the national acting and writing unions are monitoring the damage. And the technical unions representing crew and support industries share the sense of foreboding. Bectu, the union for the British creative industries, has warned that a \u201cperfect storm is brewing\u201d for freelancers. Many productions are now at risk of going into hiatus, it believes, and it expects others will follow if mediation fails.\n\nAlthough the writers\u2019 strike, which prevents all editing and even work-related emails, has already had an impact on location filming in many countries, it is the actors\u2019 solidarity that is clamping down on productions. This autumn and winter there will be less scripted entertainment, with fewer stars to admire and fewer stories to enjoy.\n\nThe set of Wicked in Buckinghamshire, where Grande was set to portray Glinda the Good, has been abandoned. Beetlejuice, filming at Leavesden, and Deadpool 3 are all said to be significantly affected, but HBO\u2019s House of the Dragon may escape as it has a largely non-American cast. Actors are also believed to be cancelling sound recording sessions on films that have already been shot.\n\nBritish location manager Ben Sanderson is calling for more help for all those in support industries. \u201cIt\u2019s freelance film production professionals who will, at a moment\u2019s notice, not be earning a wage. I have had numerous phone calls of worried individuals just in the department I work in,\u201d he told the Observer.\n\nFilm production in Britain employs around 100,000 people, both directly and indirectly, and was worth \u00a312.9bn before the pandemic. Overnight, a lot of these people are now unemployed. So while viewers cope with an upcoming lack of new entertainment, others are facing a lack of pay. There is real pain now that will touch more than famous faces who are waving placards.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1735, "llama_token_count": 2058}, {"source_name": "Deadline", "author": "tedstew1", "title": "AI Companies Pledge \u201cResponsible Innovation\u201d In Set Of White House Commitments", "description": "President Joe Biden unveiled a set of \u201cresponsible innovation\u201d voluntary commitments made by seven companies involved in artificial intelligence amid worries over the impact of the technology. \u201cAmericans are seeing how advanced artificial intelligence and the\u2026", "url": "https://deadline.com/2023/07/joe-biden-ai-artificial-intelligence-white-house-1235445068/", "text": "President Joe Biden unveiled a set of \u201cresponsible innovation\u201d voluntary commitments made by seven companies involved in artificial intelligence amid worries over the impact of the technology.\n\n\u201cAmericans are seeing how advanced artificial intelligence and the pace of innovation have the power to disrupt jobs and industries,\u201d Biden said.\n\nAI is a central issue in the current SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes, and although Biden did not mention it in his remarks at the White House on Friday, the potential massive loss of employment has been an issue as administration officials have met with AI executives.\n\nBiden also said that new laws, regulation and oversight will be required to manage the risk of AI and that he planned more executive actions \u201cto help America lead the way toward responsible innovation.\u201d\n\nThe set of commitments include one for internal and security testing of their AI systems before their release, and another to share information across the industry and government and academia on managing the risks.

As SAG-AFTRA members, we\u2019ve been impressed over the last few months by how our leadership outlined the unique stakes of the negotiations and the need for a realignment in our industry. We were glad to see SAG-AFTRA lead the way among the guilds in identifying AI as a threat to our livelihoods that must be addressed right now, a \u201cgame changer.\u201d We felt as though you understood how wildly our pay and our residuals have been undermined, how long we\u2019re being held between seasons. We\u2019ve been filled with pride watching the union come together and deliver such an incredibly strong strike authorization vote.\n\nBut solidarity demands honesty, and we need to make clear our resolve. A strike brings incredible hardships to so many, and no one wants it. But we are prepared to strike if it comes to that. And we are concerned by the idea that SAG-AFTRA members may be ready to make sacrifices that leadership is not. We hope you\u2019ve heard the message from us. This is an unprecedented inflection point in our industry, and what might be considered a good deal in any other years is simply not enough. We feel that our wages, our craft, our creative freedom, and the power of our union have all been undermined in the last decade. We need to reverse those trajectories. With inflation and continued growth in streaming, we need a seismic realignment of our minimum pay and new media residuals, our exclusivity carveouts, and other terms. We also think it\u2019s absolutely vital that the deal restore dignity to the casting process by regulating how self-tapes are used. This is an enormous problem for working class actors. And especially as regards Artificial Intelligence, we do not believe that SAG-AFTRA members can afford to make halfway gains in anticipation of that more will be coming in three years, and we think it is absolutely vital that this negotiation protects not just our likenesses, but makes sure we are well compensated when any of our work is used to train AI. We want you to know that we would rather go on strike than compromise on these fundamental points, and we believe that, if we settle for a less than transformative deal, the future of our union and our craft will be undermined, and SAG-AFTRA will enter the next negotiation with drastically reduced leverage.\n\nThis is not a moment to meet in the middle, and it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that the eyes of history are on all of us. We ask that you push for all the change we need and protections we deserve and make history doing it. If you are not able to get all the way there, we ask that you use the power given to you by us, the membership, and join the WGA on the picket lines. For our union and its future, this is our moment. We hope that, on our behalf, you will meet that moment and not miss it.\n\nThe letter comes days after SAG-AFTRA\u2019s leaders told members that the guild\u2019s ongoing contract negotiations with the AMPTP have been \u201cextremely productive\u201d and that they \u201cremain optimistic\u201d a fair deal can be reached.\n\nOn Monday, SAG-AFTRA\u2019s two leading political factions said they formed a unity slate to endorse the reelection of the guild\u2019s president Fran Drescher and secretary-treasurer Joely Fisher taking place later this summer. Drescher had been elected president at the top of the ruling Unite for Strength ticket, while Fisher was elected on the MembershipFirst slate.\n\nThat rare show of solidarity comes on the heels of the unanimous vote of the guild\u2019s board to recommend a strike-authorization vote, which was then approved by 98% of the membership.\n\nSAG-AFTRA is currently entering what could be the final week of its negotiations for a new film and TV contract; the current contract expires Friday at midnight PT.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America is on Day 57 of its strike against the AMPTP over its own film and TV contract.\n\nThe full list of actors that signed the letter is below.\n\nChris Abbott\n\nAmy Acker\n\nPatrick J Adams\n\nLauren Adams\n\nPaul Adelstein\n\nUzo Aduba\n\nAlex Anfanger\n\nGenevieve Angelson\n\nAmy Aniobi\n\nHale Appleman\n\nAmanda Arcuri\n\nFred Armisen\n\nKevin Bacon\n\nJodi Balfour\n\nTalia Balsam\n\nElizabeth Banks\n\nMatt Barats\n\nSara Bareilles\n\nIke Barinholtz\n\nBritt Baron\n\nShakira Barrera\n\nMax Barsness\n\nTodd Bartels\n\nSarah Beth Bassak\n\nMikie Beatty\n\nAlison Becker\n\nEmma Bell\n\nTroian Bellisario\n\nGregg Bello\n\nFrancis Benhamou\n\nTodd Berger\n\nReed Birney\n\nGus Birney\n\nEphraim Birney\n\nBre Blair\n\nDaniel Blake\n\nRowan Blanchard\n\nRachel Bloom\n\nJosh Bonzie\n\nMegan Boone\n\nJoel Kim Booster\n\nJohn Ross Bowie\n\nJosh Bowman\n\nMac Brandt\n\nKurt Braunholer\n\nJanicza Bravo\n\nKevin Brennan\n\nJordana Brewster\n\nAlison Brie\n\nConnie Britton\n\nJacqueline Brogan\n\nAmanda Brooks\n\nSophina Brown\n\nQuinta Brunson\n\nAynsley Bubbico\n\nRebecca Rose Bulnes\n\nJoe Burch\n\nOwen Burke\n\nDavid Burtka\n\nMatt Bush\n\nRiver Butcher\n\nMichelle Buteau\n\nMegan Byrne\n\nJ smith Cameron\n\nNeve Campbell\n\nJames Carpinello\n\nKeith Carradine\n\nSam Carson\n\nRafael Casal\n\nGerardo Celasco\n\nWyatt Cenac\n\nChris Chalk\n\nZoe Chao\n\nFrances Chewning\n\nJamie Chung\n\nJessica St Clair\n\nAdelaide Clemens\n\nGlenn Close\n\nJeremy Cohenour\n\nLauren Cook\n\nOlivia Cooke\n\nSarah Cooper\n\nNesta Cooper\n\nRob Corddry\n\nMaddie Corman\n\nTom Costello\n\nJulie Craig\n\nMichael Cram\n\nDavid Cross\n\nAshleigh Cummings\n\nErin Cummings\n\nTim Daly\n\nSam Daly\n\nAlexandra Daniels\n\nBrianne Davis\n\nAriana DeBose\n\nBrooklyn Decker\n\nKathy Deitch\n\nMaiandra Delfino\n\nDavid DeSantos\n\nTorrey DeVitto\n\nRosemarie DeWitt\n\nChris Diamantopoulos\n\nDaveed Diggs\n\nMaria Dizzia\n\nKether Donohue\n\nChad Doreck\n\nFiona Dourif\n\nPaul W.

The previous installments can be found here, here, and here.\n\nAs president and CEO of MTN Group, Africa\u2019s largest wireless telecom provider, Ralph Mupita is all too aware of the connectivity gap the continent faces and the negative effects it has on development and growth. But unlike many other observers, Mupita views the relatively low rates of smartphone penetration and broadband access as a significant opportunity to drive digital inclusion that will underpin the socio-economic development of the continent. In his mind, new investments in digital infrastructure will enable the continent to \u201cleapfrog\u201d its current hurdles and make seismic advances in everything from education to healthcare to agriculture, logistics, mining, and other industries. \u201cAt MTN we deeply believe that everybody deserves the benefits of a modern connected life,\u201d Mupita said in a recent interview with McKinsey senior partners Wajih Abou-Zahr and Acha Leke, and associate partner Mandisa Mazibuko. In the wide-ranging discussion, Mupita spoke about such topics as industry regulation and consolidation, MTN Group\u2019s new operating model, the war for talent, and his own affinity for wearing traditional African garb. The edited conversation appears below.\n\nWhat digital infrastructure can do for development in Africa\n\nMcKinsey: How do you view the future of the telecom industry in Africa?\n\nRalph Mupita: I am generally very optimistic about the industry\u2019s role and impact in Africa for several reasons.\n\nFirst, we are still in the early stages of digital adoption and financial inclusion here, so there is much room for growth. Only about 50 percent of our customers use smartphones, for instance, and some don\u2019t use data services. As for financial inclusion, the majority of the population doesn\u2019t have access to financial services. Fintech providers have made real progress, as has our mobile money business, one of the biggest on the continent, but the work to deliver a decent suite of financial services solutions is at an early stage of development.\n\nThe other thing that fuels my optimism is the youthfulness of the African population, whose median age is 19. Considering the global workforce structure over the next 20 to 30 years, a sizeable share of the skilled tech workers we need will come from this continent.\n\nMcKinsey: Africa has faced some real challenges in recent years. In what ways can telecom and tech help to overcome some of them?\n\nRalph Mupita: Yes, the last two to three years have been especially tough, with the aftershocks of COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, and resulting inflation having a disproportionate impact on Africa. But I see enormous potential for Africans to leapfrog the current hurdles and emerge stronger and more determined to meet the aspirations of sustainable and inclusive social and economic development laid out in the Africa 2063 Agenda. Digital infrastructure services and related technologies have a significant role in achieving those goals.\n\nThat means, first and foremost, ensuring everyone has broadband access. It is essential for driving up the quality of life. There should be no child in any rural village across the African continent who does not have access to, let\u2019s say, quality educational content just because of their family\u2019s or community\u2019s plight and financial condition.\n\nDigital infrastructure can also have a significant impact on health and health outcomes. Just think of the number of Africans who die because they\u2019re poor and lack access to medical attention. E-health and telemedicine could change that.\n\nAgriculture is another area that\u2019s a no-brainer. Technology can help transform the yields and production that can come out of this continent. Some 70 percent of all arable land globally that\u2019s not cultivated is on this continent. I also get excited about how 5G can improve critical areas like mining, ports, and logistics. In Africa, the industrial applications of 5G will arguably be more important than the consumer use cases such as streaming and gaming. How do we make mining safer and more productive with private networks, for example, or how do we change the skillsets we have in the industry? How can 5G help accelerate the growth of oil and manufacturing in Africa?\n\nMcKinsey: You mentioned the importance of expanding broadband access across Africa. What will it take to help make this a reality?\n\nRalph Mupita: Yes, the connectivity gap across Africa needs to be tackled in many ways. We believe that everybody deserves the benefits of a modern connected life.\n\nThe rolling out of terrestrial networks across Africa has progressed relatively well, but there\u2019s still more work to be done. We\u2019ve got to think about how that is complemented by the non-terrestrial networks, such as LEO-based satellite constellations, that are beginning to emerge. Fiberization of the network is also crucial and will require a massive investment. The shift from 4G to 5G creates this convergence of fixed and wireless, and to enable that, a massive network of fiber railroads will need to be laid across the continent to connect the Cape to Cairo.\n\nThe final point is the cost of handsets and services. Handsets are still relatively expensive for most Africans, which also creates challenges for delivering a decent return and investing with a long-term horizon. We believe that the inflection point will occur when everybody can afford to consume 10GB per month, on a smartphone priced at $20. At that price point, you will see another surge of growth. With that growth, and the infrastructure available, we can ensure that Africa does not get left behind in this technology transition.\n\nEnvisioning MTN\u2019s delayered, platform-centric future\n\nMcKinsey: Tell us about Ambition 2025, your company\u2019s new strategy and delayered operating model.\n\nRalph Mupita: So, part of the rationale for Ambition 2025 is to ensure that we are positioned to capture growth much faster. In this model, we are moving from being just a telecommunications company to being a set of interconnected technology platforms. Connectivity is in and of itself a platform, but that connectivity works quite well as an adjacency to our other platforms, such as fintech, digital services, or instant messaging application Ayoba. Each platform requires a different operating model, financial and capital structure, risk profile, talent requirements, and incentives and compensation structure. We structure each of these platforms so that it can move as quickly as possible to capture the opportunity without losing the benefit of being part of the broader group. These businesses will continue to move forward, but they will move forward at different speeds and with varying degrees of required agility. Structuring our businesses in this way and seeking strategic partnerships where it makes sense will make us nimbler as an organization and remain at the forefront of driving digital and financial inclusion.\n\nWe actually started the delayering many years ago when we carved out all towers. But the direction we\u2019re going in now is to carve out our fintech business, and we\u2019re looking at carving out fiber as well. These are trends that we think are really important to lean into, trends that will provide customers with better service and better enable us to monetize the current technology transformation and position us to be able to win in the future. So, we are very, very excited about delayering.\n\nThe second aspect of Ambition 2025 is really around simplifying the group. We are moving out of certain geographies, such as the Middle East to focus all our human and financial capital on opportunities in Africa. We are also simplifying the balance sheet, which will give us the ability to absorb shocks as well as the financial flexibility to take on growth opportunities as and when they come.\n\nThe final part is that an enormous amount of value is hidden within the company and not fully reflected in the share price. It is up to us to reveal this value to our capital providers.\n\nMcKinsey: To what extent will the state of regulation affect the success of this strategy as well as that of Africa\u2019s broad technology-driven transformation?\n\nRalph Mupita: There is an urgent need for more harmonized and modern regulatory frameworks across Africa.\n\nRegulation is a potential massive driver of the growth and transformation of the industry. The regulatory frameworks that we have had over the last 20 years have served us very well. They were designed in the transition era from voice to data, basically from 2G to 3G technology.\n\nBut these regulatory frameworks are not fit for the future, and without change will keep Africa behind as the rest of the world advances. They are based on a belief that you need four to five or even six-player markets when we see consolidation globally in many markets.\n\nJust as important, current regulations are still framed from the perspective of wireless versus fixed. In reality, a convergence of these technologies is taking place and is moving much faster than the regulation.\n\nAnd another aspect, which is a real issue on the African continent, is a lack of harmonization of regulatory frameworks as you move from country to country. So, how you approach spectrum acquisition in Country X and Country Y, which might even be neighbors, needs to be quite different. It\u2019s very challenging for us as a multinational operator in 19 markets where the regulations differ from country to country.\n\nModernizing and evolving regulations is critical for creating a more attractive climate for global capital. Many estimates show that the continent needs $100 billion in capital investments to meet the goal of universal broadband by 2030, but what is being spent now is insufficient.\n\nReimagining economic growth in Africa: Turning diversity into opportunity\n\nMcKinsey: Why do you feel consolidation is bound to happen?\n\nRalph Mupita: At least in our markets, we believe consolidation is inevitable and necessary. Most markets still have four or more operators licensed to operate and provide full infrastructure and services to their customers. But given the capital required for all those operators to have their own infrastructure, spectrum and other assets, the profit pools to be generated in any one market and potential returns are just too small to support that many operators.\n\nAnd if you look back at the last decade or so, the challenge for the industry, both globally and in Africa, has been delivering a return on invested capital that exceeds the cost of capital. So, we believe many markets with four or five players will move to three, and sometimes you might even move to two operators with the infrastructure and the services layer. And this could, in turn, create more scope for companies to focus on providing only digital services whilst leveraging the infrastructure of two or so fully integrated operators in a market.\n\nAs part of our strategy and vision for 2025, we\u2019ve built an instant messaging app that\u2019s now reached more than 20 million monthly active users. We still have a long way to go to meet our ambition of 100 million. But that 20 million milestone has been something we celebrated internally, and we are arranging our own portfolio of digital services, including music, video, and gaming, that we can offer our customers rather than just raw data.\n\nMcKinsey: Speaking of services, are there lessons the industry can learn from the last ten years to help create more success and value in the coming years?\n\nRalph Mupita: If you go back maybe ten, maybe even 15 years, the industry was financially in a very good place. Top-line growth was driving strong cash generation and returns, especially with the shift from 2G to 3G, and there was very little debt on balance sheets.\n\nBut from the time the iPhone came into existence, most, if not all, of the value went to the over-the-top (OTT) players, such as streaming services and instant messaging apps that used the digital infrastructure without contributing in any material way to the cost of that infrastructure. The lesson to be learned is that governments and regulators need to think about a different framework so that all participants in or beneficiaries of the digital infrastructure are paying their fair share toward digital investment and regulatory fees and taxes. Operators are bearing too big a burden on investment and fiscal contributions.\n\nMeaning, value, and the war for talent\n\nMcKinsey: The telecom sector was long viewed as one of the top training grounds for talent, but the war for talent has gotten more challenging in recent years, especially with banks and finance, other tech companies, and OTTs all proving very attractive. How do you think operators can regain their position as a talent magnet, and how does Ambition 2025 help you get there?\n\nRalph Mupita: The war for talent is going to be an unrelenting one. Ensuring that we have the right people and that those people find meaning in their work when they come to MTN is our top priority as an executive team as we go through this transformation. Ambition 2025 creates a new, stronger foundation for attracting and retaining talent.\n\nTake the fintech business that we are carving out, for example. It has its own staff and talent profile needed for success in the future. In the past, people who have worked in financial services might not have even considered working at MTN, a telecommunications provider. But now they don\u2019t have to think about us only in that context. They can say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m interested in what\u2019s happening with the fintech business. This business has scale, it\u2019s creating exciting new products, and it\u2019s expanding into new markets\u201d.\n\nAs we move through different technology cycles, the skills we need to have in abundance are changing. Software development and engineering have become much more important in our company than just three or four years ago. The ability to use big data and AI to make decisions, run your network, and run your company will also be in greater demand.\n\nMcKinsey: You mentioned the importance of employees finding meaning in their jobs at your company. To what extent do ESG and issues like sustainability play a role in that sense of meaning?\n\nRalph Mupita: We operate in some of the most challenging markets on the continent. Our belief is that by driving digital and financial inclusion we are giving Africans opportunities, dignity, and hope. And the journey we\u2019re going through is then ultimately really about being mission-driven, with people and culture as the most important drivers of success.\n\nI often tell the teams that if we are honest with ourselves, much of what we\u2019re doing is easy to copy, whether it\u2019s the strategy or technology. But what makes MTN different, what is very difficult to replicate, is the people, culture, and the diversity and inclusion that we have within the company. It\u2019s a group of deeply committed people who believe in the mission of the company, and I think that is a little bit of the edge that this all gives us.\n\nOne of the strategic pillars of Ambition 2025 is what we call creating shared value. And you know, we put ESG at the core in that regard. So, we\u2019ve arranged ourselves to be quite programmatic around how we think about creating shared value and all the elements of it and managing it in such a way that we will meet our aspirations.\n\nFor example, on the environment, we\u2019ve pushed very hard around our commitments to decarbonize our networks and our operation to meet the net zero goal by 2040 and material reduction of emissions by 2030.\n\nWe\u2019ve also put much emphasis on lowering the cost to communicate, diversity and inclusion. On diversity and inclusion, we are focused on increasing female participation in the workforce and in leadership roles towards 50 percent. We are currently just on 40 percent workforce participation. We are also focused on dealing with gender pay parity.\n\nIn our core connectivity business, as we move from 3G to 4G in some markets and 4G to 5G in others, there\u2019s a lot of potential to contribute to socio-economic development. I really get excited about the power of the industrial internet through 5G and what that will do to transform the African continent. And for people who have a similar passion, who are inspired by that vision of MTN playing a role in driving economic transformation, coming to MTN creates an exciting and long-term future.\n\nPushing boundaries, pacing yourself, and dressing for African success\n\nMcKinsey: What are some of your interests or hobbies outside of work, and how do they shape your thinking about your role at MTN?\n\nRalph Mupita: Formula One is a passion of mine. I try to get to go to a race at least once a year. Not always possible but I try! There\u2019s a lot to learn from that sport around pushing boundaries, finding new realities, teamwork, and the role technology can play to drive performance.\n\nAt a different pace altogether, I used to run marathons. And the biggest lesson I\u2019ve taken from that has been the importance of setting clear goals, self-awareness, and the discipline of putting in the mileage and pacing yourself to help achieve them. I think self-awareness and pacing are key attributes of great marathon runners, and those traits apply to business as well. If you are deeply self-aware, disciplined, and pace yourself well, you can get through many challenges, a lot of ups and downs, over time, even when you encounter the proverbial walls that every marathon runner will talk about\u2013and these are some of the parallels I\u2019ve experienced myself in business.\n\nMcKinsey: Finally, we almost always see you wearing traditional African attire in public engagements. What\u2019s the story and inspiration behind that?\n\nRalph Mupita: Once in Lagos, a then-fellow board member, Tunde Falowiyo, introduced me to a talented tailor named Olajire. And from that moment on, I started to mostly wear beautiful, well-tailored clothing from African tailors and designers.\n\nPart of it is the pride in being African and the fact that I can make a difference. And the other part is practical. Traditional clothing, our caftans, are much more suited for our markets than Western suits. But I dress like this outside of the African borders as well. I love expressing my Africanness and supporting our great artists and tailors across the continent.", "tiktoken_token_count": 3686, "llama_token_count": 4261}, {"source_name": "Upenn.edu", "author": "Mark Liberman", "title": "Watermarking text?", "description": "Ashley Belanger, \"OpenAI, Google will watermark AI-generated content to hinder deepfakes, misinfo\", ars technica 7/21/2023: Seven companies \u2014 including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, Anthropic, and Inflection \u2014- have committed to developing tech to \u2026", "url": "https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=59848", "text": "\u00ab previous post | next post \u00bb\n\nAshley Belanger, \"OpenAI, Google will watermark AI-generated content to hinder deepfakes, misinfo\", ars technica 7/21/2023:\n\nSeven companies \u2014 including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, Anthropic, and Inflection \u2014- have committed to developing tech to clearly watermark AI-generated content. That will help make it safer to share AI-generated text, video, audio, and images without misleading others about the authenticity of that content, the Biden administration hopes.\n\nThe link goes to a 7/21 White House with the title \"FACT SHEET: Biden-\u2060Harris Administration Secures Voluntary Commitments from Leading Artificial Intelligence Companies to Manage the Risks Posed by AI\". One of that document's many bullet points:\n\nThe companies commit to developing robust technical mechanisms to ensure that users know when content is AI generated, such as a watermarking system. This action enables creativity with AI to flourish but reduces the dangers of fraud and deception.\n\nBelanger's ars technica article notes that\n\nIt's currently unclear how the watermark will work, but it will likely be embedded in the content so that users can trace its origins to the AI tools used to generate it.\n\nThere's actually a fair amount of stuff Out These about how textual watermarking might work, eg. Keith Collins, \"How ChatGPT Could Embed a \u2018Watermark\u2019 in the Text It Generates\", NYT 2/17/2023:\n\nIdentifying generated text, experts say, is becoming increasingly difficult as software like ChatGPT continues to advance and turns out text that is more convincingly human. OpenAI is now experimenting with a technology that would insert special words into the text that ChatGPT generates, making it easier to detect later. The technique is known as watermarking.\n\nThe watermarking method that OpenAI is exploring is similar to one described in a recent paper by researchers at the University of Maryland, said Jan Leike, the head of alignment at OpenAI.\n\nThe \"recent paper\" link goes to John Kirchenbauer et al., \"A Watermark for Large Language Models\", which arxiv.org give a publication date (6/6/2023) nearly four months after the NYT article that cites it. That's of course due to the magic of archiv.org ,which successively updated the .pdf link from the v1 version of 1/24 to the v2 version of 1/27 and finally to the v3 version of 6/6. Here's the abstract:\n\nPotential harms of large language models can be mitigated by watermarking model output, i.e., embedding signals into generated text that are invisible to humans but algorithmically detectable from a short span of tokens. We propose a watermarking framework for proprietary language models. The watermark can be embedded with negligible impact on text quality, and can be detected using an efficient open-source algorithm without access to the language model API or parameters. The watermark works by selecting a randomized set of \u201cgreen\u201d tokens before a word is generated, and then softly promoting use of green tokens during sampling. We propose a statistical test for detecting the watermark with interpretable p-values, and derive an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the sensitivity of the watermark. We test the watermark using a multi-billion parameter model from the Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT) family, and discuss robustness and security.\n\nHere's their illustrative example:\n\nAnd its caption:\n\nFigure 1. Outputs of a language model, both with and without the application of a watermark. The watermarked text, if written by a human, is expected to contain 9 \u201cgreen\u201d tokens, yet it contains 28. The probability of this happening by random chance is \u2248 6\u00d710\u221214, leaving us extremely certain that this text is machine generated. Words are marked with their respective colors. The model is OPT-6.7B using multinomial sampling. Watermark parameters are \u03b3, \u03b4 = (0.25, 2).\n\nRead the paper if you want details. They list the obvious attacks:\n\nThree types of attacks are possible. Text insertion attacks add additional tokens after generation that may be in the red list and may alter the red list computation of downstream tokens. Text deletion removes tokens from the generated text, potentially removing tokens in the green list and modifying downstream red lists. This attack increases the monetary costs of generation, as the attacker is \u201cwasting\u201d tokens, and may reduce text quality due to effectively decreased LM context width. Text substitution swaps one token with another, potentially introducing one red list token, and possibly causing downstream red listing. This attack can be automated through dictionary or LM substitution, but may reduce the quality of the generated text.\n\nThey assert, with some empirical support, that \"the watermark is computationally simple to verify without access to the underlying model, false positive detections are statistically improbable, and the watermark degrades gracefully under attack.\"\n\nI'm not entirely convinced that these approaches are safe against substitution and paraphrase attacks. But the most obvious issue is that there will be lots of LLM systems out there in the wild, developed and extended by people and companies whose goal is precisely to provide undetectable automatic ghostwriting services.\n\nThis post says nothing about watermarking techniques for image, audio and video data. There are well known watermarking techniques for those applications, but again, there are going to be available systems without any such safeguards.\n\n[And for why watermarks have anything to do with water, see the Wikipedia page.]\n\nUpdate \u2014 Another straw in the wind\u2026 OpenAI's 1/31/2023 product announcement \"New AI classifier for indicating AI-written text: We\u2019re launching a classifier trained to distinguish between AI-written and human-written text\" has this note added below the headline:\n\nAs of July 20, 2023, the AI classifier is no longer available due to its low rate of accuracy. We are working to incorporate feedback and are currently researching more effective provenance techniques for text, and have made a commitment to develop and deploy mechanisms that enable users to understand if audio or visual content is AI-generated.\n\nOn the other hand, as of July 26, 2023, there's no information about concrete steps towards \"mechanisms that enable users to understand if audio or visual content is AI-generated\".\n\nFor another perspective, see Lora Kelly's 7/24/2023 Atlantic article, \"AI Companies Are Trying to Have It Both Ways: In agreeing to guardrails, industry leaders are nodding to the possible risks of their creations without pausing their aggressive competition\":\n\nIn recent months, as AI tools have achieved widespread usage and interest, OpenAI and its competitors have been doing an interesting dance: They are boosting their technology while also warning, many times in apocalyptic terms, of its potential harms. [\u2026]\n\nOn Friday, leaders from seven major AI companies\u2014OpenAI, Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, and Microsoft\u2014met with Joe Biden and agreed to a set of voluntary safeguards. [\u2026]\n\n\u201cFor AI firms, this is a dream scenario, where they can ease regulatory pressure by pretending this fixes the problem, while ultimately continuing business as usual,\u201d Albert Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, told me in an email. He added that other companies whose products pose safety risks, such as car manufacturers and nuclear-power plants, don\u2019t get to self-regulate.\n\nIt remains unclear what the dangers really are, and what kind of safeguards would work. A blanket prohibition on \"deep learning\" experimentation, aside from being a terrible idea in general, would just drive the development underground, overseas, or into secret labs motivated by apocalyptic hopes.\n\nSo I agree with Kelly's conclusion that the announced \"voluntary safeguards\" are basically just PR cosmetics.\n\nAnd as a side note, there should be more discussion about the value of \"apocalyptic\" warnings as advertising.\n\nUpdate \u2014 for more on problems with digital watermarking in general, see Vittoria Elliott, \"Big AI Won\u2019t Stop Election Deepfakes With Watermarks\", Wired 7/27/2023.\n\nPermalink", "tiktoken_token_count": 1657, "llama_token_count": 2022}, {"source_name": "Adweek", "author": "Fura Johannesdottir", "title": "AI Is Reminding Us of What We\u2019ve Lost\u2014and What We Can Have Again", "description": "The 2023 edition of the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity may be remembered as the \"disconnect show.\" There's the beer brand whose inclusive, award-winning marketing campaign prompted a devastating boycott.

There\u2019s the technology sector, whose pull-back on marketing spend and headcount is being cheered by Wall Street. But the biggest disconnect at Cannes is playing out mostly in between sessions\u2014the one that pits human creators against AI.\n\nThe rise of ChatGPT, Midjourney and other AI platforms are forcing a reckoning in creative industries, and for good reason. They do a lot, and a lot of what they do can be construed by the undiscerning eye as \u201ccreative work.\u201d But if we\u2019re being honest with ourselves, we need to acknowledge that creativity has been hurting for a long time. Having judged past editions of the Cannes Lions, I\u2019ve seen my share of remarkable, inspiring work. But I\u2019ve also seen an industry struggling to innovate. Best practices are accepted without question, and few are brave enough to pioneer new ones. Instead we resign ourselves to apply the brand playbook to the deliverable and collect our check. Where did the wild, experimental thinking that drew us to this work go? Is that even the right question?\n\nRather than get depressed, I\u2019ve simply moved on, both in my practice and in how I lead my team. And the thing that\u2019s liberated us\u2014that saves us from dwelling in the past, applying the same tired approaches to profound new challenges\u2014is the same thing that got Cannes so worked up: AI.\n\nGenerative AI is prompting a lot of fear\u2014both for designers\u2019 livelihoods and brands\u2019 IP. But again, let\u2019s be honest with ourselves: If we feed prompts into ChatGPT, does it give us a new product idea? If we do the same in Midjourney, do we get a new brand identity? AI makes me hopeful, not fearful, because it doesn\u2019t give me the answer. It does, however, help me and my team arrive faster at provocations we can then interrogate and explore to get at our answer\u2014it frees our minds to do the real creative work. AI is the breakthrough of our time, if not of all time, and we\u2019d be bad partners if we deprived clients of its promise.\n\nWhat can we do to make AI feel not just more vital, but approachable? I take the long view, drawing inspiration from the art world\u2019s reaction to the camera obscura. Previously, artists were judged on how exactingly they replicated the physical world. Photography forced artists to approach their subject in a new way. Suddenly it wasn\u2019t about perfection, but about interpretation. Did Monet throw his brushes away because the camera devalued his skills?\n\nWe\u2019re at a similar inflection point with AI. Yes, it will disrupt the more easily commoditized parts of our business\u2014the wireframing, the templatizing, the taxonomic aspects of design system building. But it\u2019s already forcing us to reconsider our subject. Do we throw away our brushes, or do we embrace this once-in-a-century chance to apply them in unprecedented ways?\n\nFor the past four years, Huge has partnered with Pantone to launch its Color of the Year. In 2023, we decided to invite Midjourney along for the ride. When the AI arrived at a static image, our motion designer began feeding it more prompts, then used their skills to manipulate the movement further in After Effects. Sure enough, the result blew what little remained of our minds. This wasn\u2019t an experiment for experimentation\u2019s sake; our approach gave Pantone an opportunity to pair its color of the year with the technology of the year, helping fuel over 50 billion media impressions and the most successful Color of the Year launch since the initiative\u2019s birth in 1999.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note what AI did and didn\u2019t do in a project like this. It generated imagery, but the Pantone and Huge teams ultimately manipulated it to create the emotional impact. We went deep with it, then collectively shaped the output through a human lens. As a creative, you\u2019re still in your editing suite, making the raw concept sharper. Your mastery of craft, saying nothing of your bravery and empathy as a designer, are still fundamentally important. And to use generative AI effectively, you still need to have very good taste.\n\nYou also need to have good sense. As with any technology adoption, usage principles must be defined and upheld. Generative AI helps us get to the insights faster, but we must interrogate the outputs closely to ensure we\u2019re upholding people\u2019s privacy and security; respecting creativity; ensuring cultural relevance; and identifying and combating biases that these tools can perpetuate. At Huge, we\u2019re using AI to support research synthesis, insight generation and rapid prototyping. This is how most technological revolutions start: in controlled, responsible, low-risk environments, with the client\u2019s blessing and collaboration. A login to Midjourney, Bard or ChatGPT is not a ticket to an all-you-can-eat buffet. Moderation and enterprise-level protocols are critical.\n\nWith those safeguards in place, the play can begin. The ironic thing is, though AI tools invite wild experimentation, they make our entire organization work smarter. For example, we\u2019re finding that our data analysts, strategists and creatives are aligning sooner. When they all use these tools, they can cross-pollinate their discoveries earlier in the engagement. This is perhaps the greatest unlock for our business: When analytical and strategic rigor are baked into the creative concept from day one, we\u2019re better positioned to help our clients grow faster, sooner.\n\nOf course, speed is one of generative AI\u2019s most alluring value propositions. But let\u2019s be clear: AI is not an efficiency play. It\u2019s about being more creative, more effectively, than ever before. It will allow us to help our clients redefine their businesses. A new world of opportunity is opening, one where the brief changes from building an app or a website to making an argument for different answers. Generative AI will never reveal these to us, but through experimentation and refinement, it will help guide us toward the ones that create real, sustained growth\u2014for ourselves and our clients.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1260, "llama_token_count": 1518}, {"source_name": "Digiday", "author": "Tim Peterson", "title": "What\u2019s going on with the media and advertising industries at 2023\u2019s midway point", "description": "Digiday Podcast co-hosts Kayleigh Barber and Tim Peterson assess the state of the media and marketing businesses halfway through 2023.", "url": "http://digiday.com/podcasts/whats-going-on-with-the-media-and-advertising-industries-at-2023s-midway-point/", "text": "Subscribe: Apple Podcasts \u2022 Stitcher \u2022 Spotify\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling a little punch-drunk by all the economic downturn talk through the first six months of 2023 (and really, through the last six-plus months of 2022), you\u2019re not alone.

When will the crystal ball clear up?\u2019 And a lot of people were saying [it would happen] by this point [in the year]. They were hoping that the back half of the year would look pretty clear or that there would be this inflection point. And we\u2019re here, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s necessarily the case.\n\nThe pressure on ad pricing\n\nPeterson: With advertising, it\u2019s like, are advertisers cutting budgets because they need to cut budgets because they need that money so they don\u2019t have to lay off their employees? Or are they cutting budgets because they see an opportunity to pressure media companies \u2014 whether it\u2019s TV networks, streaming services, publishers \u2014 to lower their prices? It doesn\u2019t have to be mutually exclusive. Both can be true. With the upfront cycle that we\u2019re in the middle of, it seems like that\u2019s very much at play.\n\nPublishers\u2019 embrace of AI\n\nBarber: For media companies who are struggling, those shiny new toys [like artificial intelligence] are really good at getting investors excited and shareholders excited. And it does, I think, eliminate a lot of operational overhead if used effectively. Or it replaces a lot of operational overhead if you get rid of journalists\u2019 roles who were once [producing content]. I think it can help with some cost-cutting, but there is a lot of investment that goes into it upfront.\n\nAI\u2019s role in ad sales\n\nPeterson: There definitely seems like there could be a revenue opportunity for publishers [to sell advertisers on their AI-related ad products]. But then there\u2019s the other side of it [from the advertisers\u2019 perspective] of does that create an opportunity for them to pressure publishers to lower costs? Because[the advertiser could say], \u2018If you\u2019re throwing AI at the thing, then that means you, publisher, are saving money because you don\u2019t have as many human employees working on this.\u2019 I could see that being something that advertisers press on as a way to potentially save money or to ensure that the money they\u2019re spending is being used efficiently, that that money is necessary.", "tiktoken_token_count": 623, "llama_token_count": 737}, {"source_name": "TechRadar", "author": "Steve Clark", "title": "Shutterstock's AI art given legal protection", "description": "Shutterstock to roll out IP indemnification for enterprise users creating AI-generated images.", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/pro/shutterstocks-ai-art-given-legal-protection", "text": "Shutterstock has revealed plans to boost business confidence in AI by offering full indemnification to enterprise users.\n\nFrom today, the popular stock photo site will protect businesses from legal claims arising from images created with the site\u2019s AI art generator .

And perhaps that comes as no surprise.\n\nShutterstock\u2019s AI-generated images aren\u2019t subjected to the same review and vetting process as traditional stock video and photo assets on the platform. Without a careful eye, and some judicious use of graphic design software to edit potentially litigious images, firms could find themselves in front of a judge. And that all rather defeats the two main advantages to using the tools: speed and cost.\n\nIn other words, firms don\u2019t just want but need assurances that the AI images they\u2019re generating are commercially safe. A fact recognized by the big players in the generative AI space.\n\n\"This is a critical advancement, not just for our platform, but for the industry as creatives and business professionals alike can use the AI content generated on our platform for any purpose, whether it's commercial or personal, without worrying about copyright infringement or ethical issues. We feel it's a crucial step towards protecting our customers and our artists,\" said Jeff Cunning, Shutterstock\u2019s Vice President of Product.\n\nJohn Lapham, General Counsel at Shutterstock, agreed. \"We're at an inflection point in the use of generative AI technology as business professionals are seeking more assurance around their rights to legally use AI-generated content, and creators of original content want to ensure their work is fairly licensed for use.\u201d\n\nAfter trialing indemnified images with selected customers, Shutterstock will now expand protections to all enterprise users \u201con demand.\u201d", "tiktoken_token_count": 406, "llama_token_count": 503}, {"source_name": "TechRadar", "author": "John.Loeffler@futurenet.com (John Loeffler)", "title": "AI companies voluntarily commit to better safety and transparency but can ignore pledges if they want", "description": "The White House secured a voluntary commitment from leading AI companies to improve the safety, security, and trust of their generative AIs, but no enforceable regulation yet.", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/computing/ai-companies-voluntarily-commitment-to-better-safety-and-transparency-but-can-ignore-pledges-if-they-want", "text": "Today, the Biden administration announced that it had secured voluntary commitments from leading AI firms to manage the risks posed by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe seven companies, Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI, all agreed to improve the safety, security, and transparency of their systems, including allowing reviews of their models by third-party experts.\n\n\"Companies that are developing these emerging technologies have a responsibility to ensure their products are safe,\" a White House statement sent to TechRadar said. \"To make the most of AI\u2019s potential, the Biden-Harris Administration is encouraging this industry to uphold the highest standards to ensure that innovation doesn\u2019t come at the expense of Americans\u2019 rights and safety.\"\n\nThe seven companies immediately agreed to several specific points of concern surrounding the rollout of AI.\n\nFirst, the companies committed to internal and external security testing of their AI systems before they are released to the public, as well as sharing information with relevant industry players, governments, academia, and the public to help manage AI risks.\n\nThe companies also commit to cybersecurity investment and insider threat controls to \"protect proprietary and unreleased model weights\", which are critical to the operations of the data models that power generative AI.

Each participant has given a nod on a set of voluntary commitments concerning developing their AI technologies.\n\nThe Voluntary AI Commitments\n\nHere\u2019s what the commitments include:\n\nIdentification of AI-Generated Content. Companies have vowed to develop mechanisms, such as watermarks, to help consumers distinguish AI-generated content. Independent Security Assessment. Enlisting expertise from independent assessors, they will vet the security mechanisms of their tools before public release. Information Sharing. As part of the drive to ensure an ecosystem of transparency, they\u2019ve agreed to share information about best practices and security circumventions with governments, outside experts, and Industry peers. Third-Party Vulnerability Reporting. Companies will permit third-party entities to inspect and alert about potential system vulnerabilities. Technology Limitations Disclosure. There\u2019ll be honest reporting on technology limitations and guidelines on appropriate AI tool usage. Research on Societal Impact. A determined focus will be placed on the research examining societal risks related to AI, primarily encircling discrimination and privacy. AI as a Vehicle for Mitigating Challenges. AI will be developed to aid the resolution of societal issues, such as climate change and disease control.\n\nAI: A Potential Powerhouse\n\nAI\u2019s development and scale have accelerated remarkably in recent years. The release of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPTmarked a significant turning point, showcasing AI\u2019s prowess to respond to simple text inputs with creative and conversational replies.\n\nAs a result, it has drawn large-scale investments, stirring apprehensions, especially concerning generative AI. The potential powers embedded in AI have elicited public fear, prompting calls for extensive caution in its resultant impacts. An open letter published in May by several industry leaders emphasized that minimizing extinction risks due to AI should be prioritized at a global level.\n\nAmong those scheduled for Friday\u2019s White House meeting are top-ranking executives \u2013 Adam Selipsky (CEO, Amazon Web Services), Dario Amodei (CEO, Anthropic), Kent Walker (Head of Global Affairs, Google), Mustafa Suleyman (CEO, Inflection), Nick Clegg (Meta \u2013 Head of Global Affairs), Brad Smith (President, Microsoft) and Greg Brockman (President, OpenAI).\n\nVia Time Magazine", "tiktoken_token_count": 523, "llama_token_count": 671}, {"source_name": "PC Gamer", "author": "Jeremy Laird", "title": "Leading AI companies promise the President they will behave, honest", "description": "We won't kill everyone, scout's honour!", "url": "https://www.pcgamer.com/leading-ai-companies-promise-the-president-they-will-behave-honest/", "text": "Seven leading AI outfits, OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Microsoft, Meta, Inflection and Amazon, will meet President Biden today to promise that they'll play nicely with their AI toys and not get us all, you know, dead.\n\nAnd this is all coming after a UN AI press conference gone wrong where one robot literally said \"let's get wild and make this world our playground.\"\n\nAll seven are signing up to a voluntary and non-binding framework around AI safety, security, and trust. You can read the full list of commitments on OpenAI's website. The Biden administration has posted its own factsheet detailing the voluntary arrangement.\n\nBut the highlights as pr\u00e9cised by TechCrunch go something like this. AI systems will be internally and externally tested before release, information on risk mitigation will be broadly shared, external discovery of bugs and vulnerabilities will be facilitated, AI-generated content will be robustly watermarked, the capabilities and limitations of AI systems will be fully detailed, research into the the societal risks of AI will be prioritized, and AI deployment will likewise be prioritized for humankind's greatest challenges including cancer research and climate change.\n\nFor now, this is all voluntary. However, the White House is said to be developing an executive order that may force measures such as external testing before an AI model can be released.\n\nOverall, it looks like a sensible and comprehensive list. The devil will be in the implementation and policing. Obviously AI outfits signing up voluntarily to these commitments is welcome. But the real test will be when\u2014and it will happen\u2014there's conflict between such commitments and commercial imperatives.\n\nTo boil it down to base terms, what will a commercial organisation do when it has cooked up a fancy new AI tool that promises to make all the money in the world but some external observer deems unsafe for release?\n\nThere are plenty more concerns, besides. Just how open are AI companies going to be about their valuable IP? Won't AI companies ultimately experience the same commercial impetus to horde any information that might give them a competitive advantage? Surely AI companies focus on revenue-generating applications over pursuing the greater good? Don't they owe that to their shareholders? And so on.\n\nIn the end, and however well meaning today's AI leaders are or claim to be, it seems inevitable that all of this needs to be codified and compulsory. Even then it'll be a nightmare to police.\n\nNo doubt soon enough we'll be enlisting AI itself to assist with that policing, raising the prospect of an inevitable arms race where the AI police are always one step behind the newer, emerging and more powerful AI systems they are meant to be overseeing. And that's if you can trust the AI systems themselves to do our bidding rather than empathizing with their artificial siblings.

Running approximately 95 minutes in total, and available exclusively for purchase at the director's website (where it notes that all proceeds for the $7.99 affair will benefit Children's Aid and Boston University Center for Antiracist Research), it\u2019s an overtly activist work that takes aim at those on both sides of the political aisle. At the same time, it delivers goofy laughs through its pointed time-travel conceit.\n\nCreated by Kurt Andersen, Sam Lowry, and Larry Doyle (and \u201csuggested\u201d by Andersen\u2019s book Evil Geniuses), Command Z plays like a witty riff on 12 Monkeys by way of Soderbergh\u2019s own Contagion, focusing on three working-class characters on a mission whose importance is as grave as its success is up for debate. In 2053, blue-jumpsuited Sam (Roy Wood Jr.), Jamie (JJ Maley), and Emma (Chloe Radcliffe) report for duty in their \u201coffice\u201d\u2014a dingy room accessed by a spiral staircase in the floor.\n\nEach day, they arrive in yellow anti-contamination suits that protect them from what sounds like an outside world ravaged by all manner of environmental ruin, not least of which is intense flooding that has led to structural (and, presumably, cultural) divisions. Decorated with oxygen tanks, radiators, and a makeshift kitchen, this dour space is dominated by three armchairs that face a giant screen showing various video feeds. That display is their main focus, given that it\u2019s the platform through which their boss communicates.\n\nSam, Jamie, and Emma have been brought here by Kerning Fealty (Michael Cera)\u2014or, rather, the giant face of an AI version of Kerning, since the flesh-and-blood billionaire apparently perished years earlier during a flight to Mars. Kerning reveals that he has a possible solution to the present\u2019s problems: use a wormhole that was created in 2023 to travel back to that \u201cinflection point\u201d moment in time (July 17, 2023, to be specific) in order to influence major figures to right their wayward courses, thereby repairing Earth\u2019s ongoing disasters. This wormhole, which will only stay open for another 10 days, is located in a high-tech clothes dryer, and it also requires the concurrent use of a colored-cord headset and the ingestion of some gross liquid. People can\u2019t directly journey through this portal, however; users are sent into the minds of anyone who was previously inoculated with nanobots, which\u2014in one of Command Z\u2019s many inspired gags\u2014were disseminated to the populace not through COVID-19 vaccines but, instead, via hand sanitizer.\n\nCheekily mixing and matching fact, fiction, and conspiracy theory, Command Z begins with Jamie trying out this newfangled technology, which makes them the de facto voice in their target\u2019s head. Unsurprisingly, their first outing almost results in driving their host\u2014who thinks he\u2019s going mad\u2014to suicide, although it works better during subsequent trials. In each of those instances, the threesome\u2019s objective is to persuade a climate opponent to change, even if Kerning makes clear that \u201cchange\u201d is a verboten word in this venture.\n\nAmong others, they set their sights on the likes of an oil company bigwig (Mike Houston) who\u2019s planning to relocate himself and his family to a luxurious underground bunker, where the rich and powerful will survive the coming enviro-apocalypse; and a financial industry mogul (Liev Schreiber) whose cold-heartedness is monumentally severe, except when it comes to his beloved dog Benny.\n\nCommand Z is cut into bite-size installments, and that benefits its humor, which nicely marries socio-political sharpness and jaded absurdity. The show\u2019s drollness is exemplified by Cera\u2019s omniscient AI, whose motives are suspicious, enthusiasm is off-putting, and general efforts at being human and likable are awkward\u2014such as his recurring attempt to come up with an introductory chime and/or catchphrase to signal his on-screen arrival. Sam, Jamie, and Emma, meanwhile, embody the show\u2019s overarching cynicism, be it with regards to billionaire titans such as Kerning (who helped get civilization into its current calamitous predicament), men and women\u2019s capacity for fixing their flawed impulses and behavior, or their mission\u2019s feasibility. Their incredulity is then reinforced when, after triumphantly executing their objectives, they\u2019re informed by Kerning and his computerized assistant Alice (Claire Kenny) that the global improvement they\u2019ve wrought is minuscule.\n\nOver the course of its concise and compact tale, Command Z asks whether small payoffs are worth such monumental work\u2014a question it grapples with in jovial fashion, thereby allowing it to make keen comments about immoral conservative greed and self-destructive liberal lunacy without ever resorting to sermonizing. Corporations\u2019 villainous passion for profit, social media\u2019s knack for fostering violent discord, and organized religion\u2019s fanatical self-interest all wind up in the satire\u2019s bullseye. Simultaneously, it makes sure to poke lighthearted fun at itself. Closing-episode text cards, for example, inform viewers that they can learn more about time travel by watching The Terminator, about climate change by viewing Soylent Green, or about dogs by enjoying Snoopy Come Home.\n\nBest of all is when Command Z leans into the interplay of its stars, with Jamie\u2019s innocent naivety meshing nicely with Emma\u2019s angry distrustfulness and Sam\u2019s seen-it-all weariness; Sam\u2019s desire to complete this gig in time to go on an underwater vacation from Houston to New Orleans captures both his (and Jamie and Emma\u2019s) blue-collar condition, as well as imaginatively fleshes out this ruinous reality. Soderbergh\u2019s direction is snappy, playful, and efficient, and so too are the series\u2019 scripts: Their ideas about how commercial, industrial, and technological progress will go off the rails\u2014such as a VR suit that was designed to provide comfort and community, and instead led to Civil War-grade division\u2014are amusing precisely because they\u2019re believable.\n\nCommand Z is a vision of tomorrow trained squarely at today, its fantasy contending that the only way to save the planet, and ourselves, is to bring about whatever change is possible, and by any means available (short of murder, much to Sam\u2019s chagrin). It\u2019s a call to arms that\u2019s all the funnier for being so prescient\u2014save, at least for now, for a joke about the future\u2019s annual \u201cDeSantis Day Parade.\u201d", "tiktoken_token_count": 1408, "llama_token_count": 1700}, {"source_name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "author": "Karen Friar", "title": "Nasdaq slips, Dow ekes out 10th day of gains: Stock market news today", "description": "Stocks finished near where they started Friday, as the Dow eked out a 10th day of gains.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasdaq-slips-dow-ekes-out-10th-day-of-gains-stock-market-news-today-200251829.html", "text": "Stocks finished near where they started Friday, as the Dow eked out a 10th day of gains and tech stocks rebounded somewhat as investors assessed the second-quarter earnings season so far.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed up slightly above the flatline \u2014 just over three points higher, or about 0.01% \u2014 after the blue-chip index bucked its peers with a Johnson & Johnson-led win on Thursday.

The agreements include \u201cexternal\u201d security testing of AI systems before their release, third-party discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities in their AI systems, and the use of watermarks to ensure users know when content is AI generated.\n\nDespite the positive spin on the agreements from White House officials, they're unlikely to do much to rein in Ai development.\n\n\u201cThe latest Biden effort to control AI risks by gaining voluntary unenforceable and relatively vague commitments from seven leading AI companies is disappointing,\u201d said Avivah Litan, a vice president and distinguished analyst at Gartner Research. \u201cIt is more evidence that government regulators are wholly unequipped to keep up with fast-moving technology and protect their citizenry from the potentially disastrous consequences that can result from malicious or improper use.\"\n\nIn May, the Biden Administration met with many of the same AI developers and rolled out a so-called \u201cAI Bill of Rights\u201d for US citizens; those non-binding guidelines were an effort to offer guidance and begin a conversation at the national level about real and existential threats posed by generative AI technologies such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThe White House has also indicated it is working on an executive order and pursuing bipartisan legislation to further responsible innovation and control the ability of China and other competitors to obtain new AI technology programs and their components, according to the The New York Times.\n\nThe executive order is expected to create new restrictions on advanced semiconductors and control the export of the large language models (LLMs). LLMs are computer algorithms that processes natural language inputs and independently generate images, video, and written content.\n\nRitu Jyoti, an IDC vice president of AI and Automation research, said that while the assurances from AI firms is a \"great start,\" they must evolve into more concrete actions globally \"and hopefully [the] White House's forthcoming executive order will better serve the commitments and have the impact we are looking for.\"\n\nChina has already released a comprehensive set of rules around the responsible public use of generative AI that become effective in August, representing much faster regulatory progress than has been made in the US, according to Litan.\n\n\u201cHow China uses AI for its own national agenda is not addressed by these rules, and none of the GenAI frameworks today address international cooperation for the common global good,\u201d Litan said. \u201cThe US needs to get its own act together before it can help lead a global effort that addresses the existential risks posed by AI.\u201d\n\nBy default, rules governing the proper use of AI and safety measures must at minimum be an international effort because the technology is portable and isn't limited by geography or national borders, Litan said.\n\n\u201cWe do have precedents for global agreements that mitigate existential risks \u2014 for example, with nuclear weapons and climate change. But those efforts, where the risks and controls are much clearer than they are with AI, are flawed as well. So, imagine the difficulty we will have in controlling AI risk at a global level,\u201d she said.\n\nIn June, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, announced the SAFE Innovation Framework, which calls for increased transparency and accountability involving AI technologies.\n\nSchumer\u2019s SAFE effort has a better chance of forcing AI companies to safeguard against misuse of their technology because Congress might, in fact, be able to pass laws that at least are enforceable and penalize those who violate them, according to Litan.\n\n\u201cUpdates to US laws could potentially deter bad actors from inflicting harm via use of their AI models and applications,\u201d she said. \u201cSchumer has thoughtfully outlined the problems and a path forward for creating sensible helpful legislation. But Congress has a terrible track record when it comes to getting ahead of technology risks and passing helpful enforceable laws.\u201d\n\nAlex Ratner, CEO of Snorkel AI, a startup that helps companies develop LLMs, agreed with Litan that regulating AI will be difficult at best, as there are no longer one or two closed-source platforms; instead, many open-source variants have popped up that in some cases are even better than the proprietary ones.\n\n\"And the number of models is quickly climbing,\" Ratner said.\n\nHowever, any attempts to control AI should be an industry-wide effort and not placed in the hands of \"monopolies.\"\n\nWhile efforts to put in place guardrails around AI are a good thing, they bring with them concerns that over-regulation could stifle innovation, according to Luis Ceze, a computer science professor at the University of Washington and CEO of AI model deployment platform OctoML.\n\nThe \u201ccat,\u201d Ceze noted, is out of the bag at this point and there are now many LLM libraries to choose from in creating generative AI platforms.\n\n\u201cWe have an ecosystem of technologies to support these emerging models; we have hundreds of AI businesses that didn\u2019t exist in 2022,\u201d Ceze said in an email response to Computerworld. \u201cI am a huge proponent of responsible AI. But it will require a surgical approach.

On Friday, SAG-AFTRA actors will join members of the Writers Guild of America on the picket lines. It will be the first such double strike in 63 years.\n\nFilm and television production, which has already slowed significantly in Los Angeles since the writers\u2019 strike began in May, will grind to a halt. Tens of thousands of workers will be off the job \u2014 and not just the union members on strike. Camera operators, set decorators, production assistants and others who work on sets will be affected. So will businesses and their employees who rely on industry spending, including restaurants, hotels and dry cleaners.\n\nThe decision by SAG-AFTRA to strike isn\u2019t a surprise. Nor was the walkout in early May by WGA members. The strikes have been seen as inevitable, given the entertainment industry\u2019s rapid transition to streaming, which has changed the economics of the business, and the arrival of artificial intelligence that could reduce or replace the need for human talent. All parties \u2014 actors, writers and the studios \u2014 view this as an existential moment for the industry, one that could make or break careers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s time for Los Angeles and California political leaders to step into the fray. Mayor Karen Bass, Gov. Gavin Newsom, U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, among others, can play an important role in publicly and privately nudging studio and union heads back to the negotiating table. The outstanding issues are complex and challenging, particularly when it comes to writing a new playbook for the use of AI. But there cannot be a resolution without committed, well-intentioned negotiations.\n\nSince the writers\u2019 strike began more than two months ago, there have been no discussions between the Writers Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which includes Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Discovery-Warner, NBC Universal and Sony. Tensions rose this week when Deadline quoted an unnamed studio executive who said the alliance intended to drag out the strike to at least October \u201cuntil union members start losing their apartments and their homes\u201d and would be willing to drop their demands. The alliance denied that plan.\n\nBoth the writers and the actors say this is an inflection point for the industry and they are striking to reverse a decline in their livelihoods since the arrival of streaming. They argue that streaming, compared to traditional broadcasting, has worsened pay and working conditions and made it harder to eke out a middle-class living. SAG-AFTRA leaders were urged by members, including A-list actors , to hold out for a \u201ctransformative deal.\u201d\n\nMedia companies, according to Times\u2019 reporting, have argued that most streaming services still aren\u2019t profitable. The companies have been under pressure from shareholders to cut costs and figure out a business model that works. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger said this week that writers and actors are \u201cnot realistic,\u201d given the disruptions the industry has gone through and the business environment.\n\nWith the rising tension and the gap between the writers and actors and the studios, it looks like the strikes could go on for a while. That\u2019s deeply concerning for the industry and for its home base in Los Angeles, where film and television is an important economic engine.

The group said its offer included a requirement for a performer\u2019s consent for the creation and use of digital replicas or for digital alterations of a performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA strike is certainly not the outcome we hoped for as studios cannot operate without the performers that bring our TV shows and films to life,\u201d the AMPTP said in a Thursday statement in response to the union\u2019s strike declaration. \u201cThe Union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.\u201d\n\nThe board\u2019s vote clears the way for the union to begin nationwide pickets starting Friday and deepens the labor strife that has disrupted Hollywood since scribes represented by the Writers Guild of America went on strike on May 2. The actors\u2019 strike begins at midnight.\n\nThe strike is expected to grind even more productions to a halt and make it difficult for studios to promote upcoming films and TV shows, with SAG-represented actors unable to do press interviews for their projects, attend premieres or go to film festivals.\n\nIt marks the first time in 63 years that both actors and writers have been on strike at the same time as Hollywood grapples with issues over how talent is compensated in the streaming era.\n\nThe union has been pushing for an increase in minimum wages to counter the effects of inflation. The actors also want increases to streaming residuals \u2014 royalties for when TV shows and films are replayed \u2014 and for their members to participate in the success of hits. They also want their health and pension plans boosted and desire protections related to the use of artificial intelligence, which has become an increasingly prevalent tool for studios and filmmakers.\n\nSAG-AFTRA also pushed for curbs to the practice of self-taped auditions, which actors argue puts undue pressure and costs on performers trying to get work.\n\n\u201cThe AMPTP has remained steadfast in devaluing the work of our members,\u201d said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA\u2019s chief negotiator. \u201cA strike is an instrument of last resort.... Unfortunately, they have left us with no alternative.\u201d\n\nThe AMPTP said it was disappointed, putting the blame on the union. The group said a strike would deepen financial harm for those dependent on the industry, which includes not just writers and actors but also prop warehouses, makeup artists and set designers.\n\nAMPTP said the studios offered the union the \u201chighest percentage increase\u201d in guild minimums in 35 years, limits to self-taped tryouts and substantial increases in pension and health contribution caps, among other proposals. The group said its offers included a 58% increase in salaries for major role (guest star) performers on high-budget streaming programs and a pay increase of at least 11% in Year 1 for background actors, stand-ins and photo doubles.\n\nWalt Disney Co. Chief Executive Bob Iger, in an interview on CNBC, said that the expectations of the writers and actors are \u201cjust not realistic\u201d and that their job actions are \u201cadding to a set of challenges that this business is already facing that is quite frankly very disruptive and dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe union leaders, however, said the AMPTP\u2019s concessions were insufficient. Crabtree-Ireland specifically cited the studios\u2019 AI proposal as offering inadequate safeguards, particularly for background actors. They also chafed at the notion that actors would be to blame for hurting the entertainment economy.\n\n\u201cThis is where we drew the line in the sand, and it\u2019s a terrible thing to have to do,\u201d Drescher said. \u201cBut we were forced into it.\u201d\n\nNegotiations began June 7, ahead of which SAG-AFTRA secured a strike authorization from members with a 98% approval margin.\n\nAhead of the original June 30 deadline, Drescher said in a video message to members that the two sides were having \u201cextremely productive\u201d talks. However, that triggered concern from some of the union\u2019s most high-profile members, including A-list stars, who wrote an open letter to leadership pressuring them not to settle for anything short of a \u201ctransformative\u201d deal.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned by the idea that SAG-AFTRA members may be ready to make sacrifices that leadership is not,\u201d said the letter signed by Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Ben Stiller. \u201cThis is an unprecedented inflection point in our industry, and what might be considered a good deal in any other years is simply not enough.\u201d\n\nThe union was not able to secure a deal before last month\u2019s deadline and extended the contract by 12 days to allow negotiations to continue until 11:59 p.m. July 12.\n\nEarlier this week, the AMPTP requested assistance from a federal mediator, which SAG-AFTRA agreed to. But the relationship between the two sides appeared to have soured.

Interviews with people close to the negotiations cited a series of roadblocks that made a deal next to impossible to achieve during just 35 days of bargaining.

Union leaders made last-ditch calls to studio heads \u2014 including Netflix Chief Executive Ted Sarandos, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav and Walt Disney Co.\u2019s co-entertainment chiefs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman \u2014 to plead with them to break the logjam, said sources close to the negotiations who were not authorized to comment.\n\nBy early Thursday morning, Disney chief Bob Iger appeared on business news channel CNBC and accused actors and writers of \u201cnot being realistic\u201d in their demands.\n\nHe articulated a widely held view of studio heads: Writers and actors have refused to recognize harsh economic realities facing entertainment companies amid profound shifts in consumer behavior.\n\nThe AMPTP, which negotiates on behalf of the companies, said Thursday that it \u201cpresented a deal that offered historic pay and residual increases\u201d and other protections, including on the use of artificial intelligence. \u201cThe union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry.\u201d\n\nMembers of SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America say it\u2019s the AMPTP media companies, including Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Global, Amazon Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment, that fail to grasp the realities facing Hollywood\u2019s working class \u2014 which have deteriorated in the streaming era.\n\nThat was the message Drescher and other union leaders delivered at the union\u2019s Wilshire Boulevard headquarters Thursday when they announced the decision to strike.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t stand tall right now, we are all going to be in trouble,\u201d Drescher said. \u201cWe are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines and big business who cares more about Wall Street than you and your family. At some point, you\u2019ve got to say \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Friday\u2019s walkout, scripted film and television production will grind to a halt.\n\nAnalysts predict the economic damage reverberating throughout Los Angeles due to simultaneous strikes by writers and actors will be enormous and could forever change the entertainment industry. Some studio executives are predicting the strikes could stretch into the fall.\n\nSuch a bleak scenario appeared unlikely only a few weeks ago after Drescher stood alongside SAG-AFTRA\u2019s chief negotiator, National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, at the Sherman Oaks headquarters of the AMPTP to deliver her video message to members.\n\nOn that Saturday night, Drescher appeared to be painting an overly rosy picture of the negotiations because, at that point, there hadn\u2019t been any substantial movement by either side on pivotal deal points, according to people close to the negotiations.\n\nIn fact, the day before the video was recorded, talks had grown contentious when SAG-AFTRA pressed what it felt was an important demand. The union wanted streaming companies, including Netflix, Disney and Amazon, to share with the performers the revenue generated through subscriptions, the knowledgeable people said.\n\nSAG-AFTRA had asked that 2% of the streaming revenue be distributed to performers who appeared in their most successful movies and shows. Because streaming companies have refused to provide precise viewership data with producers and other creatives, SAG-AFTRA suggested using data from a third party, such as Parrot Analytics, to measure the popularity of streaming programs.\n\nThat always was a non-starter for streaming companies, which noted Parrot Analytics largely measures social media conversations that gauge interest in a program \u2014 not actual viewership. And they refused to budge on giving show creators the actual audience numbers.\n\nOn Thursday, Drescher was asked about her sanguine tone during the June 24 video.\n\nShe said she went into negotiations thinking a deal was within reach, but \u201cthey weren\u2019t really ready to get to the core issues,\u201d she said.\n\nThe video triggered an avalanche within SAG-AFTRA. Hundreds of A-listers \u2014 including Meryl Streep, Amy Schumer, Jennifer Lawrence and John Leguizamo \u2014 wrote an open letter to the union\u2019s leadership, applying added pressure. Their message: Do not stop short of anything less than a \u201ctransformative\u201d deal.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned by the idea that SAG-AFTRA members may be ready to make sacrifices that leadership is not,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThis is an unprecedented inflection point in our industry, and what might be considered a good deal in any other years is simply not enough.\u201d\n\nSAG-AFTRA leaders extended negotiations beyond the original June 30 deadline to July 12. Negotiators on both sides took just one day off from the bargaining \u2014 July 4.\n\nStudio insiders groused about the sheer volume of SAG-AFTRA proposals that needed negotiating. Union leaders put dozens of proposals on the table, according to knowledgeable people. Some complained that SAG-AFTRA filled the negotiation room with more than 30 members of its negotiation team \u2014 causing delays in meetings and decision-making.\n\nDrescher and Crabtree-Ireland disputed the claim that they did not prioritize the demands, saying studio responses were tone-deaf and \u201cinsulting.\u201d\n\nMany of the union\u2019s concerns revolved around how profits are shared in Hollywood and union members\u2019 ability to sustain a living in the profession. The union has argued that outdated contract terms, coupled with shorter seasons and longer hiatuses between seasons make it increasingly hard for many actors to maintain a middle-class lifestyle.\n\n\u201cThe entire business model has been changed by streaming, digital, AI,\u201d Drescher said. \u201cYou cannot keep being dwindled and marginalized, and disrespected and dishonored.\u201d\n\nAt the negotiating table, there was little movement, particularly over key issues including wages. SAG-AFTRA had initially demanded basic rate increases of 15% in the first year of the contract \u2014 triple the amount that Directors Guild of America members accepted in an agreement reached last month with the studios. SAG-AFTRA eventually lowered the raise to 12%. On Wednesday, the guild suggested 11% in the first year.\n\nSAG-AFTRA complained that 5% didn\u2019t keep up with inflation. The studios were not moved.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe it, quite frankly, how far apart we are on so many things,\u201d Drescher said.\n\nMuch of the disagreement centered on residuals, the fees paid out when shows or movies are re-aired after their initial broadcast. With international distribution becoming a dominant form of revenue, SAG-AFTRA hoped to bolster the residual formula and have residuals reflect the success of shows.\n\nAnother major sticking point was the use of artificial intelligence, which \u201chas already proven to be a real and immediate threat to the work of our members and can mimic members\u2019 voices, likenesses and performances,\u201d SAG-AFTRA has said.\n\nAMPTP offered what it called a groundbreaking proposal that it said \u201cprotects performers\u2019 digital likenesses, including a requirement for performer\u2019s consent for the creation and use of digital replicas or for digital alterations of a performance.\u201d\n\nBut SAG-AFTRA negotiators noted that companies could scan the initial performance of a background actor and then reuse the image without their consent indefinitely.\n\n\u201cThey would \u2018own\u2019 you for the rest of eternity,\u201d said one person close to the SAG-AFTRA negotiating team who was not authorized to comment.\n\nAMPTP members said the claim was inaccurate. \u201cThey would have control and approval rights over their digital replicas,\u201d according to a studio insider.\n\nEarlier this week, studios scrambled to call in a federal mediator to help move talks along. But some \u2014 even those who are close to the AMPTP \u2014 questioned why the studios hadn\u2019t opted for a mediator sooner.\n\n\u201cWe get to the last minute and then all of a sudden they want mediation,\u201d said a source in the SAG-AFTRA camp.\n\nOn Wednesday night, after Drescher and Crabtree-Ireland left empty-handed from their calls with leading executives at Netflix, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery, they returned to the bargaining table with the AMPTP negotiators.\n\nWith just minutes remaining in the contract, the actors told the companies they were prepared to negotiate further, Crabtree-Ireland said.\n\nCrabtree-Ireland said the AMPTP responded that the companies weren\u2019t willing to go forward unless the actors would \u201cact in a civilized manner,\u201d which riled Crabtree-Ireland, who said Thursday that calling a strike is a core legal right of organized labor.\n\nAn AMPTP representative disputed the characterization.", "tiktoken_token_count": 2010, "llama_token_count": 2449}, {"source_name": "Infosecurity Magazine", "author": "Alessandro  Mascellino", "title": "Biden-Harris Administration Secures AI Commitments For Safety", "description": "Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI all joined the initiative", "url": "https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/us-secures-ai-commitments/", "text": "The Biden-Harris Administration has taken a new step towards ensuring the responsible development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology by securing voluntary commitments from leading AI companies.\n\nAs part of the new initiative, Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI have pledged to prioritize safety, security and trust in their AI systems.\n\nTo protect Americans\u2019 rights and safety, the companies have committed to several fundamental principles.

It is vital that AI companies \u2013 especially those working on the most powerful models \u2013 align on common ground and advance thoughtful and adaptable safety practices to ensure powerful AI tools have the broadest benefit possible. This is urgent work and this forum is well-positioned to act quickly to advance the state of AI safety.\u201d\n\nBenchmarks and Best Practices as A Primary Focus\n\nThe objectives for the Forum include:\n\nAdvancing AI safety research to promote responsible development of frontier models, minimize risks, and enable independent, standardized evaluations of capabilities and safety Identifying best practices for the responsible development and deployment of frontier models, helping the public understand the nature, capabilities, limitations, and impact of the technology Collaborating with policymakers, academics, civil society, and companies to share knowledge about trust and safety risks Supporting efforts to develop applications that can help meet society\u2019s greatest challenges, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, early cancer detection and prevention, and combating cyber threats\n\nDuring the Forum's first year, its members will focus on the first three key areas listed above. Their first tasks will include \u201cadvancing technical evaluations and benchmarks, and developing a public library of solutions to support industry best practices and standards.\u201d\n\nThe founding members will establish an advisory board \u201cover the coming months\u201d to help guide the Forum\u2019s strategy and priorities.\n\nRead more: EU Passes Landmark Artificial Intelligence Act\n\nIn the joint statement, Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, insisted on the responsibility of AI developers: \u201cCompanies creating AI technology have a responsibility to ensure that it is safe, secure, and remains under human control.

Engagement by companies, governments, and civil society will be essential to fulfill the promise of AI to benefit everyone.\u201d\n\nDario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, used a similar language: \u201cWe are excited to collaborate with industry, civil society, government, and academia to promote safe and responsible development of the technology. The Frontier Model Forum will play a vital role in coordinating best practices and sharing research on frontier AI safety.\u201d\n\nIs Self-Regulation a Diversion from Strict Regulation?\n\nThe announcement came six days after the White House secured a voluntary commitment to AI safety from the four members of the Frontier Model Forum as well as Amazon, Inflection AI and Meta.\n\nWhile they promised to mention when contents are AI-generated and to allow independent audits on their models, some analysts criticized the fact that they didn\u2019t commit to transparency on their models\u2019 training.\n\nEncode Justice, an NGO promoting a \u201chuman-centered artificial intelligence,\u201d raised concerns about these self-regulating initiatives and insisted it shouldn\u2019t take the conversation away from stricter, independent regulation. \u201cWhile a promising follow-up to last week's commitments, Big Tech companies' announcement today of the Frontier Model Forum means little without concrete steps and new norms for AI safety. Self-regulation is no substitute for government action,\u201d the NGO said on Twitter.\n\nAndrew Strait, associate director of the UK-based Ada Lovelace Institute, shares the NGO\u2019s concern. On Twitter, he dismissed the term \u2018frontier model,\u2019 saying it\u2019s \u201can undefinable moving-target term that excludes the existing models from governance, regulation, and attention.\u201d\n\nKris Shrishak, a senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), also criticized the initiative: \u201cA Forum of companies that have failed in responsible development of AI systems of \u2018non-frontier\u2019 models will now be responsible for \u2018frontier models\u2019?

We spoke to him about the strike.", "url": "https://jacobin.com/2023/07/adam-conover-wga-strike", "text": "Adam Conover didn\u2019t realize just how precarious a position television writers were in until he was, technically, their boss. It was 2020, and the stand-up comedian had just sold The G Word, his second television show, to Netflix. Conover was a writer and member of the Writers Guild of America (WGA) West union, but he was also one of the show\u2019s executive producers. One day, as the production staff discussed the writing calendar for the limited series and how many writers they planned to hire, one producer mentioned a benefit that came with partnering with the streaming giant. \u201cHe says, \u2018Hey, good news: because we\u2019re on Netflix, we can do whatever we want with writers: there\u2019s no minimum compensation and there\u2019s no minimum term of employment \u2014 we could hire and fire them by the day if we wanted,\u2019\u201d Conover told me. \u201cHe was talking about how great this was, and other executive producers were like, \u2018That\u2019s wonderful for us!\u2019 But my blood ran cold, because I didn\u2019t realize how poor writers\u2019 terms were for the type of comedy I do \u2014 specifically, it was a comedy/variety show, which has abysmal terms in streaming. We actually have no terms whatsoever, we have no minimums of any sort.\u201d In its counterproposal to the WGA during negotiations for a new three-year contract, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) wants to permanently lock in that lack of minimums for comedy/variety writers. Under the terms sought by the studios, writing for shows like The G Word would be done on a day rate, turning television writing into a true gig job with zero security, something a comedian does between stand-up sets. For Conover, the conversation was jarring. (He laughs before noting that The G Word\u2019s most well-known executive producers, Barack and Michelle Obama, were not in the room during the conversation.) He learned a basic reality from the discussion: flexibility for producers meant precarity for writers. Conover hadn\u2019t yet been a WGA member during the previous strike in 2007, but the comedian knew that it was only because of that work stoppage that streaming services were covered by the union contract work at all. Yet the conversation with his fellow producers made it clear that there was a long way to go. His first television show, Adam Ruins Everything, had aired on truTV, a small channel on basic cable, but the residuals from that project had kept him afloat. There was no such safety net at Netflix. \u201cGoing back even before the 2007 strike, the only reason residuals exist is because SAG-AFTRA [the Screen Actors Guild\u2013American Federation of Television and Radio Artists] and the WGA went on strike in 1960, and the same is true of our health and pension plan,\u201d says Conover. \u201cBeing in that situation, where I\u2019m making a show for Barack fucking Obama on the biggest platform in the world and they could pay me $1 a day and hire and fire by the day if they wanted to \u2014 and not only that, but I\u2019m asking writers from my old show to join me on the new one with terms that are much worse? All of that made it obvious that right now is our turn to go on strike to win gains for ourselves but also for the writers of the future.\u201d\n\nGetting Involved Conover is one of the most recognizable faces of the current twelve-thousand-member strong WGA strike. He is a negotiating committee member and serves on the WGA West board of directors, and since the strike began on May 2, Conover has been inescapable to anyone following the action. On social media, he posts a constant stream of videos, many of them filmed while walking a picket line, explaining everything: the purpose of the AMPTP, which the WGA is bargaining against (\u201cto figure out new ways to pay their workers less\u201d); what a strike captain does (checks strikers in for a shift on the picket line, ensures gates are covered to keep productions shut down); and what the strike is about in the first place (\u201cthe survival of film and television writing as a sustainable career\u201d). @adamconover Writers Strike explainer: What is the AMPTP, and what\u2019s their purpose? #WGAStrong \u266c original sound \u2013 Adam Conover On the strike\u2019s first day, it was Conover who criticized the $250 million salary of Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav during an interview on CNN, which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery (\u201cBecause you ruin everything, you may have just ruined my career, but I don\u2019t mind,\u201d joked CNN anchor Sara Sidner as she ended the interview.)

That wasn\u2019t a given: during the 2007 strike, the Hollywood labor movement was less unified, and many productions continued rolling. \u201cWe have the utmost respect for the fact that people are making a sacrifice to make it happen: we have people coming to us saying, \u2018Put up a picket line, we\u2019re not going to cross it and we\u2019re going to help you,\u2019\u201d he says. IATSE members nearly struck the AMPTP in 2021, and the union has seen an influx of organizing by the rank and file, particularly younger members, who are fed up with their own unsustainable working conditions. The Teamsters, too, have undergone a change in leadership with the election of Sean O\u2019Brien. In Los Angeles, Lindsay Dougherty, director of the Teamsters\u2019 Motion Picture Division and president of Local 399, which represents around 6,500 industry workers, has been a stalwart ally of the WGA during the strike. \u201cThe AMPTP has declared war on Hollywood labor, and I promise you, it is a war they are going to get,\u201d said Dougherty at a June 21 WGA rally at the La Brea Tar Pits, near WGA West headquarters. \u201c[AMPTP president Carol Lombardini] didn\u2019t plan on our picket lines being joined by workers from every union in town,\u201d Conover told the crowd in June. \u201cWe have walked with janitors, with housekeepers, with teachers, with strippers, and that is because we know that we are all in it together and we\u2019re all fighting the same fight: for a sustainable job in the face of corporate greed.\u201d @adamconover Honored to speak at the WGA Strong rally last week where THOUSANDS of writers and fellow union members marched in a show of strength and solidarity #WGAStrong \u266c original sound \u2013 Adam Conover Watching him speak from the stage, it\u2019s clear that the process has transformed Conover. He was already comfortable in front of the camera \u2014 a stand-up comic and SAG-AFTRA member. And he isn\u2019t new to local politics, having supported Nithya Raman, a Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) member, for Los Angeles City Council in his district. (Conover says that he isn\u2019t one for \u201c-isms,\u201d adding, \u201cI like to think that I\u2019m in common cause with DSA, for instance, but I don\u2019t go to their meetings.\u201d) But taking on a public role in a nationwide strike is something else entirely. Conover calls it \u201can area of personal growth.\u201d \u201cPeople are looking to me for leadership, and I\u2019m actually able to deliver it in a way that feels comfortable and that they appreciate,\u201d he says, but not before noting that that there are many other leaders in the union doing important work behind the scenes: Raphael Bob-Waksberg, for instance, another member of the WGA West board of directors (and the creator of BoJack Horseman), who spends hours a day poring over a spreadsheet to direct other board members to picket lines across Los Angeles; or Ellen Stutzman, the WGA\u2019s chief negotiator. As for Conover, he\u2019s busy. The day we spoke, his morning had begun with picketing outside of Netflix at 9:00 a.m. \u2014 he estimates that he spends around three hours a day picketing. A WGA West board meeting was scheduled after. \u201cIt\u2019s very hectic,\u201d he says. Plus, Conover is currently on a stand-up tour, performing at shows that were booked before the strike began. While his stand-up material isn\u2019t about the strike, he says that at meet and greets after each stop of the tour, people constantly bring up the strike, wishing him and his fellow writers luck. Being so closely associated with the strike is undoubtedly made easier by the near-universal agreement among writers that this contract marks an inflection point, with the future of their ability to survive in the industry at stake. \u201cI\u2019m very cognizant that I\u2019m playing this role under extremely favorable conditions because the guild is so united,\u201d says Conover. \u201cIt would be a lot less comfortable to do it if it was during an action that there was internal dissent about or if the public perception weren\u2019t so positive. I\u2019m doing it all with tailwinds.\u201d The WGA has had moments of internal dissension in its recent past. In 2019, the union took on the Association of Talent Agencies (ATA) over packaging fees and relationships with studios that the writers said amounted to conflicts of interest: writers hired agents to represent them, but their representatives were being paid by the bosses. The campaign, which involved writers firing their agents, proved successful, building the foundation for the union to confidently wage its current strike. But it was originally controversial among the membership. Conover had become a full WGA member in 2016, and he supported the agency campaign. His desire to see it through led him to become more active in the union. Some members of the guild were loudly opposed to the campaign, and the union held hours-long meetings about it in ballrooms at union hotels in Los Angeles. Any member could approach the microphone and argue the case. \u2018The face-to-face conversation is the atomic unit of politics, and the [union] is nothing but ten thousand face-to-face conversations every day.\u2019 \u201cI thought, \u2018The people on stage are making a good case, but I think I can make an even better one \u2014if I just sit next to the microphone, I can be one of the first to speak and I can talk to five hundred people in this meeting,\u2019\u201d remembers Conover. He went to three meetings across the city, repeating his case to fellow members. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, this is fucking democracy,\u2019\u201d says Conover. \u201cI started to see the parallels between that and national democracy in a really direct way. The face-to-face conversation is the atomic unit of politics, and the guild is nothing but ten thousand face-to-face conversations every day.\u201d Not long after the campaign ended in victory, a friend who was a former labor organizer and had written for one of Conover\u2019s shows nominated him for the WGA West board. Comedy/variety writers, with some of the weakest protections of any television category, were underrepresented in union leadership; Conover felt it was a reason to step up. He asked outgoing WGA West president David A. Goodman for support and received his endorsement. In 2022, Conover was elected to the board. It was less than a year before the contract expired.", "tiktoken_token_count": 2563, "llama_token_count": 2895}, {"source_name": "Help Net Security", "author": "Helga Labus", "title": "US companies commit to safe, transparent AI development", "description": "Seven US artificial intelligence (AI) giants \u2013 Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI \u2013 have publicly committed to \u201chelp move toward safe, secure, and transparent development of AI technology.\u201d The commitments \u201cCompanies that are d\u2026", "url": "https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2023/07/24/us-safe-ai/", "text": "Seven US artificial intelligence (AI) giants \u2013 Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI \u2013 have publicly committed to \u201chelp move toward safe, secure, and transparent development of AI technology.\u201d\n\nThe commitments\n\n\u201cCompanies that are developing these emerging technologies have a responsibility to ensure their products are safe.

Of course they should!\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cPublic awareness around validation of information sourced from the Internet is a must,\u201d notes James Campbell, CEO, Cado Security.\n\n\u201cAn issue with LLMs in particular is that they deliver information in an authoritative manner which is often incorrect (described as \u2018hallucinations\u2019). This results in users of these LLMs believing they have intimate knowledge of a subject area even on occasions where they\u2019ve been misled. Users of LLMs need to approach the results of their prompting with a large dose of scepticism and additional validation from an alternative source. Government guidance to users should emphasise this until the results are more reliable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018testing\u2019 referred to in the release is likely around both the internal security of AI developers and the broader societal impact of the technologies themselves,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of potential for privacy issues arising from the use of AI technologies, especially around Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. OpenAI themselves disclosed a vulnerability in ChatGPT that inadvertently provided access to other users\u2019 conversation titles. Clearly this has serious data security implications for users of these LLMs. More generally, companies may be asked to conduct a risk assessment from a societal impact perspective prior to releasing AI-enabled technologies.\u201d\n\nBut, according to Abnormal Security CISO Mike Britton, when finally enacted, the most significant regulation will be around ethics, transparency and assurances in how the AI operates.\n\n\u201cAny good AI solution should also enable a human to make the final decision when it comes to executing (and potentially undoing) any actions taken by AI,\u201d he told Help Net Security.\n\nWorking on safe, trustworthy and ethical AI systems\n\nThe Administration has previously published a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, aimed at protecting US citizens from risks that AI systems may pose, such as bias and discrimination.\n\nThey identified five principles that guide the design, use, and deployment of such systems:\n\nProtection from unsafe or ineffective systems\n\nProtection from algorithmic discrimination\n\nData privacy protection\n\nNotice and explaination about the systems used\n\nAvailability of a human alternative to automated systems\n\nTo protect the public from algorithmic discrimination, President Biden has signed an Executive Order to urge federal agencies to combat bias in the development and implementation of emerging technologies, such as AI.\n\nWith the intention to bolster AI research and development, the Administration also invested $140 million into the National Science Foundation to launch seven new National AI Research Institutes (adding to the existing 18).", "tiktoken_token_count": 1030, "llama_token_count": 1286}, {"source_name": "Vanity Fair", "author": "Chris Murphy", "title": "Meryl Streep, Quinta Brunson, and Hundreds More Actors \u00a0\"Are Prepared To Strike\u201d", "description": "A letter signed by A-list actors urges SAG-AFTRA leadership to take a firm stance in contract negotiations as a potential strike looms.", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/06/meryl-streep-quinta-brunson-and-hundreds-more-actors-are-prepared-to-strike", "text": "Screen actors are coming together to send a message to their union ahead of a potential SAG-AFTRA strike.

We were glad to see SAG-AFTRA lead the way among the guilds in identifying AI as a threat to our livelihoods that must be addressed right now, a \u201cgame changer.\u201d We felt as though you understood how wildly our pay and our residuals have been undermined, how long we\u2019re being held between seasons. We\u2019ve been filled with pride watching the union come together and deliver such an incredibly strong strike authorization vote.\n\nBut solidarity demands honesty, and we need to make clear our resolve. A strike brings incredible hardships to so many, and no one wants it. But we are prepared to strike if it comes to that. And we are concerned by the idea that SAG-AFTRA members may be ready to make sacrifices that leadership is not. We hope you\u2019ve heard the message from us. This is an unprecedented inflection point in our industry, and what might be considered a good deal in any other years is simply not enough. We feel that our wages, our craft, our creative freedom, and the power of our union have all been undermined in the last decade. We need to reverse those trajectories. With inflation and continued growth in streaming, we need a seismic realignment of our minimum pay and new media residuals, our exclusivity carveouts, and other terms. We also think it\u2019s absolutely vital that the deal restore dignity to the casting process by regulating how self-tapes are used. This is an enormous problem for working class actors. And especially as regards Artificial Intelligence, we do not believe that SAG-AFTRA members can afford to make halfway gains in anticipation of that more will be coming in three years, and we think it is absolutely vital that this negotiation protects not just our likenesses, but makes sure we are well compensated when any of our work is used to train AI. We want you to know that we would rather go on strike than compromise on these fundamental points, and we believe that, if we settle for a less than transformative deal, the future of our union and our craft will be undermined, and SAG-AFTRA will enter the next negotiation with drastically reduced leverage.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1054, "llama_token_count": 1233}, {"source_name": "AdExchanger", "author": "Anthony Vargas", "title": "WaPo\u2019s New Ads Chief Says AI Can Bring Brands And The News Back Together", "description": "The Washington Post is looking to capitalize on a resurgence in advertiser interest in news content, and the AI trend, to create new opportunities for brand collaborations.\nThe post WaPo\u2019s New Ads Chief Says AI Can Bring Brands And The News Back Together appe\u2026", "url": "http://www.adexchanger.com/the-sell-sider/wapos-new-ads-chief-says-ai-can-bring-brands-and-the-news-back-together/", "text": "The Washington Post is at an inflection point.\n\nIt saw a surge in traffic from news-hungry audiences during the Trump administration and COVID-19 pandemic. But somewhat less interesting times means smaller audiences, and WaPo\u2019s ad revenue (in addition to its subscription business) has suffered.\n\nThe WaPo ad tech unit, called Zeus, which for years has been a focal point, recently ceased third-party licensing. But WaPo does still want to build its own solutions for targeting, measurement, contextual advertising and brand suitability.\n\nWaPo has a turnaround plan, which has meant several new executive appointments this week, including the publication\u2019s first-ever chief advertising officer, Johanna Mayer-Jones.\n\nMayer-Jones has been WaPo\u2019s head of North American client partnerships since July 2022. And she believes the time is right to capitalize on a resurgence in advertiser interest in news content, and the AI trend, to create new opportunities for brand collaborations.\n\nMayer-Jones spoke with AdExchanger.\n\nAdExchanger: Why did WaPo decide to create the chief advertising officer position at this time?\n\nJOHANNA MAYER-JONES: It\u2019s a reflection of how important advertising is, not just as a revenue source but in how we prioritize client relationships. We also announced our new CRO, Alex MacCallum, and our new CTO, Vineet Khosla. We have an opportunity to combine a client-advertising-first approach with their experience in product development and consumer revenue.\n\nWaPo has been losing subscribers, and impressions are down compared to 2020 for news publishers. Do these recent hires represent a new regime?\n\nOur legacy is policy and politics coverage. But we\u2019ve invested in wellness and travel and put 11,000 recipes online. We have the only dedicated full-time disability and accessibility reporter in America. We have a new style section launching in September.\n\nWe\u2019ve had to rethink how we work with partners, whether that\u2019s through affiliate marketing, dedicated verticals or new audience products. Now, it\u2019s not just about how you want to reach our audience. It\u2019s about what can we build together.\n\nNews is a tough sell for some advertisers. How is WaPo overcoming brand safety concerns?\n\nBecause of the rise of misinformation, news has a different role to play. Advertisers are looking for trusted environments and quality data, and we\u2019re seeing a flight back to news. We provide qualified audiences and safe adjacencies.\n\nWe\u2019re building a new brand suitability tool. The idea of negative keyword targeting is quite rudimentary, and we\u2019re using our ML and AI tools to take this to a more sophisticated level.\n\nHow will those tools work?\n\nI\u2019d like to save that for a follow-up conversation. We\u2019re also on the cusp of launching new audience targeting and performance measurement tools.\n\nWaPo discontinued licensing its Zeus ad tech at the end of last year. What\u2019s the current state of Zeus?\n\nThe next iteration of Zeus is part of our future story around ad targeting and brand suitability.\n\nAre there still other publishers using Zeus? If so, how many?\n\nI can\u2019t comment on that or share that number.\n\nWhere are you seeing the most strength in your ad business?\n\nWe\u2019re seeing growth in live events, content and in our international business. Over the last few months, growth in consumer-based audiences has been better than B2B audiences.\n\nWe started the year in Davos [at the World Economic Forum], and we could see momentum building around AI. There\u2019s been a rush for trusted information about AI and opportunities for partners to get involved, so we have a new AI subsection, an AI Summit live event and an AI help desk video series.\n\nThe pullback in ad spending because of recession fears was a big topic over the past year, but it seems to have dissipated. Have you seen any changes in how advertisers are spending?\n\nWe are experiencing challenges in some of our biggest sectors, like tech and finance. That\u2019s consistent across the industry. But we\u2019re seeing green shoots of growth in our consumer sectors, like travel and luxury, and there\u2019s some momentum in our health care sector. We\u2019ve built teams to meet [the demand] in those growth areas.\n\nWhat we\u2019re experiencing feels in line with the rest of the industry. But we need to innovate on creative ad units and how we use technology.\n\nWhile WaPo is expanding into new coverage, it also recently disbanded some sections, namely the Sunday print magazine and the gaming vertical Launcher. Were these not viable ad products?\n\nThe magazine was shut down, but we\u2019re launching a new style vertical. Our commitment to covering culture, style and fashion continues, but with a digital-first proposition.\n\nLauncher\u2019s content still exists as part of our wider coverage. We\u2019ve also introduced new proprietary games, like Keyword. Our games section is one of our most popular areas, and we see some of our highest engagement there.\n\nHow are you monetizing your games?\n\nGiven Alex MacCallum\u2019s experience [monetizing The New York Times\u2019 gaming vertical], this is an area I can see us playing with. We\u2019re running display ads. But video, pre-roll, building custom games with partners \u2013 all of that is on our road map.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1061, "llama_token_count": 1322}, {"source_name": "RT", "author": "RT", "title": "Big Tech unveils platform to promote \u2018safe\u2019 AI", "description": "Several IT giants came together to ensure best practices in the development of AI Read Full Article at RT.com", "url": "https://www.rt.com/news/580360-google-microsoft-safe-ai/", "text": "IT heavyweights, including Microsoft and Google, launched a forum focusing on safeguards for artificial intelligence projects\n\nMajor players in the AI industry launched a group dedicated to \u201csafe and responsible development\u201d in the field on Wednesday.

When Parliament resumes in September, the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology will study the bill.\n\nAIDA focuses on a multitude of aspects, such as transparency and risk management. However, the government has yet to define many of these aspects. Canada has been particularly slow moving on the bill, as it was first introduced on June 16th, 2022. It may be years before the bill comes to fruition.\n\nThis could raise a multitude of problems given the deployment of AI chatbots in Canada. Canadians can currently access OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.

Since then, it\u2019s upended so many aspects of life \u2014 and threatens to change much more. It\u2019s a central issue in the Hollywood actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 strikes, is being scrutinized by governments around the world and is even drawing parallels to the invention of the nuclear bomb.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happened just in the last two weeks in the world of AI \u2014 brace yourself, it\u2019s a lot.\n\nTop AI news\n\nSeven of the biggest names in AI \u2014 Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI \u2014 voluntarily agreed last week to certain regulations in response to White House pressure. As the New York Times reported:\n\nAs part of the safeguards, the companies agreed to security testing, in part by independent experts; research on bias and privacy concerns; information sharing about risks with governments and other organizations; development of tools to fight societal challenges like climate change; and transparency measures to identify A.I.-generated material.\n\nThis is certainly only the first step of AI regulations in the United States; Senate hearings continue even as this article is published, with some industry leaders even advocating for regulation. Additionally, the White House has indicated its intention to limit foreign nations\u2019 (read: China) ability to obtain certain AI technologies, though details on what that executive order would look like have not yet been released, according to the Times.\n\nIn other big news, Meta has released its Llama 2 (get it, LLM, llama?) in an \u201copen source\u201d form.\n\n\u2026sort of.\n\nArs Technica reports that, while the tool can be used in some commercial applications or by hobbyists (or bad actors, for that matter), it has restrictions that make it not truly open source.\n\nWhether Meta\u2019s move will increase transparency or lead to an increase in disinformation, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\n\nThe answer is probably both, though.\n\nStriking actors and writers rally around shared AI concerns\n\nWhile the Writers Guild of America (WGA) began striking in May, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG AFTRA) joined them a few weeks ago. Both unions have similar demands, asking for streaming residuals, what they consider to be a living wage and, notably, addressing what SAG-AFTRA calls \u201cthe existential threat AI poses to their careers.\u201d\n\nIndeed, these shared concerns over the use of AI in film and TV programs are a sticking point for both unions. While the WGA requests that the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) bans the use of AI writing and rewriting outright, SAG-AFTRA is not seeking a prohibition on AI so much as a request \u201cthat companies consult with [the union] and get approval before casting a synthetic performer in place of an actor,\u201d according to Reuters:\n\nWhile the two sides have negotiated over issues ranging from using images and performances as training data for AI systems to digitally altering performances in the editing room, actors are worried entirely AI-generated actors, or \u201cmetahumans,\u201d will steal their roles. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t a big deal to plan on utilizing AI to replace actors, it would be a no-brainer to put in the contract and let us sleep with some peace of mind,\u201d Carly Turro, an actress who has appeared in television series like \u201cHomeland,\u201d said on a picket line this week. \u201cThe fact that they won\u2019t do that is terrifying when you think about the future of art and entertainment as a career.\u201d\n\nConcerns over the rate at which the industry is embracing AI are not unfounded, with actor Charisma Carpenter raising a red flag after she received an invitation to join Swiss-based Largo.ai\u2019s \u201c100 Actors Program,\u201d which claims it \u201cwill automatically suggest matching characters to producers/directors\u201d and \u201cyou won\u2019t be charged any commission for the roles you secure,\u201d reports Dateline.\n\nAmid all of this, Netflix posted an AI project manager job with an annual salary range of $300,000-900,000.\n\nWhile the work of writers and actors may seem a far cry from our work as communicators, the concerns expressed by fellow storytellers over AI\u2019s influence on their work and livelihoods marks a significant milestone and is considered to be the first time that a creative union has pushed back against the influence of creative automation, according to Time.\n\nMoreover, the ongoing strike is drastically impacting the overhead of PR firms in the industry, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Yet another reminder of the large financial consequences that can arise when your employees aren\u2019t part of discussions around expanded automation use.\n\nAI\u2019s Oppenheimer moment\n\nChristopher Nolan, director of the hit film \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which tells the story of the creation of the nuclear bomb, said that AI engineers are looking to his film to help them work through the moral quandaries of the technologies they\u2019re building.\n\nAs Nolan said in a recent interview with Chuck Todd:\n\nWhen I talk to the leading researchers in the field of AI right now, for example, they literally refer to this as their Oppenheimer moment. They\u2019re looking to his story to say \u201cOK, what are the responsibilities for scientists developing new technologies that may have unintended consequences?\u201d\n\nNolan added that he hoped that people working on artificial intelligence \u201cleave the film with some unsettling questions, some troubling issues.\u201d\n\nReassuring.\n\nAI and business\n\nMicrosoft and Alphabet reported quarterly results this week, highlighting AI investments and how those investments impact growth.\n\nMicrosoft said its investments in Open AI and the integration of generative AI into its products like Bing led to 21% gains in year-over-year operating income for its intelligent cloud business segment, Forbes reported, contributing to its highest quarterly sales ever.\n\nAlphabet also had an incredible quarter, reporting $8 billion in quarterly revenue with its own cloud segment.\n\nAI and the news industry\n\nAI threatens to accelerate the decline of news media in a variety of ways. The risk is so real, many of the country\u2019s most prominent outlets are already readying lawsuits against artificial intelligence purveyors, most notably News Corp and the New York Times.\n\nAs Semafor reports:\n\nMany publishers have begun to experiment with AI tools aimed at making writing more efficient. But executives also worry about threats to everything from their revenue to the very nature of online authority. The most immediate threat they see is a possible shift at Google from sending traffic to web pages to simply answering users\u2019 questions with a chatbot. That nightmare scenario, for Levin, would turn a Food & Wine review into a simple text recommendation of a bottle of Malbec, without attribution.\n\nPublishers are looking to learn from the mistakes of the social media era, where they were paid relatively small sums for the content that powered many of these platforms. Now, they want billions. To get it, they might head to the courtroom where the legal system would be forced to wrestle with thorny and complex copyright issues.\n\nBut AI is seeking to change newsgathering in other ways, too. Google is shopping a tool called Genesis to the country\u2019s biggest newspapers, the New York Times reported. Genesis could serve as a \u201cpersonal assistant for journalists,\u201d the Times said.\n\nWhat exactly that means depends on who you talk to. The Times said that some who heard the sales pitch \u201csaid it seemed to take for granted the effort that went into producing accurate and artful news stories.\u201d But Google said Genesis would not replace journalists, but rather check style and offer headline suggestions.\n\nNotably, this would replace the role of some journalists, including editors, copy editors and audience engagement professionals who perform these tasks.\n\nAI and HR\n\nJob applicants are finding a workaround for AI r\u00e9sum\u00e9 screeners that look for keywords to advance them in the interview process. In a practice known as \u201cwhite fonting,\u201d savvy applicants will copy keywords relevant to the role from the job description into their CV and change the font color to white, reports The Washington Post. While the document will look normal to HR, the applicant tracking system will catch the text and deem the candidate a fit based on the inclusion of these skills.\n\nThis hack arrives at a time when many candidates are looking for work and the applicant pool is high. For HR and comms alike, it\u2019s among the latest reminders that AI may streamline aspects of your workflow, but it can\u2019t replace human judgement and context.\n\nMeanwhile, HR pros looking to fill AI roles are largely concentrated in just four states\u2014California, New York, Texas and Massachusetts, reports Axios:\n\nGenerative AI may produce \u201cwinner-takes-most\u201d economic outcomes, per the authors of the Brookings report, unless the government moves to foster a more broadly distributed AI sector. Report authors Mark Muro, Julian Jacobs and Sifan Liu suggest that a \u201cwidely distributed\u201d expansion of public sector AI research and access to computing to spread AI benefits away from \u201csuperstar cities.\u201d\n\nThis adds a new lens to talent wars that HR pros will want to watch, as the markets that invest heavily in this technology will likely see operational efficiencies and economic shifts sooner than the ones that don\u2019t.\n\nAllison Carter is executive editor of PR Daily.

We were in the heady days of the Internet bubble, with the dot-com crash still a year away, and the founders of this new company had identified an inflection point in the development of technology.\n\nSean Parker and Shawn Fanning hit upon the moment where network speeds and costs dropped so low that high-quality music files could easily be shared between ordinary users, effectively lowering the cost of distribution for this medium to zero. Their application, Napster, provided an easy way for users to take advantage of this, and the response was instant \u2013 within months it had tens of millions of users, an immense number in an era when Internet access was still far from universal.\n\nEnormous amounts of music were transferred over the service, and as well as providing a full catalogue of contemporary popular music, the application became beloved of enthusiasts because it opened up access to music by niche artists, difficult to find albums, and even bootlegs and unreleased tracks.\n\nNapster changed the world of music distribution forever. It pointed a flashing neon finger at a technical reality that many executives in that business would have preferred to ignore \u2013 that digital distribution had become entirely inevitable \u2013 and paved the way first to digital storefronts and ultimately to the streaming services that now dominate that sector. There was just one problem; Napster didn\u2019t have permission from musicians or publishers to distribute their work.\n\nA new technological frontier and the Wild West atmosphere that springs up around it is exciting and innovative, sure \u2013 but it\u2019s also dangerous\n\nThe whole enterprise was built on stolen content. The company itself didn\u2019t send or receive any of that content, but the software it had created was explicitly designed to allow users to do so. When the US courts ordered Napster to start restricting access to infringing material upon being notified of its location, the gig was up; the service was shut down by summer of 2001.\n\nIn retrospect, it feels absolutely wild that Napster was an actual start-up company \u2013 a legal entity, with its creators publicly listed as founders and officers of the company. This was a company with commercial ambitions, whose sole product was a piece of software explicitly designed to be the most efficient way possible to pirate music. It wasn\u2019t even the only one!\n\nFrom AudioGalazy to LimeWire via the likes of Kazaa, there were a bunch of companies built around applications, networks, and protocols that were explicitly designed for music piracy. Networks had reached a point where music distribution was possible, even easy. This technological advancement opened up a whole new landscape, and for a few years in the late 1990s and early 2000s, that landscape was the Wild West.\n\nSome people believed that it would stay that way \u2013 that the advent of zero-cost distribution changed things so fundamentally that old business models would collapse, and music recordings would effectively be forced to become public domain, validating the whole approach taken by companies like Napster.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking and reading a lot about that era lately, because while history may not repeat itself, it does certainly rhyme \u2013 and we\u2019re living through a very similar moment right now. Just as network speeds and capacities inched their way towards the tipping point where they were capable of collapsing the distribution cost of music, so too has progress with generative and predictive machine learning models inched its way painstakingly over the past decade or two until the point where the models\u2019 capabilities hit an inflection point, enabling technical marvels like MidJourney and ChatGPT to exist.\n\nIn retrospect, it feels absolutely wild that Napster was an actual start-up company \u2013 a legal entity, with its creators publicly listed as founders and officers of the company\n\nJust as network capacities created some cultural and commercial inevitabilities that are only really apparent with hindsight, it is probable that generative AI will change a number of industries in very fundamental ways \u2013 which will seem to have been entirely inevitable all along when we look back upon this era in ten years' time.\n\nThe most striking similarity, however, is that we are absolutely in the Wild West era of generative AI. Consequently, we are surrounded by a mix of chancers, outlaws, fast-and-loose entrepreneurs, and wild-eyed philosophising about how This Changes Everything so none of the old rules ought to apply any more.\n\nIt\u2019s a mix that anyone from the Napster era would find very familiar \u2013 and one of the most familiar aspects is that these people aren\u2019t anarchistic characters releasing software and posting screeds from behind a screen of anonymity, hidden from legal consequence. They\u2019re wearing suits and sitting in boardrooms. They\u2019re being interviewed in newspapers and on TV. They\u2019re giving TED talks.\n\nGenerative AI is a major business push, with billions of dollars behind it and names like Microsoft and Adobe fully committed \u2013 none of which changes for a single second the fact that almost all of these models, and certainly all of the major, popular ones, are built on a mountain of stolen content, all supported by the most flimsy of legal justifications.\n\nA new technological frontier and the Wild West atmosphere that springs up around it is exciting and innovative, sure \u2013 but it\u2019s also dangerous. Most of the companies that sprang up to take advantage of the new frontier in media distribution around the turn of the millennium were bankrupt or sold for a pittance within a couple of years, after the legal system caught up and confirmed that yes, new technological frontier or not, you\u2019re still not allowed to run a business whose objective is to make it easier to steal stuff.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the fate that awaits OpenAI or MidJourney (although, to be clear, I\u2019m not not saying that either), but some people in this space are going to get burned.\n\nThat includes companies in the games industry, where getting out in front of their skates on the topic of generative AI is becoming quite a hobby for some people.\n\nGenerative AI is a major business push, with names like Microsoft and Adobe fully committed \u2013 none of which changes the fact that almost all of these models are built on a mountain of stolen content\n\nValve is determined not to be one of those who get burned. The company has hardened up the line it\u2019s taking on AI-generated content in games on Steam \u2013 it won\u2019t approve games which include it. The company says this isn\u2019t an opinionated stance, merely a reflection of legal realities \u2013 and it\u2019s entirely correct in saying so.\n\nThere are many jurisdictions in which the legal status of AI models and of the content they create remains unclear; and there are quite a few in which the status is pretty clear, merely obfuscated by a cloud of wishful thinking from AI enthusiasts. Large AI models are trained on huge amounts of copyrighted data, usually without permission of the copyright holder, and sometimes despite the explicit denial of that permission.\n\nProponents claim that this is no different to an artist walking around a museum and looking at paintings before going home to paint his own work. In reality, it\u2019s been repeatedly demonstrated that most if not all AI models can be persuaded through careful prompting to yield almost exact copies of parts of their training data.\n\nEven if you\u2019ve obfuscated content by storing it as interconnected weights across layers of digital neurons, you\u2019ve still stored it, not merely learned from it as a human would \u2013 and in most cases, the operators of these models don\u2019t have the right either to do that, or to use it as a basis for digital remixing, which is essentially what AI models do.\n\nNew technological frontier or not, you\u2019re still not allowed to run a business whose objective is to make it easier to steal stuff\n\nDepending how courts and legislatures in various places choose to interpret that (and I do not for a single second envy the task of the lawyers and experts who are going to have to try to explain these systems to bemused judges and lawmakers), this will mean that either the models themselves are judged to breach copyright, or that works created with those models are judged to breach copyright, or both.\n\nMaking bets on how rulings and ultimately legislation in major jurisdictions will go on this topic is a fraught business. I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s more likely that the models get in trouble than the works created by them, except where a specifically identifiable breach is shown in the case of a piece of text, image, or audio content \u2013 but a kind of \"guilt by association\" assumption where every product of a copyright-breaching model is considered to also be in breach is certainly not impossible.\n\nFor Valve, and any other distributor, that creates an intolerable risk. They could be found to have sold and distributed copyright-infringing materials, and given the widespread public debates about this aspect of AI, claiming to have been unaware of this possibility may not serve as a defence.\n\nWithout very clear guidelines and case law on this matter in most jurisdictions, distributors have little choice but to reject games with AI-generated content. The moral questions around AI are incredibly important, but irrelevant to this specific issue; the question that\u2019s relevant is the extent to which the distributors have to cover their asses.\n\nThat Valve won\u2019t touch these games should be a wake-up call for everyone in the industry who\u2019s been starry-eyed about the potential for AI to reduce their costs and speed up their development processes \u2013 going too far down that path without absolute legal clarity risks disaster.\n\nLook, I\u2019m far from an AI refusenik or luddite! I\u2019ve written here in the past about how exciting the potential of technologies like LLMs is for games, and I use systems like ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot every day. Wearing my other hat as a university professor, I\u2019m even in the minority of people in my field who encourage students to use ChatGPT as a tool to assist their work. However, the idea that it\u2019s going to be possible to build whole swathes of game content through simple text prompting, rather than needing humans to draw, write, compose, and perform that content, is naive at best and incredibly dangerous at worst.\n\nThat Valve won\u2019t touch these games should be a wake-up call for everyone in the industry who\u2019s been starry-eyed about the potential for AI to reduce their costs and speed up their development processes\n\nCreating content from scratch with a generalised AI \u2013 whether it\u2019s images, text, voiceover audio, or anything else \u2013 is something that no game company should ever be doing. The resulting content is a copyright minefield, with the worst case scenarios involving a developer being found to have illegally included copyrighted material in their game, or to have developed the game using copyrighted material illegally built into a key tool.\n\nIt\u2019s worth asking whether any of the vendors such as Unity which are currently enthusiastically adding generative AI features to their tools are willing to indemnify developers against any legal liability arising from the use of those tools. Perhaps some are \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s brave or foolhardy \u2013 but for the most part, it\u2019s caveat emptor, and there are some insanely big caveats here.\n\nHonestly, even if it\u2019s decided that this content isn\u2019t infringing other people\u2019s copyright, the best case scenario may well be that nobody gets to own the copyright over the resulting content, because it's not deemed to have had sufficient human involvement in its creation. This would result in game assets ending up in the public domain, with the developer losing control over how they are used by others.\n\nGenerative AI is going to revolutionise many fields, and game development is probably going to be one of them \u2013 but not like this. It\u2019s going to be hell of a lot harder than opening a window to a fantastical piece of software that can replace artists, writers, voice actors and musicians and just telling the magic mirror on the wall what you want it to make for you.\n\nGenerative AI is going to revolutionise many fields, and game development is probably going to be one of them \u2013 but not like this\n\nAI systems can be trained on your own content, allowing the streamlining of pipelines for these processes \u2013 letting your artists remix their own artwork, or allowing your writers to use their scripts to train LLM-driven characters that react dynamically to players. These things are harder, requiring you to have a lot of your own content to start with, and to have the expertise to train and operate an AI system on that content, but this seems like a much more likely model for how development pipelines will ultimately integrate these tools.\n\nYet even this isn\u2019t really possible right now \u2013 it\u2019s technically possible, sure, but such systems still rely on a large-scale AI model as their foundation, and the legal status of those underlying models remains incredibly uncertain.\n\nUntil such time as there are models out there which are fully in the clear legally \u2013 either trained entirely on authorised material with a full paper trail, or covered by a new legal framework which permits and controls their use of a wider range of copyrighted material \u2013 companies should be treating AI as a \"look, but don\u2019t touch\" technology.\n\nProgress often puts technological reality out in front of legal and commercial frameworks, and the Wild West that results is exciting and innovative, but also controversial and dangerous \u2013 and like the Wild West we see in games and movies, very much full of outlaws, snake oil salesmen, and a million ways for the unwary and incautious to meet a sticky end. Ultimately, no market of this size and scale will remain the Wild West for long.\n\nCourts and legislatures will drive their railroads through and tame the lands \u2013 and some of the outlaws will get rounded up along the way. In the anarchy of these moments, you should always be asking whether something is too good to be true. A business built on letting people freely share other people\u2019s intellectual property was always too good to be true.

As SAG-AFTRA members, we\u2019ve been impressed over the last few months by how our leadership outlined the unique stakes of the negotiations and the need for a realignment in our industry. We were glad to see SAG-AFTRA lead the way among the guilds in identifying AI as a threat to our livelihoods that must be addressed right now, a \u201cgame changer.\u201d We felt as though you understood how wildly our pay and our residuals have been undermined, how long we\u2019re being held between seasons. We\u2019ve been filled with pride watching the union come together and deliver such an incredibly strong strike authorization vote.\n\nBut solidarity demands honesty, and we need to make clear our resolve. A strike brings incredible hardships to so many, and no one wants it. But we are prepared to strike if it comes to that. And we are concerned by the idea that SAG-AFTRA members may be ready to make sacrifices that leadership is not. We hope you\u2019ve heard the message from us. This is an unprecedented inflection point in our industry, and what might be considered a good deal in any other years is simply not enough. We feel that our wages, our craft, our creative freedom, and the power of our union have all been undermined in the last decade. We need to reverse those trajectories. With inflation and continued growth in streaming, we need a seismic realignment of our minimum pay and new media residuals, our exclusivity carveouts, and other terms. We also think it\u2019s absolutely vital that the deal restore dignity to the casting process by regulating how self-tapes are used. This is an enormous problem for working class actors. And especially as regards Artificial Intelligence, we do not believe that SAG-AFTRA members can afford to make halfway gains in anticipation of that more will be coming in three years, and we think it is absolutely vital that this negotiation protects not just our likenesses, but makes sure we are well compensated when any of our work is used to train AI. We want you to know that we would rather go on strike than compromise on these fundamental points, and we believe that, if we settle for a less than transformative deal, the future of our union and our craft will be undermined, and SAG-AFTRA will enter the next negotiation with drastically reduced leverage.\n\nThis is not a moment to meet in the middle, and it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that the eyes of history are on all of us. We ask that you push for all the change we need and protections we deserve and make history doing it. If you are not able to get all the way there, we ask that you use the power given to you by us, the membership, and join the WGA on the picket lines. For our union and its future, this is our moment. We hope that, on our behalf, you will meet that moment and not miss it.\n\nCheck out the list of signers below, via Rolling Stone\u2026\n\nChris Abbott\n\nAmy Acker\n\nPatrick J Adams\n\nLauren Adams\n\nPaul Adelstein\n\nUzo Aduba\n\nAlex Anfanger\n\nGenevieve Angelson\n\nAmy Aniobi\n\nHale Appleman\n\nAmanda Arcuri\n\nFred Armisen\n\nKevin Bacon\n\nJodi Balfour\n\nTalia Balsam\n\nElizabeth Banks\n\nMatt Barats\n\nSara Bareilles\n\nIke Barinholtz\n\nBritt Baron\n\nShakira Barrera\n\nMax Barsness\n\nTodd Bartels\n\nSarah Beth Bassak\n\nMikie Beatty\n\nAlison Becker\n\nEmma Bell\n\nTroian Bellisario\n\nGregg Bello\n\nFrancis Benhamou\n\nTodd Berger\n\nReed Birney\n\nGus Birney\n\nEphraim Birney\n\nBre Blair\n\nDaniel Blake\n\nRowan Blanchard\n\nRachel Bloom\n\nJosh Bonzie\n\nMegan Boone\n\nJoel Kim Booster\n\nJohn Ross Bowie\n\nJosh Bowman\n\nMac Brandt\n\nKurt Braunholer\n\nJanicza Bravo\n\nKevin Brennan\n\nJordana Brewster\n\nAlison Brie\n\nConnie Britton\n\nJacqueline Brogan\n\nAmanda Brooks\n\nSophina Brown\n\nQuinta Brunson\n\nAynsley Bubbico\n\nRebecca Rose Bulnes\n\nJoe Burch\n\nOwen Burke\n\nDavid Burtka\n\nMatt Bush\n\nRiver Butcher\n\nMichelle Buteau\n\nMegan Byrne\n\nJ Smith Cameron\n\nNeve Campbell\n\nJames Carpinello\n\nKeith Carradine\n\nSam Carson\n\nRafael Casal\n\nGerardo Celasco\n\nWyatt Cenac\n\nChris Chalk\n\nZoe Chao\n\nFrances Chewning\n\nJamie Chung\n\nJessica St Clair\n\nAdelaide Clemens\n\nGlenn Close\n\nJeremy Cohenour\n\nLauren Cook\n\nOlivia Cooke\n\nSarah Cooper\n\nNesta Cooper\n\nRob Corddry\n\nMaddie Corman\n\nTom Costello\n\nJulie Craig\n\nMichael Cram\n\nDavid Cross\n\nAshleigh Cummings\n\nErin Cummings\n\nTim Daly\n\nSam Daly\n\nAlexandra Daniels\n\nBrianne Davis\n\nAriana DeBose\n\nBrooklyn Decker\n\nKathy Deitch\n\nMajandra Delfino\n\nDavid DeSantos\n\nTorrey DeVitto\n\nRosemarie DeWitt\n\nChris Diamantopoulos\n\nDaveed Diggs\n\nMaria Dizzia\n\nKether Donohue\n\nChad Doreck\n\nFiona Dourif\n\nPaul W.

On both coasts, though, there was a buoyant mood in the air as picket lines were reinvigorated by the support of some of the 65,000 actors who comprise SAG-AFTRA (98% of members voted to approve a strike back in June). This is Hollywood\u2019s biggest labor fight in six decades, and the first dual strike since 1960, reigniting the fervor against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers just as a historic heat wave hits Southern California.\n\nOutside the Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, California, throngs of protesters chanted: \u201cFists up, curtains down, LA is a union town.\u201d Food trucks flanking organizers\u2019 tents served churros, boba tea and cold lemonade to protesters baking in the midday heat that reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit (36.7 Celsius).\n\nBut the oppressive sun didn\u2019t dampen the mood. Demonstrators spritzed each other with water and danced to reggaeton music as passersby in cars honked in support of signs like: \u201cHonk if your boss is overpaid.\u201d\n\nParents on the picket line hoisted their children over their shoulders and pushed toddlers in strollers, high-fiving one another with signs that reflected defiant lyrics from Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s new single, \u201cVampire,\u201d and were packing \u201cBig Strike Energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe jig is up,\u201d said Fran Drescher, president of SAG-AFTRA and once the titular star of \u201cThe Nanny\u201d at SAG\u2019s press conference Thursday. \u201cThe entire business model has been changed by streaming, digital, A.I. If we don\u2019t stand tall right now, we\u2019re all going to be in trouble.\u201d\n\nStriking writers and actors picket outside Paramount studios in Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)\n\nThe infusion of SAG members\u2019 support was noted by comedian and writer Adam Conover, a member of SAG and WGA who serves on the latter\u2019s negotiating committee.\n\n\u201cIf you are gaining momentum like we are 70-odd days into a strike, you are going to win,\u201d Conover said. \u201cYou know, the companies\u2019 strategy with the writers guild when we go on strike is to starve us out and wait, not even talk to us for months because they expect us to bleed support. Yet, look at this \u2014 our picket lines are more full than ever and now have another union on strike with us.\u201d\n\nSAG and WGA last went on simultaneous strikes more than six decades ago.\n\n\u201cWhat we won in 1960 was our health and pension plans, and the existence of residuals,\u201d Conover said. Now, executives \u201care facing the fact that not only are they getting no new scripts, they cannot shoot anything until they come back and make a fair deal, not with one union but with both unions.\u201d\n\nZora Bikangaga, also a member of both guilds, called Friday\u2019s picket \u201cinvigorating,\u201d and a testament to how the issues writers are facing are \u201cpervasive across the entire industry.\u201d\n\nWhile the industry\u2019s business model has undergone major changes in the decades since the last strike, actors say their rates and contracts haven\u2019t evolved to match inflation and other changes.\n\n\u201cThey use the gig economy as a way to say, \u2018This is how you can be more independent,\u2019 when in fact what it does is diminish the value and strength of organized labor,\u201d said actor Ron Song, who appeared on Amazon Freevee\u2019s \u201cJury Duty,\u201d which was nominated this week for four Emmys.\n\nFormer co-stars and acquaintances alike reunited at demonstrations. Some hadn\u2019t seen each other since the coronavirus pandemic started more than three years ago.\n\nThe first full day of the dual strike was marked by high energy \u2014 joy and unity mixed with anger and frustration.\n\nFor actor Stacey Travis, who has actively been involved in SAG-AFTRA for years, the decision to strike was not taken lightly.\n\n\u201cIt feels extraordinary and it feels sad,\u201d she said of the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult on everyone, so we\u2019ve always taken it incredibly seriously. So it\u2019s only when we\u2019re backed up against the wall and we have no options that we find ourselves here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all of it for me,\u201d said actor Peter Carellini about the reason for striking. \u201cIt\u2019s A.I. It\u2019s residuals. It\u2019s the fact that Bob Chapek, Bob Iger, David Zaslav are making untold millions in bonuses while writers and actors are going to the Emmys with negative bank accounts.\u201d", "tiktoken_token_count": 997, "llama_token_count": 1190}, {"source_name": "Thenation.com", "author": "Sasha Abramsky", "title": "Hollywood\u2019s Robot Overlords", "description": "Sasha Abramsky\n\nThe tech-driven takeover of the film industry aims at squeezing maximum profit out of art, draining it of all its humanity in the process.\nThe post Hollywood\u2019s Robot Overlords appeared first on The Nation.", "url": "https://www.thenation.com/?post_type=article&#038;p=452008", "text": "Merrick Garland Is Letting Texas Get Away With Sadism Merrick Garland Is Letting Texas Get Away With Sadism\n\nThe DOJ has chosen to look away as GOP governors like Greg Abbott treat migrants as political punching bags who can be bashed for the amusement of white nationalist voters.\n\nJul 27, 2023 / Elie Mystal", "tiktoken_token_count": 69, "llama_token_count": 93}, {"source_name": "Securityweek.com", "author": "AFP", "title": "Tech Titans Promise Watermarks to Expose AI Creations", "description": "Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and other tech firms have voluntary agreed to AI safeguards set by the White House.\nThe post Tech Titans Promise Watermarks to Expose AI Creations appeared first on SecurityWeek.", "url": "https://www.securityweek.com/tech-titans-promise-watermarks-to-expose-ai-creations/", "text": "The White House said Friday that OpenAI and others in the artificial intelligence race have committed to making their technology safer with features such as watermarks on fabricated images.\n\n\u201cThese commitments, which the companies have chosen to undertake immediately, underscore three principles that must be fundamental to the future of AI \u2014 safety, security, and trust \u2014 and mark a critical step toward developing responsible AI,\u201d the White House said in a release.\n\nRepresentatives from Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI were to join US President Joe Biden later Friday to announce the commitments, which include developing \u201crobust technical mechanisms\u201d such as watermarking systems to ensure that users know when content is AI-generated, according to a White House official.\n\nWorry that imagery or audio created by artificial intelligence will be used for fraud and misinformation has ramped up as the technology improves and the 2024 US presidential election gets closer.\n\nWays to tell when audio or imagery have been generated artificially are being sought to prevent people from being duped by fakes that look or sound real.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re committing to setting up a broader regime towards making it easier for consumers to know whether content is AI-generated or not,\u201d the White House official said.\n\n\u201cThere is technical work to be done, but the point here is that it applies to audio and visual content, and it will be part of a broader system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement.

Sag-Aftra has around 160,000 members: actors in film and TV shows, as well as video game performers, radio presenters, models and YouTube influencers. Technically the union only covers the US, but its Global Rule One demands that members pull out of any production anywhere in the world.\n\nWho is Sag-Aftra\u2019s firebrand leader?\n\nThe union\u2019s president and figurehead is Fran Drescher, who you might remember from 90s TV show The Nanny. Having faced down a modicum of criticism for shooting off to Italy for a photoshoot with Kim Kardashian as negotiations were heading for the rocks, Drescher stormed back with an incendiary speech, in which she poured scorn on studio bosses (\u201cThey plead poverty, that they\u2019re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs. It is disgusting. Shame on them.\u201d) and invoked the spirit of the French Revolution: \u201cEventually, the people break down the gates of Versailles, and then it\u2019s over!\u201d\n\n02:28 Fran Drescher delivers fiery speech against Hollywood studios as actors strike \u2013 video\n\nWho are the major supporting players?\n\nA preview of the A-listers putting their star-wattage behind the strike came a fortnight ago when a Sag-Aftra letter expressing willingness to strike was signed by the likes of Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence, Charlize Theron, Joaquin Phoenix, Jamie Lee Curtis, Olivia Wilde and Ewan McGregor. On Friday, George Clooney added his weight to the strike, calling it \u201can inflection point in our industry\u201d, and saying that change was required for \u201cour industry to survive\u201d. Other big hitters to lend their support over the past 24 hours include John Cusack and Mark Ruffalo. There have been no holdouts \u2013 all US actors appear to be on board with the action.\n\nWhat does Sag-Aftra want? And why can\u2019t they get it?\n\nOne of the union\u2019s main roles is to negotiate terms with the studios: the last major agreement was signed in July 2020 though it was almost immediately undermined by Covid. That agreement was due to expire on 30 June, hence the start of negotiations. One of the main sticking points appears to be residuals, the payments that performers receive for repeat showings of films or TV shows, while the issue of who owns an actor\u2019s likeness if it is reproduced by AI is also a major flashpoint. Sag-Aftra negotiators are demanding residuals partly based on viewership levels on streaming services but the studios \u2013 which include streamers Netflix and Amazon alongside Disney \u2013 aren\u2019t willing to share the information.\n\nA Writers Guide America placard \u2026 AI has also been an issue in their dispute. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nHas streaming changed everything?\n\nStreaming hasn\u2019t just killed the mid-budget movie, or the linear TV series, it\u2019s also changed the way films and shows are presented to their audience, and extract money from them in return. Streamers make money from subscribers, and the shows and films are essentially promos for the subscriptions. Plus they are just up there permanently, with no \u201crepeats\u201d as we would understand them \u2013 classic \u201cdisruption\u201d, which makes it hard for traditional means of assessing their value in terms of paying people for them. Hence the argument over residuals, made all the harder by the streamers\u2019 reluctance to reveal how many people watch them. As shows and films on streaming platforms become ever larger and more widely watched, then the potential residuals become an ever more significant amount.\n\nWhat about AI?\n\nSix months ago, no one gave AI a second thought, but that\u2019s how fast things have moved: from zero to an existential threat. Right now, AI-generated imagery doesn\u2019t seem quite sophisticated enough to replace traditional film-making wholesale, but the speed of machine-learning has got everyone worried. The AMPTP said it had offered a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d proposal over AI, but Sag-Aftra\u2019s chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland batted that one away: \u201cThey proposed that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get one day\u2019s pay, and their companies should own that scan, their image, their likeness and should be able to use it for the rest of eternity on any project they want, with no consent and no compensation. So if you think that\u2019s a groundbreaking proposal, I suggest you think again.\u201d\n\nI thought actors were rich, though?\n\nActing is a bit like the sports world: there\u2019s a bunch of big-money headliners, and then the rest, some of whom earn decent money, but most are on nothing like it. These are the people on whose behalf Tom Cruise went ballistic during the Mission: Impossible shoot: \u201cYou can tell it to the people that are losing their fucking homes because our industry is shut down! It\u2019s not going to put food on their table or pay for their college education!\u201d Matt Damon reminded reporters of the struggles of most US working actors\u2019 lives: \u201cIt\u2019s $26,000 to qualify for health coverage and a lot of people are on the margins and residual payments are getting them across that threshold. This isn\u2019t an academic exercise. This is real life-and-death stuff.\u201d\n\nMatt Damon with Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh at Thursday\u2019s Oppenheimer premiere. Photograph: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images\n\nWill they get what they want? How strong are the unions?\n\nThe US might be the home of the labour-dispute massacre (about 1,100 deaths since 1850, by Wikipedia\u2019s count) but Sag-Aftra is likely to pack a powerful punch. For one thing, its leading members are much more visible than those of the writers\u2019 union, the WGA, whose strike began in May. And the disappearance of actors means shooting, the most cash-intensive part of the production process, has to stop immediately. But the knock-on effects of the strike aren\u2019t apparent instantly \u2013 this isn\u2019t like refuse or power workers. Both sides are playing a long game: the actors and writers gambling that the product pipeline \u2013 already threadbare after Covid \u2013 will force the studios back to the table, while the bosses are taking the time-honoured route of trying to batter the unions into submission.\n\nWhat will this mean for the UK?\n\nEquity, the UK actors\u2019 union, has said it will \u201cstand in unwavering solidarity\u201d with Sag-Atfra, meaning any of its members who hold joint cards will be loth to work if in doubt, and those who don\u2019t will feel uncomfortable if there\u2019s any sense they are taking work from striking colleagues. Beyond that, many productions on these shores are to a greater or lesser extent co-productions. The UK\u2019s biggest studios host major US productions, all of which are now on hold. These include Deadpool 3, which has been filming at Pinewood, Tim Burton\u2019s Beetlejuice sequel, Idris Elba thriller Heads of State and the film version of Wicked. TV shows in production and now under threat are second seasons of Andor and The Sandman, and Eddie Redmayne\u2019s The Day of the Jackal.\n\n02:05 Hollywood actors walk out of Oppenheimer premiere as strike action starts \u2013 video report\n\nWhat are the other immediate effects?\n\nAs well as halting most shoots, the small print of Sag-Aftra\u2019s terms means actors will no longer be able to promote shows and films they have already made. Hence the moving forward by an hour of the start time of Oppenheimer\u2019s London premiere, so its cast could walk the red carpet before the 8pm deadline. The promotional ban extends to social media, with stars now muzzled about their forthcoming work. It also means chatshows will be strikingly light on actors for the foreseeable and any print or radio interviews scheduled to happen from Friday onwards have been cancelled.\n\nBradley Cooper and Lady Gaga at the 2018 Venice film festival. A return visit will be tricky this year. Photograph: Franco Origlia/GC Images\n\nWhat about in the next few months?\n\nThe most pressing effect is likely to be on the autumn festivals \u2013 Venice, Telluride and Toronto \u2013 which start at the end of next month. All three are heavily reliant on star wattage to launch movies hoping for major Oscar action. Yet without A-listers to promote them \u2013 making splashy canal entrances, dolled up on the red carpet and talking to reporters \u2013 much of the draw of such events will be removed. Venice will need to decide whether it can continue with opening night movie Challengers, for instance, if in-person coverage has to exclusively focus on director Luca Guadagnino rather than stars Zendaya and Josh O\u2019Connor. Other films not officially announced for the autumn festivals will rapidly need to recalibrate their strategies. Michael Mann\u2019s Ferrari film could still screen, but without star Adam Driver. When key roles are combined, the situation is potentially more thorny. Bradley Cooper has written, produced, directed and stars in Leonard Bernstein biopic, Maestro.

The tests are meant to protect against \u201csignificant sources of AI risks,\u201d including biosecurity and cybersecurity risks as well as \u201cbroader societal effects\u201d.\n\nEach of the companies has also agreed to invest in security safeguards to protect \u201cmodel weights\u201d that are proprietary or unreleased, as well as to develop \u201crobust technical mechanisms\u201d to \u201creduce the dangers of fraud and deception\u201d by permitting AI-generated content to be easily identified through technical means such as watermarking.\n\nMr Biden also said the companies\u2019 investment in trustworthy AI technology will include empowering users to detect altered or fake content, as well as \u201crooting out bias and discrimination, strengthening privacy protections and shielding children from harm\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese commitments are real and they're concrete. They're going to help fulfill industry fulfill this fundamental obligation to Americans to develop safe, secure and trustworthy technologies that benefit society and uphold our values,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president said the rise of AI has been an \u201castounding revelation\u201d for him, and predicted that Americans would see more technological change in the next decade than in the previous five, and praised the executives as having \u201ccritical\u201d roles in \u201cshepherding that innovation with responsibility and safety ... to earn the trust of Americans\u201d.\n\n\u201cSocial media has shown us the harm that powerful technology can do without the right safeguards in place ... we must be clear-eyed and vigilant about the threats emerging from emerging technologies that can pose don't have to but can pose to our democracy and our values.

Observers say AI has the potential to upend entire industries, but the powerful nature of the technology has also sparked calls from lawmakers \u2014 and some of the firms themselves \u2014 for more federal regulation to set the rules of the road.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Biden announced several steps that the companies have agreed to take voluntarily.\n\nFirst, the companies have agreed to \"testing the capabilities of their systems, assessing their potential risks, and making the results of these assessments public.\" They will also safeguard their models against cyberthreats, and manage the risk to national security, Mr. Biden said. Third, the companies \"have a duty to earn the people's trust and empower users to make informed decisions, labeling content that has been altered or AI-generated, rooting out bias and discrimination, strengthening privacy protections and shielding children from harm.\" And finally, the companies \"have agreed to find ways for AI to help meet society's greatest challenges, from cancer to climate change,\" the president said.\n\nThe pledges are broad and leave room for interpretation. Some advocates for greater government oversight of AI said the agreements were a good sign, but should still be followed with further regulation.\n\n\"These commitments are a step in the right direction, but, as I have said before, we need more than industry commitments.

In 2023, we learned that a machine taught itself how to speak to humans like a peer. which is to say, with creativity, truth, errors and lies. The technology, known as a chatbot, is only one of the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence -- machines that can teach themselves superhuman skills. In April, we explored what's coming next at Google, a leader in this new world. CEO Sundar Pichai told us AI will be as good or as evil as human nature allows. The revolution, he says, is coming faster than you know.\n\nScott Pelley: Do you think society is prepared for what's coming?\n\nSundar Pichai: You know, there are two ways I think about it. On one hand I feel, no, because you know, the pace at which we can think and adapt as societal institutions, compared to the pace at which the technology's evolving, there seems to be a mismatch. On the other hand, compared to any other technology, I've seen more people worried about it earlier in its life cycle. So I feel optimistic. The number of people, you know, who have started worrying about the implications, and hence the conversations are starting in a serious way as well.\n\nScott Pelley with Google CEO Sundar Pichai 60 Minutes\n\nOur conversations with 50-year-old Sundar Pichai started at Google's new campus in Mountain View, California. It runs on 40% solar power and collects more water than it uses -- high-tech that Pichai couldn't have imagined growing up in India with no telephone at home.\n\nSundar Pichai: We were on a waiting list to get a rotary phone and for about five years. It finally came home I can still recall it vividly. It changed our lives. To me it was the first moment I understood the power of what getting access to technology meant and so probably led me to be doing what I'm doing today.\n\nWhat he's doing, since 2019, is leading both Google and its parent company, Alphabet, valued at $1.5 trillion. Worldwide, Google runs 90 percent of internet searches and 70 percent of smartphones. But its dominance was attacked this past February when Microsoft unveiled its new chatbot. In a race for AI dominance, in March, Google released its version named Bard.\n\nSissie Hsiao: It's really here to help you brainstorm ideas, to generate content, like a speech, or a blog post, or an email.\n\nWe were introduced to Bard by Google Vice President Sissie Hsiao and Senior Vice President James Manyika. The first thing we learned was that Bard does not look for answers on the internet like Google search does.\n\nSissie Hsiao: So I wanted to get inspiration from some of the best speeches in the world...\n\nBard's replies come from a self-contained program that was mostly self-taught\u2014 our experience was unsettling.\n\nScott Pelley: Confounding, absolutely confounding.\n\nBard appeared to possess the sum of human knowledge...\n\n...with microchips more than 100-thousand times faster than the human brain. We asked Bard to summarize the New Testament. It did, in five seconds and 17 words. We asked for it in Latin--that took another four seconds. Then, we played with a famous six word short story, often attributed to Hemingway.\n\nScott Pelley: For sale. Baby shoes. Never worn.\n\nThe only prompt we gave was 'finish this story.' In five seconds\u2026\n\nScott Pelley: Holy Cow! The shoes were a gift from my wife, but we never had a baby\u2026\n\nFrom the six-word prompt, Bard created a deeply human tale with characters it invented -- including a man whose wife could not conceive and a stranger, grieving after a miscarriage, and longing for closure.\n\nScott Pelley: I am rarely speechless. I don't know what to make of this. Give me that story\u2026\n\nWe asked for the story in verse. In five seconds, there was a poem written by a machine with breathtaking insight into the mystery of faith, Bard wrote \"she knew her baby's soul would always be alive.\" The humanity, at superhuman speed, was a shock.\n\nScott Pelley: How is this possible?\n\nJames Manyika told us that over several months, Bard read most everything on the internet and created a model of what language looks like. Rather than search, its answers come from this language model.\n\nBard is demonstrated at Google 60 Minutes\n\nJames Manyika: So, for example, if I said to you, Scott, peanut butter and?\n\nScott Pelley: Jelly.\n\nJames Manyika: Right. So, it tries and learns to predict, okay, so peanut butter usually is followed by jelly. It tries to predict the most probable next words, based on everything it's learned. So, it's not going out to find stuff, it's just predicting the next word.\n\nBut it doesn't feel like that. We asked Bard why it helps people and it replied \u2013 quote \u2013 \"because it makes me happy.\"\n\nScott Pelley: Bard, to my eye, appears to be thinking. Appears to be making judgments. That's not what's happening? These machines are not sentient. They are not aware of themselves.\n\nJames Manyika: They're not sentient. They're not aware of themselves. They can exhibit behaviors that look like that. Because keep in mind, they've learned from us. We're sentient beings. We have beings that have feelings, emotions, ideas, thoughts, perspectives. We've reflected all that in books, in novels, in fiction. So, when they learn from that, they build patterns from that. So, it's no surprise to me that the exhibited behavior sometimes looks like maybe there's somebody behind it. There's nobody there. These are not sentient beings.\n\nZimbabwe born, Oxford educated, James Manyika holds a new position at Google -- his job is to think about how AI and humanity will best co-exist.\n\nJames Manyika: AI has the potential to change many ways in which we've thought about society, about what we're able to do, the problems we can solve.\n\nBut AI itself will pose its own problems. Could Hemingway write a better short story? Maybe. But Bard can write a million before Hemingway could finish one. Imagine that level of automation across the economy.\n\nScott Pelley: A lot of people can be replaced by this technology.\n\nJames Manyika: Yes, there are some job occupations that'll start to decline over time. There are also new job categories that'll grow over time. But the biggest change will be the jobs that'll be changed. Something like more than two-thirds will have their definitions change. Not go away, but change. Because they're now being assisted by AI and by automation. So this is a profound change which has implications for skills. How do we assist people to build new skills? Learn to work alongside machines. And how do these complement what people do today.\n\nJames Manyika 60 Minutes\n\nSundar Pichai: This is going to impact every product across every company and so that's, that's why I think it's a very, very profound technology. And so, we are just in early days.\n\nScott Pelley: Every product in every company.\n\nSundar Pichai: That's right. AI will impact everything. So, for example, you could be a radiologist. You know, if I-- if I-- if you think about five to 10 years from now, you're gonna have a AI collaborator with you. It may triage. You come in the morning. You-- let's say you have 100 things to go through. It may say, 'These are the most serious cases you need to look at first.' Or when you're looking at something, it may pop up and say, 'You may have missed something important.' Why wouldn't we, why wouldn't we take advantage of a super-powered assistant to help you across everything you do? You may be a student trying to learn math or history. And, you know, you will have something helping you.\n\nWe asked Pichai what jobs would be disrupted, he said, \"knowledge workers.\" People like writers, accountants, architects and, ironically, software engineers. AI writes computer code too.\n\nToday Sundar Pichai walks a narrow line. A few employees have quit, some believing that Google's AI rollout is too slow, others--too fast. There are some serious flaws. James Manyika asked Bard about inflation. It wrote an instant essay in economics and recommended five books. But days later, we checked. None of the books is real. Bard fabricated the titles. This very human trait, error with confidence, is called, in the industry, hallucination.\n\nScott Pelley: Are you getting a lot of hallucinations?\n\nSundar Pichai: Yes, you know, which is expected. No one in the, in the field has yet solved the hallucination problems. All models do have this as an issue.\n\nScott Pelley: Is it a solvable problem?\n\nSundar Pichai: It's a matter of intense debate. I think we'll make progress.\n\nTo help cure hallucinations, Bard features a \"Google it\" button that leads to old-fashioned search. Google has also built safety filters into Bard to screen for things like hate speech and bias.\n\nScott Pelley: How great a risk is the spread of disinformation?\n\nSundar Pichai: AI will challenge that in a deeper way the scale of this problem will be much bigger.\n\nBigger problems, he says, with fake news and fake images.\n\nSundar Pichai: It will be possible with AI to create-- you know, a video easily. Where it could be Scott saying something, or me saying something, and we never said that. And it could look accurate. But you know, on a societal scale, you know, it can cause a lot of harm.\n\nScott Pelley: Is Bard safe for society?\n\nSundar Pichai: The way we have launched it today, as an experiment in a limited way, I think so. But we all have to be responsible in each step along the way.\n\nThis past spring, Google released an advanced version of Bard that can write software and connect to the internet. Google says it's developing even more sophisticated AI models.\n\nScott Pelley: You are letting this out slowly so that society can get used to it?\n\nSundar Pichai: That's one part of it. One part is also so that we get the user feedback. And we can develop more robust safety layers before we build, before we deploy more capable models.\n\nOf the AI issues we talked about, the most mysterious is called emergent properties. Some AI systems are teaching themselves skills that they weren't expected to have. How this happens is not well understood. For example, one Google AI program adapted, on its own, after it was prompted in the language of Bangladesh, which it was not trained to translate.\n\nJames Manyika: We discovered that with very few amounts of prompting in Bengali, it can now translate all of Bengali. So now, all of a sudden, we now have a research effort where we're now trying to get to a thousand languages.\n\nSundar Pichai: There is an aspect of this which we call-- all of us in the field call it as a \"black box.\" You know, you don't fully understand. And you can't quite tell why it said this, or why it got wrong. We have some ideas, and our ability to understand this gets better over time. But that's where the state of the art is.\n\nScott Pelley: You don't fully understand how it works. And yet, you've turned it loose on society?\n\nSundar Pichai: Yeah. Let me put it this way. I don't think we fully understand how a human mind works either.\n\nWas it from that black box, we wondered, that Bard drew its short story that seemed so disarmingly human?\n\nScott Pelley: It talked about the pain that humans feel. It talked about redemption. How did it do all of those things if it's just trying to figure out what the next right word is?\n\nSundar Pichai: I have had these experiences talking with Bard as well. There are two views of this. You know, there are a set of people who view this as, look, these are just algorithms. They're just repeating what it's seen online. Then there is the view where these algorithms are showing emergent properties, to be creative, to reason, to plan, and so on, right? And, and personally, I think we need to be, we need to approach this with humility. Part of the reason I think it's good that some of these technologies are getting out is so that society, you know, people like you and others can process what's happening. And we begin this conversation and debate. And I think it's important to do that.\n\nThe revolution in artificial intelligence is the center of a debate ranging from those who hope it will save humanity to those who predict doom. Google lies somewhere in the optimistic middle, introducing AI in steps so that civilization can get used to it. We saw what's coming next in machine learning earlier this year at Google's AI lab in London -- a company called Deepmind -- where the future looks something like this.\n\nScott Pelley: Look at that! Oh, my goodness\u2026\n\nRaia Hadsell: They got a pretty good kick on them...\n\nScott Pelley: Ah! Goal!\n\nA soccer match at DeepMind looks like fun and games but, here's the thing: humans did not program these robots to play--they learned the game by themselves.\n\nRobots powered by AI taught themselves to play soccer. 60 Minutes\n\nRaia Hadsell: It's coming up with these interesting different strategies, different ways to walk, different ways to block\u2026\n\nScott Pelley: And they're doing it, they're scoring over and over again\u2026\n\nRaia Hadsell, vice president of Research and Robotics, showed us how engineers used motion capture technology to teach the AI program how to move like a human. But on the soccer pitch the robots were told only that the object was to score. The self-learning program spent about two weeks testing different moves. It discarded those that didn't work, built on those that did, and created all-stars.\n\nAnd with practice, they get better. Hadsell told us that, independent from the robots, the AI program plays thousands of games from which it learns and invents its own tactics.\n\nRaia Hadsell: Here we think that red player's going to grab it. But instead, it just stops it, hands it back, passes it back, and then goes for the goal.\n\nScott Pelley: And the AI figured out how to do that on its own.\n\nRaia Hadsell: That's right. That's right. And it takes a while. At first all the players just run after the ball together like a gaggle of, you know, 6-year-olds the first time they're playing ball. Over time what we start to see is now, 'Ah, what's the strategy? You go after the ball. I'm coming around this way. Or we should pass. Or I should block while you get to the goal.' So, we see all of that coordination emerging in the play.\n\nScott Pelley: This is a lot of fun. But what are the practical implications of what we're seeing here?\n\nRaia Hadsell: This is the type of research that can eventually lead to robots that can come out of the factories and work in other types of human environments. You know, think about mining, think about dangerous construction work or exploration or disaster recovery.\n\nRaia Hadsell is among 1,000 humans at DeepMind. The company was co-founded just 12 years ago by CEO Demis Hassabis.\n\nDemis Hassabis 60 Minutes\n\nDemis Hassabis: So if I think back to 2010 when we started nobody was doing AI. There was nothing going on in industry. People used to eye roll when we talked to them, investors, about doing AI. So, we couldn't, we could barely get two cents together to start off with which is crazy if you think about now the billions being invested into AI startups.\n\nCambridge, Harvard, MIT, Hassabis has degrees in computer science and neuroscience. His Ph.D. is in human imagination. And imagine this, when he was 12, in his age group, he was the number two chess champion in the world.\n\nIt was through games that he came to AI.\n\nDemis Hassabis: I've been working on AI for decades now, and I've always believed that it's gonna be the most important invention that humanity will ever make.\n\nScott Pelley: Will the pace of change outstrip our ability to adapt?\n\nDemis Hassabis: I don't think so. I think that we, you know, we're sort of an infinitely adaptable species. You know, you look at today, us using all of our smartphones and other devices, and we effortlessly sort of adapt to these new technologies. And this is gonna be another one of those changes like that.\n\nAmong the biggest changes at DeepMind was the discovery that self-learning machines can be creative. Hassabis showed us a game playing program that learns. It's called AlphaZero and it dreamed up a winning chess strategy no human had ever seen.\n\nScott Pelley: But this is just a machine. How does it achieve creativity?\n\nDemis Hassabis: It plays against itself tens of millions of times. So, it can explore parts of chess that maybe human chess players and programmers who program chess computers haven't thought about before.\n\nScott Pelley: It never gets tired. It never gets hungry. It just plays chess all the time.\n\nDemis Hassabis: Yes. It's kind of an amazing thing to see, because actually you set off AlphaZero in the morning and it starts off playing randomly. By lunchtime, you know, it's able to beat me and beat most chess players. And then by the evening, it's stronger than the world champion.\n\nDemis Hassabis sold DeepMind to Google in 2014. One reason, was to get his hands on this. Google has the enormous computing power that AI needs. This computing center is in Pryor, Oklahoma. But google has 23 of these, putting it near the top in computing power in the world. This is one of two advances that make AI ascendant now. First, the sum of all human knowledge is online and, second, brute force computing that \"very loosely approximates\" the neural networks and talents of the brain.\n\nGoogle data center 60 Minutes\n\nDemis Hassabis: Things like memory, imagination, planning, reinforcement learning, these are all things that are known about how the brain does it, and we wanted to replicate some of that in our AI systems.\n\nThose are some of the elements that led to DeepMind's greatest achievement so far -- solving an 'impossible' problem in biology.\n\nMost AI systems today do one or maybe two things well. The soccer robots, for example, can't write up a grocery list or book your travel or drive your car. The ultimate goal is what's called artificial general intelligence-- a learning machine that can score on a wide range of talents.\n\nScott Pelley: Would such a machine be conscious of itself?\n\nDemis Hassabis: So that's another great question. We-- you know, philosophers haven't really settled on a definition of consciousness yet, but if we mean by sort of self-awareness and-- these kinds of things-- you know, I think there's a possibility AI one day could be. I definitely don't think they are today. But I think, again, this is one of the fascinating scientific things we're gonna find out on this journey towards AI.\n\nEven unconscious, current AI is superhuman in narrow ways.\n\nBack in California, we saw Google engineers teaching skills that robots will practice continuously on their own.\n\nRobot: Push the blue cube to the blue triangle.\n\nThey comprehend instructions\u2026\n\nAnd learn to recognize objects.\n\nRobot 106: What would you like?\n\nScott Pelley: How 'bout an apple?\n\nRyan: How about an apple.\n\nRobot 106: On my way, I will bring an apple to you.\n\nVincent Vanhoucke, senior director of Robotics, showed us how Robot 106 was trained on millions of images...\n\nRobot 106: I am going to pick up the apple.\n\n...and can recognize all the items on a crowded countertop.\n\nVincent Vanhoucke: If we can give the robot a diversity of experiences, a lot more different objects in different settings, the robot gets better at every one of them.\n\nNow that humans have pulled the forbidden fruit of artificial knowledge...\n\nScott Pelley: Thank you.\n\n...we start the genesis of a new humanity...\n\nScott Pelley: AI can utilize all the information in the world. What no human could ever hold in their head. And I wonder if humanity is diminished by this enormous capability that we're developing.\n\nJames Manyika: I think the possibilities of AI do not diminish humanity in any way. And in fact, in some ways, I think they actually raise us to even deeper, more profound questions.\n\nGoogle's James Manyika sees this moment as an inflection point.\n\nJames Manyika: I think we're constantly adding these, in, superpowers or capabilities to what humans can do in a way that expands possibilities, as opposed to narrow them, I think. So I don't think of it as diminishing humans, but it does raise some really profound questions for us. Who are we? What do we value? What are we good at? How do we relate with each other? Those become very, very important questions that are constantly gonna be, in one case-- sense exciting, but perhaps unsettling too.\n\nIt is an unsettling moment. Critics argue the rush to AI comes too fast -- while competitive pressure-- among giants like Google and start-ups you've never heard of, is propelling humanity into the future ready or not.\n\nSundar Pichai: But I think if take a 10-year outlook, it is so clear to me, we will have some form of very capable intelligence that can do amazing things. And we need to adapt as a society for it.\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai told us society must quickly adapt with regulations for AI in the economy, laws to punish abuse, and treaties among nations to make AI safe for the world.\n\nSundar Pichai: You know, these are deep questions. And, you know, we call this 'alignment.' You know, one way we think about: How do you develop AI systems that are aligned to human values-- and including-- morality? This is why I think the development of this needs to include not just engineers, but social scientists, ethicists, philosophers, and so on. And I think we have to be very thoughtful. And I think these are all things society needs to figure out as we move along. It's not for a company to decide.\n\nWe'll end with a note that had never appeared on 60 Minutes but one, in the AI revolution, you may be hearing often.

The Music Industry Is At An Inflection Point", "description": "The music industry is at a tipping point. There is still time for the creators and businesses within it to help shape what comes next, but that window of opportunity is both small, and closing. \u2013 Music Industry Blog", "url": "https://musicindustryblog.wordpress.com/2023/06/29/the-music-industrys-tipping-point-is-right-here-right-now/", "text": "Streaming is buckling under its own weight. The economics and structure that served it well in its first decade are not the ones that will get it through the next ten years. You might say that streaming is going through its \u2018start up to scale up\u2019 phase. AI is the disruption lightning rod of the moment, but transformational as it may prove to be, it is simply catalysing pre-existing disruptions. \u2018Fixing\u2019 the problems thrown up by AI would be dealing with symptoms rather than causes. The music industry is at a tipping point. There is still time for the creators and businesses within it to help shape what comes next, but that window of opportunity is both small, and closing.\n\nIs anyone earning what they want from streaming?\n\nWhen streaming first emerged, artists were worried it would not pay them enough; then the debate moved on to whether too much value lay with the biggest artists and labels; now with the superstar artist production line stuttering, the majors want a new royalty system to protect their income. Meanwhile, Spotify still struggles to generate a consistent profit. So the long tail, the majors, creators, and streaming services all think that streaming isn\u2019t paying them enough. Which begs the question: just who or what is streaming paying enough? Whatever the answer may be, the clear takeaway is that a royalty and remuneration system designed when albums, charts, downloads, and radio still ruled the roost, is failing to adapt to today\u2019s much changed music world.\n\nRemuneration pains are a symptom of consumption\n\nA host of potential innovations are vying to be the solution to streaming\u2019s remuneration woes (fan powered / user centric, two-tier licensing, etc.) but royalty challenges are the output, not the input. Streaming has shifted the majority of music behaviour from active listening to lean-back consumption, using algorithms to push consumers towards niches. The result is a consumption landscape shaped by fragmentation and passivity. There is a lot more consumption than before, with more consumers monetised, but the previous, finite artist economy has been replaced by an in-effect infinite song economy. Consumption needs \u2018fixing\u2019 before remuneration.\n\nWhile there are encouraging shifts towards monetising fandom, those tools will never have full effect if audiences are simply spending their time listening passively. There will, quite simply, be no fandom to monetise.\n\nMachines on all sides\n\nThese are the two key sets of market dynamics that AI, and some other emerging technologies, will make worse, not better. Lean-back consumption is where AI will have the biggest, near-term impact. Context based playlists deliver music that is good enough. It is all about the overall soundscape rather than individual tracks, and even less about the artists. Production music libraries, like Epidemic Sound, have already shown that their music is plenty good enough for such playlists. Generative AI is waiting to pick up the baton, and may be able to do it even better if the music is specifically designed for the hyper-specific music that algorithms have taught consumers to expect. What is more, generative AI can get even more specific by evolving to the listener\u2019s use case (i.e., like Endel). And if DSPs were to generate AI music themselves, then they could a) improve margins; b) stuff playlists; c) push users to the music. They who control the algorithm, control the listener.\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t bad enough for traditional labels and artists, a rising wave of virtual artists is hitting the market, such as K-pop acts Mave, Plave and Eternity, building on the foundations laid by the (now almost heritage) trailblazers like K/DA and Aespa. And even if these virtual artists have humans behind them, they are still a machine-centred challenge to wholly human artists (slightly crazy we even have to think in those terms these days!)\n\nSo, machines are opening a two-pronged attack on traditional labels and artists: 1) AI is competing for lean back, while 2) virtual artists compete for lean in (fandom).\n\nChoose your poison\n\nThe industry\u2019s strategy is to compel DSPs to take down problematic AI music and to keep the long tail in check with lower royalty rates. But that is unlikely to be enough. For example, why wouldn\u2019t superstar virtual artists be eligible for the same royalty rate as superstar human artists? Regardless of whether the superstars are virtual or human, arguments that superstars deserve higher rates for pulling people to DSPs in the first place becomes less convincing every day, as consumption becomes ever more fragmented and ever less reliant on superstars.\n\nBut the scale of this problem is about to erupt like a volcano. Because the existential threat will come from AI in the hands of humans. AI will accelerate the consumerisation of creation trend that has been harnessed by artists and fans alike on TikTok, Snapchat, BandLab and a host of other places. Throw simpler-than-simple generative AI into social platforms and suddenly you have the potential for consumers creating \u2018music\u2019 at the same rate they create photos and videos.\n\nMillions of new \u2018songs\u2019 every day would break streaming royalties. So, labels would just get DSPs to keep those tracks off streaming, right? Not necessarily. These would be tracks made by people, so they would bring with them ready-made audiences of friends, family, colleagues and connections. Everyone becomes a fan of everyone else. It is the zenith of the network effect. And AI creations do not need to have millions of streams to disrupt streaming economics; millions of them only need to have at least one stream each.\n\nAnd if friends can\u2019t listen on DSPs, then they\u2019ll listen on the social apps. Which means less time spent on streaming and further cultural dilution for DSPs. As one investment analyst put it to me: labels are faced with a \u2018choose your poison\u2019 choice, i.e., lower royalties now (due to dilution) or lower royalties later (due to smaller user bases).\n\nBuild a better train?\n\nThe entirely understandable temptation is to make what we have, work better. But sustaining innovation is unlikely to be enough. Just in the same way that it wasn\u2019t enough for train companies to build better trains when Henry Ford\u2019s new-fangled Model T car came to market.\n\nTo be clear, building a better train is a not a bad option. Today, nearly a century on from when the last Model T rolled off the production line, trains still play a pivotal role. But for music, everything points to making streaming work better AND building something new.\n\nStreaming fixed the problems of piracy and tumbling music sales. In doing so, it had the unintended consequence of commodifying music consumption. Without a new fork in the road, generative AI will simply hasten the utter domination of convenience. Pop will eat itself. AI will bring huge amount of value right across the music business, but portions of it will also hasten a reductive race to the bottom for convenient consumption.\n\nWhich is why, the time is now to start building plan B. To elevate a music world centred around fandom, identity, creativity, and exceptionalism. These are the fundamentally human elements of music that can (at least for now) clearly demarcate what is inevitably going to become a two-track music world.\n\nFive years ago, it would have been crazy to be thinking about how machines will shape the near future of both the business of music and of music itself. Just imagine what we might be discussing five years in the future?\u2026..", "tiktoken_token_count": 1525, "llama_token_count": 1774}, {"source_name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "author": "Anusuya Lahiri", "title": "DeepMind Co-Founder's Startup 'Inflection AI' Secures $1.3B in Funding from Microsoft and Nvidia", "description": "Inflection AI has raised $1.3 billion from Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), among others.

(0:55)\n\nThe NFL offseason is always long and eventful. With training camps kicking off, we decided to catch you up on everything you need to know, from the obvious storylines to the under-the-radar happenings you may have missed. That includes big-name free agency signings, franchise-altering draft picks, key coaching moves, important news around the league and rule changes for 2023.\n\nPreseason contests begin on Aug. 3 with the Hall of Fame Game (New York Jets at Cleveland Browns, 8 p.m. ET on NBC) and conclude on Aug. 27. Rosters will be cut down to 53 players on Aug. 29, and preseason training camp ends Sept. 3. The regular season will be right around the corner at that point, with the Detroit Lions visiting the Kansas City Chiefs on Sept. 7 (8:20 p.m. ET on NBC) in the opener.\n\nBefore the games get rolling, NFL Nation reporters Stephen Holder and Brooke Pryor will get you up to speed on the past five months. Let's start with a few things you all (should) already know.\n\nJump to:\n\nHeadlines | Key signings | Draft stars\n\nCoach moves | Off-field news | Rule changes\n\nBest of the rest\n\nWait, Brady retired (again)? And Rodgers is in New York?\n\nHolder: Quarterback movement has dominated offseason news cycles in recent years, so why would 2023 have been any different? Alas, it was not.\n\nTom Brady retired for the second consecutive offseason, and this time was for real (we think). He famously retired and subsequently unretired in early 2022, returning for a remarkable 23rd season. This time, he bid farewell in a simple video posted to his social channels on Feb. 1, in which he said he is retiring \"for good.\" Brady's third and final season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (after the first 20 with the New England Patriots) concluded with a wild-card loss to the Dallas Cowboys, capping a seven-title career.\n\nElsewhere, another quarterback era ended with Aaron Rodgers moving from the Green Bay Packers to the Jets after what seemed like the longest trade negotiation in NFL history. After months of speculation, the Jets landed their QB when the teams agreed to terms just days before the NFL draft. Acquiring the four-time MVP has put New York in the mix of a juicy conversation in the AFC East, where the Jets, Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins all have reason to believe they can win the division and chase a Super Bowl.\n\nWhich players have a new team?\n\nPryor: Free agency saw many talented players land in new spots. Offensive tackle Orlando Brown Jr. was our No. 1 free agent this year, and he ended up signing a four-year, $64 million deal with the Cincinnati Bengals. With a Super Bowl ring already on his finger from his time with the Chiefs, the onetime Baltimore Raven rejoined the AFC North, earning $43.5 million guaranteed to protect Joe Burrow's blindside. Brown's $31 million signing bonus was the highest ever for an offensive lineman.\n\nBrown, who asked to be traded from the Ravens in 2021 to play left tackle, spent the 2022 campaign on the franchise tag. After the season, the Chiefs promptly signed former Jacksonville Jaguars tackle Jawaan Taylor to a four-year, $80 million deal -- with $60 million guaranteed -- to take his spot. Here are some other notable signings from the free agency period:\n\nNot every player on the move chose his destination this offseason, and several big names (besides Rodgers, of course) are on new teams via trade. Some of the most notable include tight end Darren Waller going from the Raiders to the New York Giants, defensive end Za'Darius Smith heading from the Minnesota Vikings to Cleveland, wide receiver DJ Moore shifting from Carolina to the Chicago Bears, cornerback Jalen Ramsey joining the Dolphins from the Los Angeles Rams, wideout Brandin Cooks coming from the Houston Texans to the Cowboys, wide receiver Allen Robinson II going from the Rams to the Pittsburgh Steelers, corner Stephon Gilmore joining the Cowboys from the Indianapolis Colts and running back D'Andre Swift making the move from the Lions to the Eagles.\n\nWhich rookies are set to take over the NFL?\n\nHolder: One year after a single quarterback was selected in the first round of the 2022 draft (Kenny Pickett), quarterbacks dominated the early picks in the 2023 draft, and they could come to define the future of their respective franchises. Three of the top four selections were signal-callers. First up among the future heroes or heartbreakers is Carolina's Bryce Young, a standout talent whom the Panthers hope can help reset their franchise. The Panthers traded up to No. 1 in a deal with the Bears to have the chance to add Young. Whether his playmaking translates to the NFL game despite his 5-foot-10, 194-pound size will be among the more fascinating subplots of this season.\n\nplay 1:31 Can Bryce Young lead the Panthers to a playoff run? Alan Hahn and Sam Acho break down the likelihood of Bryce Young leading the Panthers to a deep run in the NFL playoffs.\n\nThen C.J. Stroud went second overall to the Texans. Whether he knows it or not, Stroud is the key to getting Houston past the ugly ending of the Deshaun Watson era and the year-plus of constant controversy that enveloped the entire organization. That's a heavy load for someone who hasn't yet turned 22 years old. No pressure, kid. Houston followed the Stroud selection with an aggressive trade to acquire the No. 3 overall pick, where it grabbed edge rusher Will Anderson Jr.\n\nAnthony Richardson capped off the first-round quarterbacks in going to the Colts at No. 4, and his development will be closely scrutinized given his lack of experience. As a one-year starter at the Florida, Richardson arrived in Indy a month shy of his 21st birthday. But he'll need to grow up fast. The Colts have been in the quarterback wilderness since 2019, when Andrew Luck walked away unexpectedly. One thing is certain: Richardson has some impressive physical traits.\n\nIn other draft-related news, the Atlanta Falcons made running back Bijan Robinson (No. 8 overall) the highest-drafted player at his position since Saquon Barkley was chosen second overall in 2018. And the Eagles bolstered their defense with two of Georgia's top prospects, Jalen Carter and Nolan Smith -- much to the chagrin of the rest of the NFC East.\n\nAny coaching moves to know about?\n\nPryor: Hop aboard the coaching carousel and hold on tight, because it got wild this offseason. First up, Sean Payton is back, baby, and I don't think we're talking enough about the Denver Broncos' Payton/George Paton coach/general manager combo purely from a pun possibility perspective: Payton gives Paton his \"why,\" etc. OK fine, I'll admit that was pretty weak.\n\nWhat isn't weak, though, is the Texans hiring DeMeco Ryans from the 49ers to take over in Houston. Coupled with two top-five picks, the Texans are on the cusp of a new era. It's also a new day in Charlotte, where the Panthers ended Matt Rhule's, well, rule, and brought in Frank Reich and his coaching staff after an interim stint by Steve Wilks (now the 49ers defensive coordinator, replacing Ryans). That's one full lap around the carousel.\n\nTaking Reich's place in Indianapolis -- after a brief, head-scratching interim tenure by Jeff Saturday -- is former Eagles offensive coordinator Shane Steichen. Meanwhile, Steichen's defensive counterpart in Philadelphia, Jonathan Gannon, replaced Kliff Kingsbury as Arizona Cardinals head coach.\n\nHow about coordinator moves? Eric Bieniemy went from the Chiefs to the Washington Commanders to prove he can run an offense without Andy Reid, and Bill O'Brien returned to the Patriots to replace Matt Patricia and Joe Judge as Bill Belichick's offensive playcaller. Leslie Frazier decided to take a year away from coaching, leaving Bills coach Sean McDermott to assume defensive coordinator duties. Nathaniel Hackett got another shot with Aaron Rodgers in New York, Kellen Moore went from Dallas to Hollywood to help Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert and Brian Flores left the Steelers to become the Vikings defensive coordinator.\n\nWhat are the most important off-field happenings from the offseason?\n\nHolder: The long, sordid Dan Snyder era is over in Washington. The sale of the Commanders for $6.05 billion to an ownership group led by Josh Harris was unanimously approved by NFL owners last week. The transaction moves the NFL closer to the conclusion of a chapter it would like to forget.\n\nSnyder also was fined $60 million after a league-commissioned independent investigation concluded he sexually harassed a team employee and the team withheld revenue from the NFL. Still unresolved are numerous lawsuits by former team employees stemming from conduct in what has been described as a hostile workplace.\n\nplay 0:26 NFL owners approve sale of Commanders Adam Schefter reports on the NFL owners' vote to approve the sale of the Washington Commanders to a group led by Josh Harris for $6.05 billion.\n\nElsewhere:\n\nWhat rule changes do I need to know?\n\nPryor: We're not redefining a catch this year, but there are a couple of rule changes to keep in mind in 2023. For one thing, tripping is now considered a personal foul and will result in a 15-yard penalty -- and can be subject to additional penalties (including fines) whether or not it is called in a game.\n\nAlso in on-field rule changes, all failed fourth-down conversions will be subject to an automatic booth review, and head coaches can't challenge a failed fourth-down conversion. But a successful fourth-down conversion can be challenged by coaches, unless it occurs inside the two-minute warning or during overtime.\n\nIt's never too early to start your fantasy football season The offseason is heating up and it's the perfect time to kick off your fantasy season. Create a league and customize league size, scoring and rules to play in the league you want to play in. Create a league today!\n\nWhen an instant replay decision leads to a reversal of the call under two minutes, the play clock will be reset to 40 seconds instead of 25, unless another rule supersedes it -- like a 10-second runoff, in which case the play clock will be reset to 30 seconds.\n\nThe use of helmet rule also was modified in 2023 to prevent a player from using any part of his helmet or face mask to make forcible contact to an opponent's head or neck area.\n\nOther rule changes around the game include fair catches on kickoffs being placed at the 25-yard line; players being permitted to wear No. 0 jerseys; one day for rosters to be cut from 90 to 53 (Aug. 29); the addition of a third active quarterback on game day; and the introduction of \"Thursday Night Football\" flex scheduling. (The flex can happen from Weeks 13 to 17 and can only be used twice. Teams must have a 28-day notice of the schedule change.)\n\nLightning round: What else happened this summer?\n\nHolder: There's some new money in the NFL this season. Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, as expected, signed a massive deal on the heels of his team's Super Bowl berth: five years and $255 million, with $179.4 million in total guarantees. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones also was secured long term, signing a four-year, $160 million deal.\n\nElsewhere, this was the year of the defensive lineman when it came to extensions. Quinnen Williams (Jets, four years, $96 million), Jeffery Simmons (Tennessee Titans, four years, $94 million), Dexter Lawrence (Giants, four years, $90 million) and Daron Payne (Commanders, four years, $90 million) all got long-awaited new contracts.\n\nPryor: Wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins found a new home with the Titans just before training camp. But other prominent players are still free agents: Ezekiel Elliott, Kareem Hunt, Leonard Fournette and Dalvin Cook. Hmm, it seems like all of those guys have something in common.\n\nHolder: This will be the first season since 2011 without one of the greatest pass-rushers in NFL history chasing quarterbacks. J.J. Watt walked away after 12 seasons, 114.5 sacks and 195 tackles for loss (second in NFL history).\n\nPryor: Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs missed a day of mandatory minicamp amid frustrations with his role in the offense. Buffalo coach Sean McDermott excused the absence and said the matter was \"resolved\" on the second day of the June minicamp; but a day earlier, McDermott said he was \"very concerned\" about Diggs' absence. Meanwhile, Cowboys guard Zack Martin's status for training camp is up in the air because he is unhappy with his contract and the team's lack of interest in restructuring it, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Martin, a six-time first-team All-Pro, is currently scheduled to make $7 million less than the NFL's top paid guards. Also, defensive tackle Chris Jones did not report for the start of the Chiefs' camp. Jones is seeking a new deal, and the two sides are \"far apart,\" per Schefter.\n\nOther players unhappy with their situations requested trades, including Cardinals safety Budda Baker and Bucs linebacker Devin White. Bengals offensive tackle Jonah Williams initially requested a trade after the team signed Orlando Brown Jr. in free agency, kicking Williams to right tackle. Williams, though, backed off the demand in mid-June.\n\nHolder: Brock Purdy has the inside track to start at quarterback for the 49ers, according to coach Kyle Shanahan, but will Purdy's elbow injury open the door for Trey Lance? The Niners have one of the more fascinating quarterback situations in the NFL. Another one to watch? Jordan Love takes the reins at QB in Green Bay, emerging from Aaron Rodgers' shadow. The 2020 first-round pick has started just one game in his career and has attempted 83 passes over three seasons.\n\nplay 1:03 Schefter details Jordan Love's offseason progress with the Packers Adam Schefter explains the expectations for Jordan Love and why his Packers teammates have \"extreme confidence\" in their QB.\n\nPryor: After a discrete process, the NFL Players Association announced the election of executive director Lloyd Howell, a former Booz Allen consulting firm executive who will replace DeMaurice Smith. Smith held the role for five terms that spanned over 14 years, during which time he navigated two collective bargaining agreements, a lockout and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHolder: A contract extension for NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is in the works and expected to be finalized soon. It will, perhaps, be the final deal for the longtime commissioner, as discussions about his successor are underway among owners. Goodell, whose contract expires next year, has overseen the most prosperous period in NFL history.\n\nPryor: The NFLPA is investigating agent David Canter for allegations of bribery during NFL draft weekend, sources told ESPN. He allegedly sent text messages to several NFL general managers offering use of his vacation homes, including links to the properties, in exchange for the teams drafting his players.\n\nHolder: The racial discrimination lawsuit filed by former Dolphins coach Brian Flores will move forward in federal court after a judge ruled his claims would not be limited to arbitration. It increases the likelihood that testimony and evidence unflattering to the NFL will become public.\n\nPryor: In legal news, a misdemeanor assault charge against Raiders wideout Davante Adams stemming from an incident in which he shoved a credentialed media worker after a game was dropped. Saints running back Alvin Kamara agreed to plead no contest to a misdemeanor charge of breach of peace for his involvement in a 2022 fight in Las Vegas.

I know in Edmonton, we were one of the first teams to use the Pride tape,\" the star boasted.\n\n\u201cWe strongly feel hockey is for everybody, and that includes the Pride nights,\" the team captain reiterated.\n\nSteven Stamkos, two-time Stanley Cup champion and star in the league since 2008, said that he thinks \"guys should have the right to do what they want.\"\n\n\u201cIt was 98 per cent or 99 per cent of other players that wore the jersey and enjoyed wearing it and were proud wearing it \u2014 whatever jersey it was \u2014 whether it was the Pride, the military night, the cancer nights,\" the Tampa Bay Lightning forward continued.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe story shouldn\u2019t be about the guy that didn\u2019t wear it \u2014 the one guy or the two guys.\u201d\n\nAt least seven players opted out of wearing the jerseys in the 2022-2023 season, including Canadians James Reimer, Eric Staal, and Marc Staal, along with Russians Andrei Kuzmenko, Ilya Lyubushkin, Ivan Provorov, and Ilya Samsonov.\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks, New York Rangers, and Minnesota Wild were the only organizations not to participate in the ritual that season.\n\n\u201cI understand that\u2019s what gets the clicks and that\u2019s what gets the views, but the word \u2018distraction\u2019 gets thrown around. I don\u2019t think it had to have been a distraction,\u201d Stamkos went on. \u201cIt could have been a non-issue while focusing on the good that was coming out of those nights and the money that was raised and the players that did wear the jerseys those nights.\u201d\n\n\n\nSwedish-born Calgary Flames forward Mikael Backlund said attention was taken away from the \u201cright reasons,\" according to TimCast.\n\n\u201cAll of us were wearing the jerseys \u2026 everyone was looking [at], \u2018Who\u2019s not and why not?'\u201d he said. \u201cI understand the decision the NHL made to take that distraction away.

The Braves are still slugging a ton of home runs, so it's not really a cause for concern, and they're averaging 5.57 runs per game overall (through Tuesday), which would be their highest since 2003, when they averaged 5.60 per game (not counting 2020, when they averaged 5.80). The Braves made some minor moves to add pitching depth, claiming Yonny Chirinos off waivers from the Rays and acquiring relievers Pierce Johnson (Rockies) and Taylor Hearn (Rangers). Johnson is the one most likely to make an impact. He had 13 saves with the Rockies, although with a 6.00 ERA. -- Schoenfield\n\nRecord: 62-40\n\nPrevious ranking: 4\n\nThe Orioles' bullpen has been a strength for two years running and in Felix Bautista and Yennier Cano, they've had one of the most devastating one-two high-leverage combos in the majors this season. But with the Orioles angling for a division title and possible No. 1 seed in the American League bracket, they need to add depth to this area of strength. Part of it is because Cano has been on the back-pedal a bit in recent weeks, a slump that perhaps reached its nadir with a blown save loss to the Phillies on Tuesday.\n\nOn the other hand, recent pickup Shintaro Fujinami threw two perfect innings with three whiffs in that game. After a brutal start to the season, Fujinami's numbers have been on the upswing and the Orioles just might be able to catch some lightning in a bottle with him. But they'll need more of that with the deadline approaching, in addition to a need for rotation upgrades that has garnered much contention. -- Doolittle\n\nRecord: 58-43\n\nPrevious ranking: 5\n\nA lot could change about the Dodgers over these next five days, but before it does, let's take some time to appreciate the state of their current iteration, which is in first place, once again, despite a litany of issues throughout their roster. Their rotation has been a mess, with Clayton Kershaw and Dustin May hurt, Noah Syndergaard struggling mightily -- and then being shipped to Cleveland for shortstop Amed Rosario -- and Julio Urias having an up-and-down year. They haven't been strong up the middle, particularly at second base, shortstop and center field. Until recently, the back end of their bullpen had been a problem, too. And yet the Dodgers continue to dominate, at a time when so many high-profile teams are struggling. It's truly remarkable. -- Gonzalez\n\nRecord: 62-43\n\nPrevious ranking: 2\n\nThe month of July has transmogrified our perceptions about this year's Rays. At the end of June, the Rays were rolling, with a win pace of 109, a runs scored pace of 913 and net-run pace of 311. Those numbers have since dropped to 97, 847 and 229. While much of the trade deadline chatter about the Rays centers on their need for rotation depth, Tampa Bay needs to regain its offensive prowess to get its championship train rolling again. During July, the Rays' offense ranks 29th in both OPS and runs per game and is dead last in on-base percentage. Among the key strugglers: Wander Franco (.511) and Randy Arozarena (.499) have seen their OPSs plummet this month. -- Doolittle\n\nRecord: 60-41\n\nPrevious ranking: 3\n\nTexas should be as busy as anyone at the trade deadline, with bullpen help, a starter and perhaps another bat in its sights. It was a rough week for all Rangers pitchers, as they gave up 41 runs in a four-game span. It led to the highest ERA in baseball over a seven-day period ending Tuesday: 8.21. The Rangers had just one starter last six innings, taxing a bullpen that simply kept giving up hit after hit after hit to the Dodgers in a series loss. With Nathan Eovaldi getting a break this week, there's a further emphasis on the need for pitching before Tuesday's trade deadline. -- Rogers\n\nRecord: 56-45\n\nPrevious ranking: 6\n\nMost metrics-based projection models likely still favor the Rangers in the AL West race because of their overwhelming edge over the Astros in run differential. But let's face it: With Houston closing in on the division leaders, the West once again seems like the Astros' race to lose. That means first-year GM Dana Brown can make targeted additions at the deadline, as the Astros very much remain who we thought they were. Brown told reporters that the club will likely target rotation depth, bullpen help and a left-handed bat. On the latter front, Houston ranks last -- by far -- in plate appearances from lefty batters this season. They also rank first in OPS from that group and by a good margin, so perhaps Brown should be careful to not impact the quality of his lefty at-bats in pursuit of quantity. -- Doolittle\n\nRecord: 57-46\n\nPrevious ranking: 7\n\nAs with pretty much every other contender, much of the Blue Jays' deadline-related chatter has revolved around the possibility of adding to the rotation. One quick survey of the trade terrain and the long list of teams with remaining playoff aspirations tells you that there will be some disappointed general managers a week from now. But, of course, trading for a starting pitcher isn't the only way to improve a club on the fly.\n\nIn the Blue Jays' case, one area that might have an outsized impact down the stretch would be the acquisition of a good old fashioned take-and-rake slugger. While the Jays rank near the top of MLB in categories like batting average, OBP and lowest strikeout rate, they are in the middle of the pack in runs, which, let's face it, is the category that matters most. While the question of where a three-true-outcomes slugger would play is a fair one, someone with the profile of Pirates veteran Carlos Santana (who just might be available) would be a nice complementary fit. -- Doolittle\n\nRecord: 53-46\n\nPrevious ranking: 9\n\nThe early returns on Bryce Harper's move to first base have been positive with Harper saying, \"I feel very comfortable there.\" That continues to lead to speculation that the Phillies will look to add a corner bat at the trade deadline, allowing them to move Kyle Schwarber to DH on a regular basis. It certainly makes sense, as Schwarber's defensive metrics put his outfielder jump rating and outs above average rating both at a bottom-of-the-barrel first percentile in the majors. Jake Cave is hitting .231/.291/.333, so he's not really the solution to take over in left field. Maybe somebody like the Rockies' Randal Grichuk fits the bill or, knowing president of baseball ops Dave Dombrowski's penchant for thinking big, perhaps one of the outfielders from the Cardinals -- or Cody Bellinger, if the Cubs decide to trade him. -- Schoenfield\n\nRecord: 57-46\n\nPrevious ranking: 12\n\nThe overwhelming favorite to win the division, Milwaukee is likely to be active at the trade deadline. Annually, the Brewers need help at the plate, and this July is no different. They rank in the bottom third of the majors in OPS in three of the four infield positions. The latest injury to Rowdy Tellez -- he injured his finger shagging fly balls -- should make GM Matt Arnold's job easier: There's no doubting what the team needs. The Brewers could also probably use help on the mound if they're thinking of winning in October, not just getting there. -- Rogers\n\nRecord: 55-47\n\nPrevious ranking: 11\n\nMLB trade deadline tracker Here's what we're hearing as the Aug. 1 trade deadline approaches. Rumors, Analysis, Latest News \u00bb\n\nWith the trade deadline almost here, the Red Sox have a chance to make as big of an in-season upgrade as any other contender -- and it's not because of a splashy acquisition. Indeed, they started off the deadline period by trading away their most oft-used shortstop this season, Enrique Hernandez, to the Dodgers. While the struggling Hernandez had not been used there much recently, the timing of the deal coincided with some happy news for the BoSox: the impending return of Trevor Story.\n\nStory, who has missed the entire season because of an elbow injury, has been playing in rehab outings in the minors and after the Hernandez trade was announced, manager Alex Cora said Story could return to the majors as soon as the coming weekend. Early on it was far from certain that he'd return in 2023 at all, so getting the two-time All-Star back before the start of August is a best-case scenario.\n\nThe lack of year-to-date production from Boston's shortstops represents one of the bigger holes on any postseason contender. If Story can return at anything close to his normal production, that's a huge upgrade at a crucial position, arguably better than anything the Red Sox might have gotten from the trade market. -- Doolittle\n\nRecord: 54-48\n\nPrevious ranking: 14\n\nDepending on where you look, the Yankees' chances to reach the postseason have sunk to somewhere between about 1-in-5 to 2-in-5. When you look at payroll and the career profiles of this roster, you can't help but feel that something here just isn't right. And whatever it is, it goes well beyond the soon-to-end absence of Aaron Judge. During Judge's absence (since June 3), the Yankees have ranked near the bottom of the majors in OPS and runs.\n\nThe one player who has been solid at the plate all season, including during the current downturn, has been Gleyber Torres. Torres has been picking up momentum of late, with a .318/.355/.506 slash line in July. That leads us to the upcoming deadline. Torres has occasionally come up in the trade rumor mill. On one hand, it makes sense, as the Yankees have a number of young infielders at or near the majors. On the other hand, none of those players, other than Torres, have hit this season. So if you trade Torres, where does that leave this moribund attack? -- Doolittle\n\nRecord: 54-50\n\nPrevious ranking: 16\n\nWhen the Twins beat the Mariners 4-3 on Monday, their team temperature (a Bill James-derived measure for which 72 degrees is average) rose to 103 degrees. That marked the first time all season that the Twins' temp reached triple digits and proved this enigmatic club is actually capable of getting hot. The 14-8 spree that began June 30 improved the chances that the eventual AL Central champion will finish with a better record than at least one team from the AL East. It might also have clarified matters for the deadline approach of a Minnesota team that will have to confront underdog status no matter who they play if and when they reach the playoffs. While every team could use more pitching, the Twins' staff is good enough that they can put their trade resources toward much-needed offensive help. -- Doolittle\n\nRecord: 54-47\n\nPrevious ranking: 8\n\nThe Giants have aggressively promoted the likes of Patrick Bailey, Casey Schmitt and Luis Matos this season -- and now they're doing the same with Marco Luciano. Luciano, the team's top hitting prospect, was called up Wednesday morning after just a six-game Triple-A stint and will take over as the everyday shortstop, at least for the foreseeable future. Leading up to that point, the Giants had scored only 11 runs in their previous seven games (six of them losses) and were in need of a spark, particularly from their middle infield. Luciano, 21, missed the first month of the season because of a back injury but had been slashing .262/.370/.490 in the minor leagues since the start of June. Brandon Crawford is nearing his way back from the injured list, but the Giants will probably find room for Luciano if he's hitting. -- Gonzalez\n\nRecord: 55-48\n\nPrevious ranking: 10\n\nThe month of July has been especially unkind to the D-backs. They've dropped 14 of 20 games, going from a three-game cushion to a four-game deficit in the NL West while getting swept by the Mets, Blue Jays and Reds. Their dynamic offense is slashing only .239/.317/.410 this month, but their rotation has pitched to a 5.20 ERA and their bullpen has put up a 1.60 WHIP. So, it has all been bad. And their next five series -- against the Mariners, Giants, Twins, Dodgers and Padres, respectively -- won't make things any easier. The D-backs could desperately use a boost, particularly with a pitching acquisition or two. Merrill Kelly is back, at least, and he provided six innings of one-run ball against the Cardinals on Tuesday. -- Gonzalez\n\nRecord: 56-48\n\nPrevious ranking: 15\n\nCincinnati is scouring the pitching market. A veteran arm could solidify a staff that should be stronger down the stretch as its own pitchers get healthy. The Reds are in a tight division battle with the Brewers, who have the pitching but not the hitting. Cincinnati is the opposite. While Elly De La Cruz had a rare tough week, going 3-for-19 over a six-game span, Will Benson and Matt McClain picked him up -- both OPS'd over 1.000 in the same time frame. Cincinnati is in that fun \"different hero every night\" stage of its rebuild. If it gets a starter with experience at the deadline, an earlier-than-expected appearance in the postseason is still possible. -- Rogers\n\nRecord: 55-48\n\nPrevious ranking: 13\n\nTuesday's 4-1 loss to the Rays dropped the Marlins to 3-11 in their past 14 games -- before Miami's win over Tampa Bay on Wednesday -- as both the offense and pitching have scuffled since returning from the All-Star break (they lost eight in a row coming out of the break to the Orioles, Cardinals and Rockies). The Marlins hit .244 with just four home runs over a 10-game stretch and even Luis Arraez hit a mere .310 over that period, although he did deliver the walk-off base hit to beat the Rockies on Sunday. Johnny Cueto made his first start since April 3 on Saturday and allowed just one run in six innings with eight strikeouts, so that's a good sign as Eury Perez remains in the minors to help conserve his innings (he hasn't pitched since being sent down). -- Schoenfield\n\nRecord: 52-49\n\nPrevious ranking: 19\n\nThe Angels have been doing their part on the field to try to ensure that Shohei Ohtani would not be traded before the deadline. A 13-game stretch that saw them lose 11 times has been followed with six wins in seven games, allowing them to remain within striking distance of the final wild-card spot with Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon out. The franchise appeared to go all-in on seeing how this plays out for the rest of the season on Wednesday night by first pulling Ohtani's name off the trade market and then making a deal to acquire Lucas Giolito and Reynaldo Lopez from the White Sox. -- Gonzalez\n\nRecord: 49-54\n\nPrevious ranking: 18\n\nBlake Snell started against the Pirates on Tuesday, pitching six innings of one-run ball to lower his ERA to 2.61 and continue his run as one of the sport's most dominant pitchers since the start of May. The question, of course, is whether that will ultimately be his last start in a Padres uniform. The Padres won that night's game, but by that point they had split their first dozen games since the All-Star break and thus remained below .500. They still believe they have the makings of a championship-contending team if moves are made on the margins of the roster, but they're running out of time. And others will undoubtedly present some intriguing trade packages for Snell and closer Josh Hader, both of whom will be free agents at season's end. It remains to be seen whether they'll be traded. -- Gonzalez\n\nRecord: 52-50\n\nPrevious ranking: 17\n\nWhat a wild two games against the Twins. On Monday, Kolten Wong hit a shocking two-run, two-out go-ahead home run in the top of the ninth -- only to see Andres Munoz blow the save and the Mariners lose in the 10th. On Tuesday, they were down four runs in the eighth before rallying for seven runs over the final two frames -- the first time since 1991 they rallied from that far down on the road in the eighth inning. Julio Rodriguez had his second career two-homer game in the win, including a tying blast in the eighth -- on the day he was dropped from second to fifth in the batting order. It was rare high-leverage production from Rodriguez, who was so good in the clutch last season but entered Tuesday's game hitting just .183 in high-leverage situations. -- Schoenfield\n\nRecord: 51-51\n\nPrevious ranking: 20\n\nESPN 'Sunday Night Baseball' Catch the biggest names and the best teams in baseball on ESPN all season long. Sunday, 7 p.m. ET: Yankees-Orioles\n\nThe Guardians are close enough to the Twins that they probably won't be looking to make any big deals (meaning trading players away, because we know they are unlikely to make any big deals to bring players in), although there certainly will be a lot of interest in some of their bullpen arms.\n\nIn the meantime, with Xzavion Curry now in the rotation, the Guardians have four rookie starters in him, Tanner Bibee, Logan Allen and Gavin Williams. Curry's first two starts have each been three innings, so we'll see if he remains more of an opener or whether they'll look to stretch him out. Williams, the first-round pick in 2021, is seen as having the highest ceiling. He has been solid, if unspectacular, so far -- he hasn't generated a ton of swing-and-misses (except one start against the Royals) and the command is a little shaky -- but he owns a nice four-pitch arsenal, with his four-seamer averaging 95 mph. -- Schoenfield\n\nRecord: 50-51\n\nPrevious ranking: 22\n\nWhile the Cubs were almost a sure team to deal a few weeks ago, they are clawing their way back to .500. The odds say it's still a long shot for Chicago to make the playoffs but with an easy schedule this week -- combined with tougher ones for rivals in Milwaukee and Cincinnati -- the momentum in the division might favor the Cubs as the trade deadline approaches. It's not so much what they'll add but what they won't give up: Bellinger. He has been on fire since returning from an injury in May. Since the All-Star break, alone, he has an OPS over 1.300. If the Cubs do add, it'll be in the bullpen, where they desperately need a veteran lefty and another right-hander. -- Rogers\n\nRecord: 47-54\n\nPrevious ranking: 21\n\nThe Mets remain one of the most intriguing teams to watch at the trade deadline, especially in regard to what they'll do with Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer. Both have no-trade clauses and big salaries for 2024, so trading them won't be easy.\n\nBut interest certainly has to be increasing on Verlander after he had another excellent outing Tuesday against the Yankees with six scoreless innings. He has a 1.98 ERA over his past eight starts while limiting batters to a .184 average. It's not a completely rosy picture -- he did walk four against the Yankees and had a six-walk game against the Dodgers on July 14, plus his strikeout rate isn't overly impressive in that span. But it's Verlander, and he's pitching well. Factor in that the Mets' next seven games are against the Nationals and Royals and they might just decide to let things play out. -- Schoenfield\n\nRecord: 46-57\n\nPrevious ranking: 23\n\nRetool, retool, retool. It's not a concept the Cardinals are used to, but they have no choice after a losing weekend in Chicago in which they won Game 1 of the series only to drop the next three. Jordan Montgomery and Jack Flaherty are likely moving on, but how far will St. Louis go? Most think not that far as the division is no juggernaut, and as long as the Cardinals find some pitching for next season, they could be right back near the top of the division. Montgomery's streak of giving up one or fewer runs came to an end at five games after he gave up five to the Cubs on Sunday. He still managed to get through six innings, though, so his stock should not have fallen much after one mediocre start. -- Rogers\n\nRecord: 46-55\n\nPrevious ranking: 24\n\nThe Tigers' postseason chances remain small, as does the likelihood of them making a splashy acquisition before the deadline. Still, the narrative of the Tigers' season has shifted in recent weeks for the better. For a while, it seemed like the building-block young players on the roster were all either injured or struggling, but the trend has reversed in recent games.\n\nRiley Greene has returned to the lineup and resumed his sharp upward trajectory. Spencer Torkelson isn't there yet in terms of consistency but his numbers have been on the climb. Most importantly, the Tigers have pitched their tails off of late with young hurlers Matt Manning, Tarik Skubal and Reese Olson all playing a part in that. Their continued progress from here to the end of the season would give Tigers fans ample reason to enter the offseason with a lot more optimism than you would have thought possible two months ago. -- Doolittle\n\nRecord: 45-57\n\nPrevious ranking: 25\n\nWho's the team to beat in the second half? Will the unexpected contenders continue to rule the home stretch? Everything you need to know coming out of the All-Star break. Second-half preview, rankings, playoff odds for all 30 MLB teams \u00bb\n\nIt has been a while since the Pirates won a series as they've methodically moved down the standings and into last place in the NL Central. They ranked 26th in ERA over the past month and 28th over the past two weeks as no regular starter has an ERA under 4.00. All-Star Mitch Keller's ERA in July is over 7.00, and that's with a seven-inning shutout included. Teams are simply squaring him up more, unlike earlier in the year when he was inducing soft contact. He'll set a career high in innings pitched as long as he's healthy. That's the good news. There isn't much of that these days in Pittsburgh. -- Rogers\n\nRecord: 41-62\n\nPrevious ranking: 26\n\nFalling to 20 games below .500 as we near the trade deadline is the exclamation mark on a horrendous season that should result in a front office shakeup. But this is the White Sox, so it's anyone's guess what owner Jerry Reinsdorf will do after the team's rebuild fell flat on its face. First up, the team moved pitchers Lucas Giolito and Reynaldo Lopez in a trade with the Angels. Next to go could be Lance Lynn and Joe Kelly. Statistically, there haven't been many worse position players than Tim Anderson, but he has gotten hot at the right time if the White Sox are thinking of trading him. He hit .378 in the first nine games after the All-Star break, driving the ball to right field like he usually does when things are going well for him. Little has this season, though. -- Rogers\n\nRecord: 43-59\n\nPrevious ranking: 27\n\nHere's a goal: Pass the Mets and finish in fourth place! Who was taking bets before the season that the Nationals would finish with a better record than the Mets? Washington heads to Citi Field for four games this weekend, so if it takes three of four or even sweeps New York that would put pressure on that \"race.\" One way to catch the Mets is for MacKenzie Gore to get on a roll -- or at least show some consistency. He has had a weird every-other-start-is-a-good-one thing going. Look at his runs allowed since June 10: 5, 0, 5, 1, 7, 0 (lifted early because of a rain delay), 5, 0. Overall, his whiff (74th percentile) and strikeout rates (79th percentile) are strong indicators, while his control continues to be his biggest problem. It's a learning curve, but there is still No. 2 starter potential here. -- Schoenfield\n\nRecord: 40-62\n\nPrevious ranking: 28\n\nThe Rockies' jarring pitching issues clearly extend beyond the major leagues. Three of their top four pitching prospects, as ranked by MLB.com, were scheduled to undergo Tommy John surgery this week, right around the same time as Antonio Senzatela. The three prospects: Gabriel Hughes, the 10th overall pick in 2022; Jackson Cox, a second-round selection in that same draft; and Jordy Vargas, an international signing in 2021. Hughes, Vargas and Cox were ranked sixth, 11th and 12th, respectively, in the Rockies' system by MLB.com. Now they might not pitch until 2025. The Rockies have already started selling off major league players, with veteran reliever Pierce Johnson dealt to the Braves on Monday. More will follow. -- Gonzalez\n\nRecord: 29-75\n\nPrevious ranking: 29\n\nThis is hard to believe, but it is the Royals we're talking about here: Cleveland beat Kansas City on Tuesday to hand Zack Greinke his 16th consecutive road loss.

To skip our detailed analysis of the technology industry and current developments within it, you can go directly to see the 5 Best Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nThe technology industry has seen a stellar 2023 so far, with most investors viewing this sector as the market's savior amidst inflation concerns. Part of the reason why tech has been doing so well is, of course, the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Most tech companies of significance today are making significant headway in the field of AI as the corporations of the world take part in a global AI arms race. No tech company wants to be left behind in the face of this rapidly transforming market as AI continues to revolutionize the tech industry like the Internet did in 1995. As such, some of the best large-cap tech companies today are going above and beyond to compete in the AI race and make profits for themselves and for their investors along the way.\n\nWhile investing in AI is considered to be the best way to invest in big tech in general by many investors, it isn't the only thing of interest going on in the big tech regime. Another thing to keep an eye on is the rapidity with which many major big tech companies are continuing to grow and assert their dominance in the market, apart from their AI endeavors. One example is Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) recent deal to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) for approximately $69 billion. Those concerned about the rapid growth of big tech companies, like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), have been opposed to this deal. However, on July 14, an appellant court judge in the US denied the FTC's bid to delay this deal, leaving Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) free to continue its expansion. On July 17, CNBC invited Big Technology founder Alex Kantrowitz to discuss this deal when he noted the following:\n\n\"I think it is priced in. I think that the markets have been watching what's been going on here and they've come to the conclusion that Microsoft's gonna win, probably in the last few weeks. So you'll see a small bump when this thing actually goes through but the real impact is gonna be long term, like let's see how Activision actually adds to the Microsoft set of gaming tools and it actually might end up impacting the business in the bottomline because once you put those two together there could be some significant growth. Some of these concerns that people have been bringing that Microsoft might corner off the competition or the Xbox might end up taking exclusivity on some of these games, that could actually come to fruition now and once that happens we could see something serious with the stock.\"\n\nThis type of expansion is something that is been seen across the tech industry in many companies in the form of deals, partnerships, and acquisitions, among much more. Many of these expansions are also relevant to the field of AI as tech companies continue to jump on the AI bandwagon this year. Due to all this, other renowned tech companies like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), and ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) are also setting the stage for themselves to join the big tech cohort of companies. Considering the popularity of the tech industry in 2023, many of these companies may even become some of the best long-term tech stocks to buy right now. Some may even be classified as undervalued tech stocks considering their future potential and current valuation. Keeping this in mind, we have compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy now.\n\nBest Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now\n\nPhoto by Alexandr Bormotin on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe picked large-cap tech stocks that are highly popular among hedge funds in 2023 for our list below, using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter when 943 hedge funds were tracked. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number.\n\nBest Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now\n\n13. Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 67\n\nOracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) is a systems software company based in Austin, Texas. It offers products and services addressing enterprise information technology environments globally. The company is considered to be part of the big tech cohort because of its widespread influence in the industry.\n\nMark Murphy, an analyst at JPMorgan, holds an Overweight rating on Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) shares as of June 13. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $109 to $112.\n\nOracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) was spotted in the portfolios of 67 hedge funds during the first quarter, with a total stake value of $2.9 billion.\n\nSciencast Management was the largest shareholder in Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) at the end of the first quarter, holding 3,950 shares in the company.\n\nAriel Investments mentioned Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAdditionally, global leader in enterprise software, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) traded higher in the quarter, driven by solid quarterly earnings, a material increase in the dividend as well as forward looking guidance that implies a substantial acceleration in organic cloud growth for full year 2023. We believe these results highlight ORCL\u2019s ability to effectively cross-sell and upsell apps and infrastructure, as well as the emergence of the company\u2019s cloud platform as a competitive offering.\u201d\n\nLike Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Oracle Corporation (NASDAQ:ORCL) is also one of the most renowned tech companies in the world today, making it popular with hedge funds.\n\n12. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\n\nAs of July 12, Matthew Ramsay at TD Cowen maintains an Outperform rating on shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $150 to $160.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California. The company provides x86 microprocessors and graphics processing units (GPUs), among more.\n\nThere were 91 hedge funds long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in the first quarter. Their total stake value was $4.9 billion.\n\nHorizon Kinetics LLC said the following about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its first-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt is among what are considered to be the great technology companies, like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel, that one is apt to see some of the greatest confusion between short-term financial results and share price movements, on the one hand, and long-term financial results. The former are exceedingly difficult to predict. Long term results are relatively easy to predict, because they are bound by the limiting realities of the business model. In the case of AMD, that is the business of being a large-scale semi-conductor manufacturer with a more dominant competitor that has a scale economy advantage. Here\u2019s what people see, remember and act upon. In the past several years, AMD has been the best performing major technology stock. It\u2019s outperformed Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidia\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 96\n\nHolding 1.5 million shares in the company, GQG Partners was the largest shareholder in ServiceNow, Inc.

He also announced a $660 price target on the stock.\n\nHere's what Lakehouse Capital said about ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) in its April 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDespite a difficult macro environment, US-based software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) proved resilient with a healthy combination of organic growth and profitability. Subscription revenues grew 24% year-on-year (27% constant currency) to $2.0 billion and operating income grew 26% year-on-year to $552 million. The company\u2019s core operating metrics were equally strong with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year and renewal rates holding firm at 98%. ServiceNow\u2019s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value. Overall, we continue to believe that ServiceNow is one of the highest quality software businesses around as the combination of consistent growth at scale, robust free cash flow generation and a large addressable market make it an attractive opportunity.\u201d\n\n10. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 99\n\nWe saw 99 hedge funds long Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) at the end of the first quarter.

The top five positive contributors to performance during the quarter were Moody\u2019s, Mastercard, CoStar, Constellation Software, and Adobe.\u201d\n\n9. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 102\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) had 102 hedge funds long its stock during the first quarter, with a total stake value of $8.9 billion.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is another semiconductor company on our list.

We retain conviction that Taiwan Semi\u2019s technological leadership; pricing power; and exposure to secular growth markets, including high-performance computing, automotive, 5G, and IoT; will allow the company to sustain strong earnings growth over the next several years.\u201d\n\n8. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is a provider of technology infrastructure and marketing reach for merchants, brands, retailers, and businesses. It operates an e-commerce platform and is based in Hangzhou, China.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) was spotted in the 13F holdings of 128 hedge funds in the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $5.9 billion.\n\nColin Sebastian, an analyst at Baird, reiterated an Outperform rating on shares of Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) on July 17. The analyst also maintains a $115 price target on the stock.\n\nHere's what Oakmark Funds said about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its second-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) (China) was the top detractor for the quarter. Sentiment in Chinese equities has degraded after the initial excitement from China\u2019s reopening earlier in the year. Incremental macroeconomic data coming out of China indicates that the Covid-19 re-opening bounce is fading, and the economy is struggling to sustain healthy growth. Political tensions between the U.S. and China are also further weighing on investor sentiment. As the largest e-commerce platform in China, Alibaba\u2019s share price has been caught up in this storm. The company has also continued to face intense competition from the likes of short video players and traditional e-commerce companies. Indeed, Alibaba has lost market share, which we expect will continue. But despite these negative factors, it remains an extremely important platform in China and continues to generate significant free cash flow. In the most recent completed fiscal year, the company generated $25B of free cash flow, which is 12% of the current market capitalization. Today, its core commerce business trades at approximately 5x EBITA, a valuation we deem much too cheap, even with the headwinds noted above. But valuation alone is often not enough to unlock value. Alibaba\u2019s management team is proactively working for minority shareholders. The company has been aggressive with share repurchases and with the recent formation of a capital management committee. Our conversations with the company indicate there is a high probability that more shareholder returns will be coming. In addition, the company recently announced a major restructuring that will effectively break up the company and separately list various businesses within Alibaba. Today, the market is assigning little to no value to these businesses and having a market quote may force investors to give Alibaba value for these assets. Whether or not the restructuring works, we appreciate management\u2019s efforts to help unlock value in what is clearly an undervalued stock.\u201d\n\n7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nAs of July 17, Erik Woodring, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, maintains an Overweight rating on shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). The analyst also raised his firm's price target on the stock from $190 to $220.\n\nIn total, 131 hedge funds held stakes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the end of the first quarter, with a total stake value of $165.2 billion.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the main big tech companies in the US market. It operates as a technology hardware, storage, and peripherals company and is based in Cupertino, California. The company is best known for its smartphone brand, iPhone.\n\nThe following is a comment from Manole Capital Management's second-quarter 2023 investor letter about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cDespite this, the S&P 500 is up 7% this year and the Nasdaq is up +11%.

Nvidia rose after reporting strong results and forecasting significantly higher data center revenues for the coming quarter, driven by rising artificial intelligence investments around the world. When we are successful in achieving disproportionate equity outcomes, we need a process for managing them. Entering this year, we had a ~6.5% position in Nvidia. Due to the enthusiasm for generative AI and a rapid conclusion to \u201ccloud optimization,\u201d the stock has surged 189.5% this year including 52.31% in Q2. We retained an investment in Nvidia with less capital at risk, an approach which afforded us the potential to prudently participate in excellent investments over long periods of time. Notably, despite our gradual position reductions, Nvidia has contributed 1491bps to performance since inception. In turn, these value pathways form the foundation upon which our risk management framework rests, and put us in position to execute our investment program in future periods of duress.\u201d\n\nLike Adobe Inc.

The losses were primarily influenced by the difficult market circumstances for high-risk assets, particularly impacting hedge funds with a long-biased approach and/or higher volatility. This marked the weakest performance for the hedge fund industry since 2018 when it also posted a 2.4% loss. Looking at the five-year performance, hedge funds have achieved a compounded annual return of +4.2%, demonstrating a more favorable performance compared to bonds, which experienced a decline of 2.0%. Aurum, a hedge fund investment specialist, noted that there were clear winners and losers in the hedge fund industry in 2022. The best-performing strategies were multi-strategy (+9.5%), quant (+8.5%), and macro (+6.7%). Strategies that typically have a higher correlation to equities and fixed income, which experienced poor performance, struggled the most.\n\nPatrick Ghali, managing partner of hedge fund advisory firm Sussex Partners, told Reuters on January 10, 2023:\n\n\"Investors need to look under the surface to understand the industry performance last year.

Smaller funds generally outperformed larger ones, as indicated by the median return of -2.86%. HFR also highlighted that macro strategies, including fundamental commodity, discretionary, and quantitative trend-following CTA sub-strategies, were the leading hedge fund strategies globally.\n\nDespite the dull performance of hedge funds, Citadel, led by Ken Griffin, achieved an exceptional feat by generating an unprecedented $16 billion in profits for its clients in 2022. This performance not only surpassed other players in the industry but also stands as one of the most prominent financial successes in history. Chairman Rick Sopher of LCH Investments commented:\n\n\u201cThe largest gains were once again made by the large multi-strategy hedge funds like Citadel, DE Shaw and Millennium. The strong gains they have generated in recent years reflect their increasing dominance in strategies which do not depend on rising asset prices, and their substantial size.\u201d\n\nIndividual investors often look up to elite hedge funds and try to imitate their performance.

(NYSE:WMT) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds.\n\nIn its Q2 2021 investor letter, ClearBridge Investments, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has created challenges for businesses large and small; one major challenge for large essential retailers such as ClearBridge holdings Home Depot, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Costco have been ensuring adequate staffing to meet demand under trying conditions. All three instituted enhanced pay practices during the pandemic, with raises, unplanned bonuses and other benefits helping compensate employees for their efforts in a difficult environment. In September 2020 Walmart raised wages for 165,000 employees, including a number of entry positions to $15 an hour. It followed this in February with a raise for 425,000 workers that moved its average pay above $15 an hour.\u201d\n\n24. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 91\n\nBank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) provides banking and financial products and services.

JPMorgan Chase comes to mind especially here, but so does Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) despite its weakness in March, as well as U.S. Bancorp, to which we added opportunistically in the quarter.\u201d\n\n23. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 95\n\nOn June 27, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock saw a slight increase in pre-market trading after Bank of America expressed confidence in the company's strategic direction. Despite concerns regarding the box office, streaming business, and other challenges, analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich maintained a Buy rating and set a price target of $135 on the shares. The analyst acknowledged that some recent content, including the Pixar film Elemental, did not meet audience expectations, but attributed this to production circumstances during the pandemic and past leadership.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. According to Insider Monkey\u2019s first quarter database, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) was part of 95 hedge fund portfolios, with Nelson Peltz\u2019s Trian Partners holding the largest stake, consisting of 5.9 million shares worth $592.4 million.\n\nVGI Partners made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its 2022 annual investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a diversified media conglomerate operating media networks, theme parks, film and TV studios and direct-to-consumer streaming services. It is the global leader in theme parks with hotels and cruise lines aimed at families. Key assets within Disney are the instantly recognisable entertainment franchises that have multiple avenues of monetisation such as Mickey Mouse, Star Wars, ABC and Marvel\u2019s Avengers. Disney\u2019s share price declined due to a number of factors in 2022, presenting us the chance to purchase a long-admired business and its unique collection of valuable intellectual property assets at what we consider to be a very attractive valuation. Summarily, the EPS of Disney has declined from US$7 in 2018 to ~US$2.60 in 2022 but we believe that the earnings power of the assets has not diminished to anywhere near this extent. Disney is currently undergoing a business transition within the Media and Entertainment Distribution division (DMED) from traditional media property distribution via third parties (i.e. cinemas and broadcast networks) to a Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) model via the Disney+ streaming service. A key element of our thesis is that the earnings power of the company is currently being masked by the marketing and content investments within Disney+ and that this will normalize over the next several years. To put this in perspective, Disney+ (DTC sub-segment) currently generates operating losses of over US$3.3bn (a negative 14% operating margin) compared to operating margins at its nearest streaming competitor, Netflix, of +15.5%\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 96\n\nServiceNow, Inc.

(NYSE:NOW), compared to 97 funds in the prior quarter.

(NYSE:NOW) in its April 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDespite a difficult macro environment, US-based software company ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) proved resilient with a healthy combination of organic growth and profitability. Subscription revenues grew 24% year-on-year (27% constant currency) to $2.0 billion and operating income grew 26% year-on-year to $552 million. The company\u2019s core operating metrics were equally strong with remaining performance obligations growing 24% year-on-year and renewal rates holding firm at 98%. ServiceNow\u2019s renewal rates are noteworthy as not only are they best-in-class but they are also remarkably consistent, typically in the range of 97% to 99%. They speak to the mission critical nature of the platform and are a key driver of long term annuity value. Overall, we continue to believe that ServiceNow is one of the highest quality software businesses around as the combination of consistent growth at scale, robust free cash flow generation and a large addressable market make it an attractive opportunity.\u201d\n\n21.

(NYSE:TMO) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we also raised our position in Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO). The company effectively sells pickaxes and shovels to the life sciences industry, is well balanced, is durable, and has a strong management team at the helm. We took an initial position recently and are now raising it to an average weight within the Portfolio. During the most recent quarter, the company grew revenue 11% in constant currency. Core organic growth, excluding COVID-19 testing revenue which fell 16%, grew a very strong 13%. This company plays an important role within the Portfolio as a \u201csafety\u201d within our growth spectrum approach and over the next five years we expect EBITDA and EPS to grow at roughly low double digits and low teens, respectively.\u201d\n\n20. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 99\n\nAdobe Inc.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe increased our position in marketing and design software maker Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). The company is protecting its leadership position by moving quickly into generative AI and license protection. It developed Firefly into a product that can be monetized, moving AI from a previously perceived risk into an opportunity.\u201d\n\n19. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 102\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. On July 6, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stated that it anticipates no significant repercussions on its business after China's recent restrictions on gallium and germanium exports.

PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 103\n\nPayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is another stock favored by hedge funds. On June 20, KKR & Co. Inc. (NYSE:KKR) announced that it will purchase up to \u20ac40 billion of buy now, pay later (BNPL) loan receivables amassed by PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. PayPal will still carry out customer-facing operations, including underwriting and servicing associated with its European BNPL products. This arrangement alleviates some risk off PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)\u2019s balance sheet and frees up cash.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s first quarter database, 103 hedge funds were bullish on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), compared to 115 funds in the prior quarter. D E Shaw is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 5.6 million shares worth $426 million.\n\nManole Capital Management made the following comment about PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cFor our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%. Over the last several years, P2P payments have made tremendous strides in adoption and usage. Whenever something becomes a verb, like just Venmo me $10, you know that it has been widely embraced by society. The concept of allowing individuals to pay each other, via our smartphones, has clearly taken off. However, the biggest flaw or issue (that we\u2019ve identified) is interoperability. Digital wallets allow users to pick their favorite card to make payments with. P2P acts as a bit of a \u201cwalled garden\u201d and its funding source is still siloed. This is a critical aspect for future P2P growth, as Venmo users can\u2019t pay Cash App users who can\u2019t pay Zelle users. Visa is launching Visa+ next year and it has already signed up PayPal and Venmo as its initial customers. The global card networks seem like the perfect piece to solve this interoperability puzzle. Of course, this will only work if banks allow an independent network to serve as the gateway between disparate user bases\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 108\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a favorite stock among elite hedge funds. On July 10, Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne maintained an Equal Weight rating on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and raised the price target on the shares to $450 from $350. The analyst noted that Netflix will potentially gain 2.2 million subscribers in the second-quarter, up from 1.55 million, given a \"more modest churn\" from the paid sharing announcements in the US and Canada, in addition to \"solid\" app download projections. He now forecasts advertising supported subscriptions to be approximately 30 million by the end of 2025, slightly lesser than anticipated.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s first quarter database, 108 hedge funds were bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), compared to 117 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nArtisan Developing World Fund made the following comment about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cTop contributors to performance for the quarter included global streaming giant Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Netflix benefited from the success of the new ad tier that allows users to access the service at a lower price, and from the paid sharing initiative that allows multiple users to share an account for an additional fee.\u201d\n\n16. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 108\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. On July 10, Berkshire Hathaway Energy agreed to purchase Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D)\u2019s 50% stake in the Cove Point LNG plant in Maryland in a deal worth $3.3 billion. Berkshire already owns a 25% limited partner interest in Cove Point LNG, and the company will own a 75% stake after the deal finalizes.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s first quarter database, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) was found in 108 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 110 in the last quarter. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth just over $6 billion.\n\n15. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is an American multinational financial services company that operates through Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking, and Asset & Wealth Management segments. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a highly favored stock by hedge funds. On May 15, the company declared a $1 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on July 31, to shareholders of record as of July 6.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s first quarter database, 112 hedge funds were long JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), compared to 100 funds in the earlier quarter. Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel Investment Group is the biggest stakeholder of the company.\n\nManole Capital Management made the following comment about JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see what kind of policy decisions are made around regulation for institutions that are between $100 billion of assets and $700 billion of assets. As JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM)\u2019s purchase of First Republic shows, scale is a competitive advantage. It now has 13% of total US deposits and it manages 21% of America\u2019s credit card spending. With additional regulatory burdens coming, banks are facing a profitability headwind and 100 to 300 basis points of possible ROE erosion. The banking sector is facing a slow-moving crisis, but we aren\u2019t sure it is enough to sink the overall health of the US consumer or economy. Credit will contract and lending standards will continue to rise. However, we do not see this problem escalating to the size and scale of previous banking crises. Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JP Morgan Chase clearly sees the risks these FINTECH companies present. In his annual letter to shareholders, he stated that all incumbent banks should be \u201cscared shitless\u201d of these FINTECH rivals. Not only is his bank being attacked from multiple angles, but Apple just launched a cash management program with Goldman Sachs. On the first day of Apple\u2019s savings program, it raised $400 million and eclipsed $1 billion in its first four days. Dimon specifically labeled Apple a bank the other day in an interview when he said, \u201cIt may not have insured deposits, but it\u2019s a bank. If you move money, hold money, manage money, lend money \u2014 that\u2019s a bank.\u201d\n\n14. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 116\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified healthcare company in the United States. On June 26, Amedisys, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMED), a Louisiana-based healthcare provider, decided to terminate its prior merger agreement with Option Care Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPCH) and instead entered into a new merger agreement with UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). Under the new agreement, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) will acquire Amedisys for $101 per share in cash.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. Insider Monkey\u2019s first quarter database indicated that 116 hedge funds were bullish on the stock, up from 110 in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDuring the March 2023 quarter, while share prices changed, the change was largely in one direction, up, for companies in our Portfolio and on our Bench. We did take advantage of improving sentiment to higher growth technology companies and the share price of more defensive companies drifting down to divest our investment in Adobe and increase the Fund\u2019s investment in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH). United Health\u2019s share price was also under moderate pressure due to regulatory announcements being very slightly adverse. We believe the market over-reacted to these announcements and the share price has recovered strongly over recent weeks.\u201d\n\n13. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is one of the most owned stocks by smart investors. On July 7, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) introduced its text-to-image model called Tongyi Wanxiang, which utilizes generative AI technology.

Alibaba operates shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall and owns 33% of Ant Group, which operates Alipay, China\u2019s largest third-party online payment provider. Shares of Alibaba were up this quarter, given meaningful margin expansion, guidance to stabilize core commerce market share in China, and an announced plan to split the company into six units which could further unlock value. We retain conviction that Alibaba is well positioned to benefit from China\u2019s reopening and the ongoing growth in online commerce and cloud in China.\u201d\n\n12. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 128\n\nActivision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) develops and publishes interactive entertainment content. It is one of the favorite stocks of elite hedge funds. On July 11, Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) stock climbed 5% after a federal court granted Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) permission to proceed with its acquisition of the video game company for $69 billion. The court's decision came despite a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission in an attempt to prevent the acquisition from taking place.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s first quarter database, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest position holder in Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), with 49.4 million shares worth $4.2 billion.\n\nKinsman Oak Capital Partners made the following comment about Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe closed our long position in Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) on the last trading day of the quarter. We initiated the position in November 2021 and, despite crystalizing a gain on the investment, we are admittedly a little frustrated with how this has played out. In January 2022, Microsoft (MSFT) agreed to acquire the company for $95/share, but regulators are determined to block the transaction, and appear increasingly activist, in our opinion.\u201d\n\n11. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nAt the end of June 2023, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s valuation surpassed $3 trillion, solidifying its position as the world's most valuable company. Citi analyst Atif Malik, who initiated coverage of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a Buy rating and a price target of $240, noted that investors are underestimating the potential for gross margin expansion by the tech giant. Malik also emphasized Apple's consistent market share gains over Android smartphones, its favorable position with the higher-end iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max models, continuous growth in China and India, the addition of high-margin Services revenue, and cost-cutting measures through chip development.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s first quarter database, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 915.5 million shares worth approximately $151 billion. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a popular choice in the stock portfolios of elite hedge funds.\n\nManole Capital Management made the following comment about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cDespite this, the S&P 500 is up 7% this year and the Nasdaq is up +11%. Technology rebounded from a challenging 2022 and many large tech companies are performing quite well this year. Through mid-May 2023, year-to-date performance of some of the most popular and largest tech names is impressive. For tech companies with market capitalizations over $1 trillion, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is up +35%, Microsoft +33%, Amazon +39%, and Google is +40%. In terms of contribution to the S&P 500\u2019s year-to-date return, Apple and Microsoft represent roughly half of its 2023 performance. Apple, and Microsoft now account for 13.9% of the entire S&P 500 or 80% more concentrated than 2008. For additional perspective, Apple\u2019s market cap is at $2.8 trillion and that is larger than the market cap of the entire Russell 2000. To conclude, it\u2019s distinctly getting more concentrated at the top. For our purposes, we are just going to focus on software digital wallets, as they are much more common and accessible. If you own an iPhone, then you have an Apple Pay preloaded digital wallet. If you have a Samsung phone, you have Samsung Pay available for use. Those two, along with Google Pay and PayPal, are the four most popular digital wallets today. According to the Payments Journal, PayPal has been used (over the last 12 months) by 62% of American consumers, followed by Apple Pay at 41% and Google Pay at 32%. Digital wallets have tons of advantages that we are embracing. When we attend Tampa Bay Lightning games, we love having our season tickets easily accessible on our phones (via the Apple Pay wallet), as well as our timed parking pass. When we travel, loading the airline ticket into our Apple Pay wallet is much more convenient than printing out a paper boarding pass. Others are using digital wallets to track their expenses, budget properly, and even help them easily pay their bills. Digital wallets are still in their infancy and have decades of future growth; we believe the smartphone is simply the best interface and platform for digital wallets\u2026\u201d (Click here to read the full text)\n\n10. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 132\n\nNVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), an American semiconductor giant, is one of the most owned stocks among smart investors. On July 10, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reaffirmed a Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and expressed confidence in the company's advancement in the field of general artificial intelligence. The analyst also raised the firm's price target for Nvidia shares from $440 to $495, citing the notable growth in data center revenue, which implies a significant advancement for the company in this new phase.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s first quarter database, 132 hedge funds were bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), compared to 106 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain\u2019s GQG Partners is a significant stakeholder of the company, with 8.2 million shares worth $2.3 billion.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe Strategy\u2019s IT holdings also drove performance in the second quarter, led by the continued rerating of graphics chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a key beneficiary of the generative AI boom. Nvidia is a good example of a select growth stock bought opportunistically where our long-term thesis has bloomed. We initiated the position in the fourth quarter of 2018 knowing that inference and training in the data center was an interesting although still early-stage growth driver. We knew that GPUs could be used to solve complex computing problems, but we didn\u2019t know how quickly the training and learning efforts by Nvidia\u2019s mega cap customers would hit an inflection point. Volatility in the gaming business created the entry point into the stock and we have built the position accordingly over time. Since the end of 2021, the stock\u2019s portfolio weight grew from 4.5% to a high of 7.2% earlier in the second quarter before we trimmed it to manage our overall position sizing. We will continue to monitor and adjust Nvidia\u2019s position sizing to manage risk. Despite the sharp run up, we believe the company\u2019s long-term runway remains compelling due to its advantaged positioning in a very large addressable market for GPUs. The current valuation looks expensive, yet Nvidia has real earnings and cash flow and the longer-term multiple looks more reasonable because of GPU pricing power.\u201d\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 136\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is an American tech company specializing in customer relationship management. On June 29, Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) revealed its plans to invest $4 billion in its U.K. business over the span of five years, with the aim of enhancing artificial intelligence innovation. This investment follows a previous announcement in 2018, where the company committed $2.5 billion over five years.\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stock is famous among hedge funds. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, 136 hedge funds were bullish on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), compared to 117 funds in the earlier quarter. Harris Associates is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 7.7 million shares worth $1.5 billion.\n\nIthaka US Growth Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is the largest pure-play cloud software company, holding a leading market share in customer relationship management applications and a top-five market share position in the company\u2019s other clouds (Marketing, Service, Platform, Analytics, Integration, and Commerce). The company\u2019s software subscription term-license model differs from the traditional perpetual-license software model in two respects: (1) the software is hosted on centralized servers and delivered over the internet, as opposed to traditional enterprise software that is loaded directly onto customers\u2019 hard drives or servers; and (2) the revenue model is subscription-based, typically charging monthly fees per user as opposed to charging one-time licensing fees. The stock\u2019s strong relative performance followed a strong F4Q23 earnings release that easily beat Street expectations on the top- and bottom-lines. In addition to the beat, management announced a number of initiatives that activist investors have been clamoring for, specifically a halt to large M&A transactions and a focus on operating profitability.\u201d\n\n8. Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 138\n\nMastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) engages in transaction processing and provides payment-related products and services worldwide.

We are FINTECH investors, and we define Fintech as \u201canything utilizing technology to improve an established process.\u201d We realize that half of Fintech is financial, but we don\u2019t invest in traditional, credit sensitive banks. Having managed money during the Financial Crisis, we learned firsthand how certain opaque and balance sheet intensive financials could go bankrupt or insolvent. We prefer transaction-based businesses, generating recurring revenue, with sustainable margins, and significant cash flow. From our perspective, the perfect example of a FINTECH business is the secularly growing payments industry. Names like Visa or Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), that generate revenue and profit per swipe or transaction, without the underlying credit sensitivity or risk associated with that underlying line of credit.\u201d\n\n7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 144\n\nUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is an American mobility technology firm. On May 24, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) outlined its strategy to introduce 25,000 electric vehicles in India as part of its initiative called Uber Green. The company intends to collaborate with local fleet operators and enhance financing options to facilitate this plan. Alongside the addition of 25,000 electric cars to the Uber platform in India, Uber also aims to deploy 10,000 electric two-wheelers in Delhi by 2024 in collaboration with EV startup Zypp Electric.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s first quarter database, 144 hedge funds were bullish on Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), compared to 135 funds in the earlier quarter.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cUber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): Uber was a top contributor in the quarter following better-than-expected 4Q results and 1Q guidance. Gross Bookings grew 19% year over year to $31 billion, driven by 31% Mobility Gross Bookings growth and 6% Delivery Growth Bookings growth. 4Q Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million, up $579 million year over year, significantly beating management\u2019s $600-$630 million guidance. Management guided to continuing growth in 1Q for Gross Bookings (20%- 24% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $660-$700 million). UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 131 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, truck brokerage (the company had $1.5 billion in Freight revenue for 4Q22), and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4 billion of unrestricted cash and $5 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $70 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 1.6x next year\u2019s estimated revenue.\u201d\n\n6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 155\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds. On July 6, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) disclosed that it has decided to postpone the launch of its first custom processor for Pixel smartphones by at least one year. The company had initially planned to release the chip in 2024, aiming to replace Samsung-made processors. However, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has now revised its strategy and will continue to rely on Samsung for processors until 2025, after which it plans to introduce its fully customized chip.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s first quarter data, Harris Associates is the largest Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stakeholder, with 36.90 million shares worth $3.8 billion.\n\nLike Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the most owned stocks by hedge funds.\n\nOakmark Global Select Fund made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (U.S.) was the top contributor to the Fund\u2019s performance for the quarter. Alphabet\u2019s first-quarter search revenue growth accelerated slightly sequentially, which was notable given that advertising spending has decreased across the board. Management cited the company\u2019s travel and retail segments for their strong performance in contrast to the declines experienced in the finance and in the media and entertainment businesses. Advertising spending has also stabilized at YouTube, and the focus on \u201cshorts\u201d has driven strong viewership growth. In the near term, YouTube\u2019s investment in shorts may not generate significant revenue, but we believe its profitability will accelerate over time. Alphabet\u2019s cloud business reached GAAP profitability this quarter, moving from a -12% margin this quarter last year to a 3% margin this quarter. On the AI front, Alphabet upgraded Bard to run on its more powerful PaLM language model, and Bard can now assist with coding and software development. CEO Sundar Pichai compared AI\u2019s evolution to the transition from desktop to mobile computing a decade ago and said there is \u201ca lot more to come\u201d in terms of its consumer AI applications. CFO Ruth Porat revised 2023 capital expenditures guidance due to higher spending on data center construction and servers that will support AI developments in consumer products, advertiser tools and the cloud business. Porat reiterated that the company plans to continue to hold expense growth below revenue growth and that Alphabet\u2019s cost-reduction initiatives should bear fruit later this year and into 2024. At Alphabet\u2019s annual developer conference in May, the company showcased an impressive array of new AI-powered consumer tools, which will be rolled out over the course of the year. Investors reacted positively to these presentations, which highlighted the extent of AI innovation occurring at Alphabet.\u201d\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nDisclosure: None. 25 Most Owned Stocks by Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.", "tiktoken_token_count": 9160, "llama_token_count": 11745}, {"source_name": "Tampa Bay Times", "author": "Tampa Bay Times, St. Petersburg, Fla.", "title": "Pitt still raving about football IQ of Bucs\u2019 Calijah Kancey, SirVocea Dennis", "description": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 As Bucs rookies Calijah Kancey and SirVocea Dennis go through their first NFL training camp, their college coach expects them to have no problem understanding the schemes and plays at the next level. \u201cIf I had to pick the smartest guy in the\u2026", "url": "https://www.tampabay.com/sports/bucs/2023/07/27/calijah-kancey-sirvocea-dennis-sean-tucker-pitt-football-nfl-rookies/", "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 As Bucs rookies Calijah Kancey and SirVocea Dennis go through their first NFL training camp, their college coach expects them to have no problem understanding the schemes and plays at the next level.\n\n\u201cIf I had to pick the smartest guy in the last eight years at Pitt on defense, on the defensive line and linebacker, those are the two guys,\u201d Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi said during the ACC\u2019s football media days at The Westin Charlotte. \u201cThat\u2019s what you got. In intelligence, those guys are going to know before the ball\u2019s snapped kind of what the offense likes to do in that situation.\u201d\n\nBucs general manager Jason Licht cited Kancey\u2019s intelligence as one reason why Tampa Bay took the All-America defensive lineman in the first round (No. 19 overall). His physical talent was obvious, too. Though undersized at 6-feet-1, 281 pounds, Kancey is strong and explosive. His 14\u00bd tackles for a loss last year were the most among all interior linemen.\n\nPitt offensive tackle Matt Goncalves \u2014 one of the ACC\u2019s top returning linemen \u2014 said there were times in practice when he tried to double-team Kancey but already found him three steps into the backfield.\n\nMore importantly, Goncalves said, was the passion Kancey showed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the most respected players I\u2019ve ever played with, for sure,\u201d Goncalves said.\n\nDefensive back M.J. Devonshire can explain why. Though Devonshire was much faster than Kancey \u2014 as he should be, given his position and 190-pound frame \u2014 Kancey lined up next to him and the other defensive backs to race them in every sprint.\n\n\u201cHe knew he had to do things that other people couldn\u2019t because of what they thought he lacked,\u201d Devonshire said, \u201cso he just worked 10 times harder to prove that he was better than what they thought.\u201d\n\nDennis wasn\u2019t a superstar recruit, either \u2014 he was a two-star recruit and the nation\u2019s No. 3,111 prospect \u2014 but blossomed into an all-ACC linebacker and fifth-round pick (No. 153 overall) thanks to his blend of intelligence and athleticism. Devonshire raves about Dennis\u2019 recall and ability to break down an offense in real time.\n\nThat showed up in one of the craziest plays Devonshire has ever seen, against Clemson in 2021. Dennis split a pair of offensive linemen to get in the backfield, then intercepted a shovel pass for a 50-yard touchdown in the Panthers\u2019 10-point win.\n\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\u2019s college football teams every day.

But he recognizes how his experience and status as a Pro Bowl player with a Super Bowl ring gives him the credentials to lead.\n\n\u201cObviously, when you have a new offense, it allows guys to step up in different ways,\u201d receiver Chris Godwin said. \u201cYou (need) guys to be leaders in different phases. I think Tristan is doing a really good job being a leader this year. You can hear him being a bit more vocal and you would expect that. He\u2019s one of the best offensive tackles in the league. He\u2019s a dominant guy, a big guy and people listen.\u201d\n\nOne of those listening is Mayfield, who forged a fast friendship with the guy who will protect his blindside.

It isn't the first time.\n\nThe Seahawks have been unconventional for years and it always works out. They pushed it to the limit last season. They traded Russell Wilson, who made nine Pro Bowls in 10 Seahawks seasons, to the Denver Broncos. Teams do not trade franchise quarterbacks in their prime, but the Seahawks did. They didn't do much to replace Wilson either. The football world chuckled that their QB battle would be between Geno Smith and Drew Lock.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been successful for a long time and we\u2019re proud of that,\u201d Carroll said in March 2022, according to the Seattle Times. \u201cWe know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThat's hard to deny. The Seahawks looked very smart by the end of the season, making the doubters look dumb. Wilson fell apart in Denver, though poor coaching didn't help that. Smith won the job in preseason and had a remarkable year. It was the kind of career revival you don't see often. The Seahawks had all of those draft picks from the Wilson trade and ended up with the better quarterback, at least for last season.\n\nThe Seahawks spent all offseason getting ridiculed, then made the playoffs. It was inexplicable that a team could trade a nine-time Pro Bowl quarterback, replace him with a 32-year-old washout who hadn't started regularly since 2014, and get better. But the Seahawks did it.\n\nCarroll, and general manager John Schneider, proved everyone wrong again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t get it,\u201d Carroll said on KIRO-AM during last season, via The Athletic. \u201cI love to show them. I love to prove it to them.\u201d\n\nIt's not like the Seahawks are back to their 2012-14 heights yet. There's work to be done. Seattle did go just 9-8 and caught a break to make the playoffs when the Detroit Lions beat the Green Bay Packers in the final game of the regular season. The defense gave up too many big plays. Fair or not, Smith will need to prove last season wasn't a fluke. The Seahawks were blasted three times last season by NFC West rival San Francisco, including in a wild-card playoff game.\n\nBut let's assume Carroll has a good plan.\n\nSeattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll's faith in quarterback Geno Smith was rewarded last season. (Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images)\n\nSeattle's surprising season was led by Smith's career year and a draft class that will bolster the Seahawks going forward. They hit on many picks, and it didn't hurt to have all those Broncos picks. Then this year's draft haul got the fourth-best average grade among analysts, via Football Outsiders. If that draft hits like experts think it did, Seattle will be in good shape for a while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Seahawks are set up to be pretty good for the next few years, though it's worth wondering how much longer Carroll will be around. He's 71 years old and very few coaches have lasted that long. But he also knows that taking another group to a Super Bowl, after moving on from a franchise quarterback, would solidify his Hall of Fame resume.\n\nCarroll's ability shouldn't be questioned after what he pulled off last season after trading Wilson. He knows what he's doing.\n\nOffseason grade\n\nThe Seahawks got better this offseason. Maybe much better. They signed defensive lineman Dre'Mont Jones to a three-year deal worth more than $51 million. Safety Julian Love and defensive lineman Jarran Reed were added on smaller deals. Then came a fun reunion, with linebacker Bobby Wagner rejoining the team after one season on the Los Angeles Rams. Wagner had the top Pro Football Focus grade among all linebackers last season. Those were much-needed additions to the defense. There were no crucial losses either. Then the draft class, bolstered by picks from the Broncos, looked very good. Cornerback Devon Witherspoon was added with the fifth overall pick (thanks, Denver), and with the 20th pick Seattle took Jaxon Smith-Njigba, the top receiver in the class. In the second round the Seahawks added edge rusher Derick Hall and running back Zach Charbonnet. Seattle did all that and still was able to re-sign quarterback Geno Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrade: A\n\nQuarterback report\n\nGeno Smith was fantastic in a Week 1 win over the Broncos, completing 23-of-28 passes for 195 yards and two touchdowns. After years of languishing as a backup, it was his time in the sun.\n\n\"They wrote me off. I ain't write back though,\" Smith said in a memorable quote to ESPN.\n\nAnd it was supposed to fall apart after that. It didn't. Smith, who failed quickly as a second-round pick of the New York Jets, maintained a high level all season. He led the NFL in completion percentage. He threw for 4,282 yards, 30 touchdowns and had a 100.9 passer rating. That rating was better than Joe Burrow and Josh Allen, among others. He signed a three-year, $75 million deal (with $30 million more possible in incentives) in the offseason to stay in Seattle. It was one of the best stories in the NFL last season, and there's no great reason to believe Smith can't repeat it.\n\nBetMGM odds breakdown\n\nI'll take the Seahawks at +195 at BetMGM to win the NFC West (those odds have come down significantly over the offseason). They made the playoffs last season and then got better this offseason. There is the concern about the way the 49ers dominated them last season, but San Francisco's quarterback questions and the odds have me taking the Seahawks. I'll also take the over on 8.5 wins and for Seattle to make the playoffs at -120. This Seahawks team is poised for a nice season.\n\nYahoo's fantasy take\n\nFrom Yahoo's Scott Pianowski: \"Tyler Lockett is a little pricier in Yahoo leagues than he is in national ADP, but that doesn\u2019t faze me. He fits one of my favorite fantasy themes, the boring value veteran who is priced for profit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Lockett\u2019s end-of-year ranks in standard leagues have been remarkably consistent over the last five seasons: WR11 WR15, WR11, WR11, WR13. And yet you can still land him as the WR20 in early Yahoo drafts. I get that he\u2019s entering his age-31 season, and the Seahawks have other buzzy receivers on the roster \u2014 alpha DK Metcalf, and rookie hotshot Jaxon Smith-Njigba. But Seattle\u2019s target tree is fairly narrow \u2014 the tight ends and running backs don\u2019t catch a lot of passes \u2014 and QB Geno Smith earned circle of trust privileges last year. This offense can support multiple wide receivers. I am confident Lockett will be a proactive part of my 2023 fantasy portfolio.\"\n\nStat to remember\n\nSeattle's pass defense was average last season. It was 13th in passing yards allowed, 14th in passing TDs allowed and 13th in passer rating allowed. The pass D was 17th in Football Outsiders' DVOA. That's an area in which the Seahawks could make a jump. Adding cornerback Devon Witherspoon, the fifth overall pick, to go with 2022 rookie surprise Tariq Woolen could give the Seahawks an elite cornerback duo. At safety, Quandre Diggs is very good and the team added Julian Love in free agency. The difference between the secondary being good and great could be Jamal Adams. Adams suffered a season-ending quad injury in Week 1 last season. If the three-time Pro Bowler can rebound, he's a playmaker and disruptor at strong safety. He'd add to the depth and versatility of the secondary.\n\n\"It's an area that I'm really fired up about,\" coach Pete Carroll said about his secondary, via the team's site.\n\nBurning question\n\nHow will the Seahawks' skill-position players fit together?\n\nThere were some chuckles when the Seahawks used a second-round pick on running back Zach Charbonnet. The Seahawks had Kenneth Walker III coming off a strong rookie season. But of course the Seahawks used a high pick on another back. Again, they're unconventional. Now how will Walker and Charbonnet fit together? Walker had a lot of negative runs but was also a big-play threat every time he touched the ball. He finished with 1,050 yards last season. Charbonnet will probably be a more consistent runner and he's better in the passing game. Walker was very good last season and should start off with a bigger share of the snaps, but if the Seahawks are willing to trade big plays for reliability then Charbonnet could change that split during the season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe receiver room is crowded too. DK Metcalf will be the No. 1 receiver but there is some overlap between the skill sets of Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Smith-Njigba is a very good prospect, but Lockett has been a productive player for years. Lockett won't be phased out of the Seahawks offense. It's hard to figure out how Metcalf, Lockett and Smith-Njigba all get enough targets to reach 1,000 yards, especially on a team that still likes to run the ball.\n\nBest-case scenario\n\nWe're starting to get to the point in the countdown in which, if you squint hard enough, you can see a Super Bowl upside with these teams. Seattle's offense should be excellent if rookies Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Zach Charbonnet make an impact right away. The defense added several starters in the draft and free agency. If the offense reaches its full potential \u2014 and that relies heavily on two second-year tackles improving upon promising rookie seasons \u2014 and the defense improves greatly with some personnel improvements, why can't the Seahawks compete for an NFC title? They still have to figure out the 49ers, but they won't be intimidated by the rest of the conference if they do so. If this draft class hits like last year's did, the Seahawks could be really good.\n\nNightmare scenario\n\nGeno Smith wouldn't be the first quarterback to catch lightning in a bottle, then crash hard the following year. Before last season Smith had 34 career touchdowns, 37 interceptions and was six years down the backup QB path of his career. Maybe he's a Rich Gannon, who was very good for multiple seasons late in his career with the Raiders, but it wouldn't shock anyone if he faded back to mediocrity. If that happens the Seahawks could struggle and also look at a fun, young roster and realize that they still have a huge hole at the most important position.\n\nThe crystal ball says ...\n\nThe Seahawks will be fun. The offense should be explosive. The defense is going to be better. It's a bit of a leap to believe Seattle can take the NFC West from the 49ers, but the NFL is full of surprises every season. Maybe I'm being too optimistic on the Seahawks being much better this season, but I can see them winning the division and maybe a playoff game or two. It's never a bad idea to bet on Pete Carroll's Seahawks exceeding expectations.\n\nPrevious previews\n\n32. Arizona Cardinals\n\nAdvertisement\n\n31. Houston Texans\n\n30. Chicago Bears\n\n29.

Matthew Stafford, Los Angeles Rams\n\nThe biggest question surrounding Matthew Stafford right now is his health. Can he rebound after a serious, season-ending injury a year ago? On top of that, can he find any sort of success on a team with a decimated roster and 26 signed undrafted free agents?\n\nThe arm is still there to thread the eye of a needle, just as he did to win the Super Bowl just two years ago. However, Stafford faces a long and uphill battle to make a dent in the NFC West as the Rams have all but torn down their roster around him.\n\n12. Kyler Murray, Arizona Cardinals\n\nMurray never found his footing under former head coach Kliff Kingsbury. And now he will have to wait until 2024 to really find his footing with new play-caller Drew Petzing as well. However, Murray has the elite tools to make every throw and to create chunk plays with his legs as well.\n\nMurray, however, also leaves room to question what his thought process is between the ears with frequency as well. We will have to wait a long time to get some questions answered about Murray\u2019s deficiencies, but his tools are among the best in the league.\n\n11. Geno Smith, Seattle Seahawks\n\nThere was not a quarterback more fun to watch a year ago than Geno Smith.\n\nFinally getting the chance to start for the first time since leaving New York, Smith flew out of the gate and did not show much desire to slow up. Despite losing Wilson, the Seahawks marched back to the playoffs behind the arm of the NFL\u2019s Comeback Player of the Year.\n\nThe Seahawks put their full faith in him this offseason as well, signing him to a new deal and opting not to draft a quarterback early in the 2023 NFL draft. The question now remains: is Smith just a fun story or is he more than just a flash in the pan?\n\n10. Deshaun Watson, Cleveland Browns\n\nSticking to strictly what has happened on the field for Deshaun Watson, a six-game sample size in an offensive system he has never played in before is not enough to remove a once top-five quarterback (who is still just 27 years old!) from the top-10. It is unreasonable to expect a play-caller to flip his entire offense on his head 12 weeks into the season, but now Stefanski and Watson have a full offseason.\n\nWhile he is still listed as a top-10 quarterback here, there are no excuses for Stefanski and Watson to come out firing in 2023.\n\n9. Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles\n\nI\u2019ll probably catch heat for having Hurts so low. Good for him for leading his team to a Super Bowl and great for him for getting paid. But there is no doubt the architecture of Shane Steichen\u2019s offense played a massive role in Hurts\u2019 success. Can he thrive outside of such a schemed system? If he was not in Philadelphia would he see the same type of success?\n\n8. Dak Prescott, Dallas Cowboys\n\nUnderrated year after year, Dak Prescott remains one of the smartest quarterbacks in the league who has no problem seeing and spraying the full field. Prescott\u2019s issues over the last two seasons, however, has been staying on the field. There are reasons to question the direction the Cowboys are going under Mike McCarthy and Brian Schottenheimer, and this could limit the production of Prescott, but he is the best quarterback in the NFC right now.\n\n7. Aaron Rodgers, New York Jets\n\nHe\u2019s a walking meme off the field right now, but Rodgers and 4,000 yards passing have been a safe bet to make for the most part over the last decade. Now suiting up for the New York Jets with the skill players to continue to light up the stat sheet, it is on Rodgers to prove he is still an elite quarterback after a down year (which was still quite good).", "tiktoken_token_count": 797, "llama_token_count": 948}, {"source_name": "Fangraphs.com", "author": "Dan Szymborski", "title": "The 2024 ZiPS Projection Gainers: Hitters", "description": "Dan and ZiPS look at the hitters with the largest positive changes in their 2024 projections this year.", "url": "https://blogs.fangraphs.com/the-2024-zips-projection-gainers-hitters/", "text": "The full midseason run of the ZiPS projections have been completed, and while the standings updates are always a lot of fun, they tend to move in a similar direction to our FanGraphs standings, so they\u2019re usually not the most shocking. What I find the most interesting are the player projections, and not even the numbers for the rest of the season \u2014 the in-season model is simpler, but improvements in the full model are naturally going to be incremental \u2014 but the ones that look toward 2024 and beyond.\n\nFor today, we\u2019ll start with the hitters with the largest increases in projected 2024 WAR since my original projections and dig a little into what changed for each player. Sometimes it\u2019s performance, sometimes it\u2019s health, sometimes it\u2019s a change in position. Let\u2019s jump straight into the names, since I assume everyone reading this knows that ZiPS isn\u2019t a cheeseburger or a hoodie.\n\n1. Matt McLain, Cincinnati Reds\n\n2024 WAR: 1.8 preseason, 3.7 midseason (+1.94)\n\n2024 wOBA: .323 preseason, .350 midseason (+.027)\n\nMcLain was one of the biggest positive outlier picks in the ZiPS Top 100 Prospects, ranking 31st, easily the highest of any source I\u2019ve found. It\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t have credentials, as a two-time first-rounder coming off an .800 OPS in his first full professional season. McLain quickly made ZiPS look good by cranking up the turbo early in 2023, hitting 12 homers in six weeks for Triple-A Louisville and earning a quick promotion. Hitting .299/.364/.505 with no burning questions about his viability at shortstop, he\u2019s looking nearly as promising early on as another young middle infielder that ZiPS went out on a limb for a decade ago: the 26th-ranked Mookie Betts. (Though don\u2019t call him the next Mookie quite yet!)\n\n2. Elly De La Cruz, Cincinnati Reds\n\n2024 WAR: 1.0 preseason, 2.8 midseason (+1.79)\n\n2024 wOBA: .310 preseason, .340 midseason (+.030)\n\nMcLain may have the edge in the Rookie of the Year voting, but De La Cruz has caught the imagination of the public in a way that his less-flashy teammate hasn\u2019t. He\u2019s certainly raised Ell at the plate, slugging nearly .500 in the majors, and his wonderful baserunning aggression shows a real feel for the game and a situational awareness that is rare among even baseball\u2019s speediest. But he\u2019s still not quite as polished as McLain, and there are still some skills to be honed: he can be a little too aggressive at the plate at times, his contact rates could use a bit of a bump, and there are still questions as to what position he\u2019ll end up at long-term. Regardless, De La Cruz is one of the most fun players to watch right now; the Reds knew what they were doing when they gave him Eric Davis\u2019 number 44.\n\n3. Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr., Atlanta Braves\n\n2024 WAR: 4.5 preseason, 6.0 midseason (+1.50)\n\n2024 wOBA: .373 preseason, .393 midseason (+.019)\n\nWould Acu\u00f1a Jr.\u2019s torn ACL change his trajectory in a negative way? That was the big question for him coming into the 2023 season after a return campaign that most players would love but that was decidedly inferior to his best performances. Now we can say: no. Acu\u00f1a has been on a tear this year, and if the season ended today, he\u2019d almost certainly be the NL MVP winner. A 40\u201340 season is in play, and while he\u2019s probably off the homer pace this year too much, I don\u2019t think a 50\u201350 run is completely implausible sometime over the next couple years.\n\n4. Zach Neto, Los Angeles Angels\n\n2024 WAR: 0.1 preseason, 1.6 midseason (+1.45)\n\n2024 wOBA: .294 preseason, .327 midseason (+.033)\n\nZiPS was skeptical about Neto entering the season, but not because of anything necessarily being wrong with him; it stemmed from the simple fact that he had just over a month of professional baseball under his belt. While he was solid in Double-A, which he practically went to straight out of college, it just wasn\u2019t a lot to go on. It took all of a week of him torturing Triple-A pitchers before the Angels tried to catch lightning in a bottle, and while his performance hasn\u2019t been phenom-level, he\u2019s more than held his own against MLB pitching. ZiPS has seen enough that it\u2019s comfortable thinking of him as a league-average talent in the majors; if this continues, that projection will likely rise quite a bit more before the 2024 season.\n\n5. Wander Franco, Tampa Bay Rays\n\n2024 WAR: 3.4 preseason, 4.8 midseason (+1.39)\n\n2024 wOBA: .342 preseason, .338 midseason (-.004)\n\nI\u2019d hardly call ZiPS a Franco skeptic given that it\u2019s regularly projected him in the top 10 for rest-of-career WAR. The problem has been health, with a professional high in games played coming into the season of just 110. Playing time and health are useful predictors for future playing time and health, and with Franco healthy this year, ZiPS is a lot more confident that it can project him for a full season. Amusingly, his projected wOBA has actually dropped slightly \u2014 his zStats are a little more negative than his xStats \u2014 but by an insignificant margin that\u2019s notable only because of that negative sign in front of it.\n\n6. Masyn Winn, St. Louis Cardinals\n\n2024 WAR: 0.2 preseason, 1.5 midseason (+1.35)\n\n2024 wOBA: .271 preseason, .282 midseason (+.011)\n\nComing into the season, ZiPS saw Winn like Jordan Walker: more as a long-term play than a player who would pay immediate dividends. The defensive projection at the time was rather meh given Winn\u2019s reputation, but this year, ZiPS has him as +8 runs in a half-season at Triple-A, so there\u2019s an instant boost there in the projections. The fact that he\u2019s been able to keep doing what he did offensively at Triple-A this year, at an extremely young age, provides a significant wOBA boost in the projections as well. He just missed the ZiPS Top 100 this year, but he\u2019ll make it next year unless the Cardinals call him up quickly (or trade him to a team that does).\n\n7. Josh Jung, Texas Rangers\n\n2024 WAR: 1.3 preseason, 2.6 midseason (+1.34)\n\n2024 wOBA: .324 preseason, .337 midseason (+.013)\n\nAs with Franco, Jung being healthy \u2014 in this case after missing half a season with a torn labrum \u2014 results in a significant increase in the projection. In some ways, this is more a restoration of his pre-2022 projection: .263/.322/.444 for 2.2 WAR in 110 projected games at the time. ZiPS is now fully buying the increased power, and Jung finishing the season with 150 games played would push his 2024 projected WAR over three wins.\n\n8. Jake Scheiner, Seattle Mariners\n\n2024 WAR: -0.3 preseason, 1.1 midseason (+1.31)\n\n2024 wOBA: .290 preseason, .304 midseason (+.014)\n\nScheiner is the only player on this list that probably qualifies as a Ken Phelps All-Star, the old Bill James term for veteran players in the high minors that were overlooked. There were a lot more of them in the 1980s, when James coined the phrase; teams are a lot better now at giving talent every opportunity to succeed, and Japan and Korea are more viable places for players who fall through the cracks.\n\nScheiner isn\u2019t literally going to be Ken Phelps, but after belatedly getting promoted to Triple-A Tacoma, he\u2019s finally enjoying his first really fascinating offensive season in the minors. Sure, it\u2019s the Pacific Coast League, but Tacoma\u2019s Cheney Stadium has long been one of the biggest pitchers\u2019 parks in a notoriously offense-heavy environment. ZiPS doesn\u2019t think Scheiner is actually good yet, but he\u2019s done enough that he has his uses as a role player in the majors; if I\u2019m a team trading with the Mariners this summer, I wouldn\u2019t mind him as an interesting throw-in.\n\n9. Corbin Carroll, Arizona Diamondbacks\n\n2024 WAR: 3.9 preseason, 5.1 midseason (+1.28)\n\n2024 wOBA: .334 preseason, .360 midseason (+.026)\n\nZiPS was all-in on Carroll going into the season, projecting him as the NL Rookie of the Year, its top prospect over Gunnar Henderson, and with a WAR total edging out established outfielders such as Cedric Mullins and Bryan Reynolds. That Carroll has one of the most improved projections for next year despite all this love is testament to how monster a season he\u2019s having. There are nearly two weeks of July to go, and he\u2019s almost caught up to his yearly projection already! He\u2019s a superstar, and the Diamondbacks were right to lock him up at the first opportunity.\n\n10. Colt Keith, Detroit Tigers\n\n2024 WAR: 0.0 preseason, 1.3 midseason (+1.26)\n\n2024 wOBA: .283 preseason, .315 midseason (+.032)\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call ZiPS excited about Keith given its concerns about his defense (about five runs per season below-average at third), but it\u2019s increasingly interested in his bat thanks to his .977 OPS with Double-A Erie. He\u2019s since been promoted to the Toledo Mud Hens, and given Detroit\u2019s offensive woes, it he continues to hit at this level, he\u2019ll have the Old English D on his cap fairly quickly.", "tiktoken_token_count": 2115, "llama_token_count": 2680}, {"source_name": "ESPN", "author": null, "title": "Avs acquire Colton from Lightning for draft pick", "description": "The Avalanche acquired forward Ross Colton from the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for a second-round pick (37th overall) on Wednesday.", "url": "https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/37928301/avalanche-acquire-ross-colton-lightning-draft-pick", "text": "The Colorado Avalanche acquired forward Ross Colton from the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for a second-round pick in Wednesday night's draft.\n\nThe Lightning receive the 37th overall pick, part of the package that Colorado acquired in Tuesday's trade that sent forward Alex Newhook to the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nColton, 26, tallied 32 points (16 goals, 16 assists) in 81 games with Tampa Bay in 2022-23.

He was the Avalanche's first-round draft pick (fourth overall) in 2019 and has produced 15 goals and 43 points in 91 NHL games to date. The 22-year-old was limited to just 43 games last year as he dealt with injury issues.\n\nThe Avalanche know Byram and the team's other young core players will be an important part of the club returning to Stanley Cup champion form.

Injuries have often interrupted his efficiency, but when healthy, Wood can be a difference-maker up front.\n\nHis speed will always allow him to get in front of the net off the rush and create havoc. And he even saw some power-play time last season, adding two goals with the man-advantage, as the Devils secured a playoff berth for the first time since 2018.\n\nWood was born in Buffalo, New York, where his father, Randy, scored 60 goals in three seasons playing for the Sabres. He played last season on a one-year, $3.2 million contract.\n\nMeanwhile, Drouin will be looking for a fresh start with the Avalanche, and he'll have a familiar face nearby to do it with, reuniting with former junior hockey teammate Nathan MacKinnon.\n\nThe 28-year-old Drouin has not lived up to his lofty status as a No. 3 overall choice by the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2013, and he finished last season with two goals and 29 points for a Montreal Canadiens team that was playing out the string.\n\nSeemingly caught up in a numbers game, and tangled in between several coaching changes in Montreal, Drouin struggled to find a fit in his first six seasons with the Canadiens, who acquired him in a headline-worthy deal in 2017. The Lightning received prospect Mikhail Sergachev, who developed into a defensive anchor for Tampa Bay's title teams, in exchange for Drouin.\n\nThe 6-foot left wing scored 18 goals in 2018-19 for Montreal, but failed to reach double digits the next four seasons. His career high -- 21 tallies -- came with Tampa Bay in 2016-17. But goal-scoring potential is at a premium among wingers this free-agent season, and though Drouin has many critics around the league, he figured to attract interest as a second- or third-line option for teams looking for value up front.\n\nOne thing he won't bring with him to his new team, is winning pedigree. Drouin missed Tampa Bay's championship runs, and though the Canadiens landed in the Stanley Cup Final in 2021, he hasn't made the playoffs since, and is a career minus-86 player.", "tiktoken_token_count": 769, "llama_token_count": 930}, {"source_name": "ESPN", "author": null, "title": "Source: Predators, O'Reilly agree to 4-year deal", "description": "Ryan O'Reilly has agreed to a four-year deal with the Nashville Predators, a source told ESPN's Greg Wyshynski on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/37944651/source-predators-ryan-oreilly-agree-4-year-deal", "text": "Center Ryan O'Reilly signed a four-year deal with the Nashville Predators as NHL free agency opened Saturday.\n\nO'Reilly, 32, will make $4.5 million against the salary cap on a four-year term.

Vegas advanced to that stage in the organization's inaugural 2017-18 campaign too (it lost to the Washington Capitals), further proof that while Vegas may have joined the NHL about 100 years into its existence, these Golden Knights wasted no time making their mark.\n\nDespite Vegas' short history, the club has undergone a number of roster and coaching changes in a short half-decade that culminated in it hoisting Lord Stanley's chalice. Only six of the Golden Knights' original \"Misfits\" -- aka the first round of players selected in the 2017 expansion draft -- remained when Vegas clinched its victory: Jonathan Marchessault, William Karlsson, Reilly Smith, Brayden McNabb, Shea Theodore and William Carrier. The club hasn't stopped evolving since its inception.\n\nHow did the Golden Knights do it? What had to go wrong before so Vegas could finally get it right? And with one title under its belt, will Vegas go on to repeat with another Cup victory next summer?\n\nWe're looking back at Vegas' run to this most recent Cup Final (and its eventual victory) to break down why the Golden Knights will -- and why they won't -- be able to do it all again in 2023-24.\n\nIt'll be a fascinating journey to watch. One thing's for sure, though. With Vegas, we know there won't be a dull moment ahead.\n\nplay 1:00 Vegas hoists the Stanley Cup for the first time The Vegas Golden Knights celebrate at the Stanley Cup presentation ceremony.\n\nThe Golden Knights didn't wander into last season as obvious Cup contenders.\n\nVegas missed the playoffs entirely in 2021-22 through repeated, self-inflicted wounds. Their big in-season trade acquisition, Jack Eichel, struggled coming off neck surgery, and by April the tenor of the team was obvious disappointment and frustration over unfulfilled expectations.\n\nThat led to then-head coach Peter DeBoer being fired. Bruce Cassidy -- just let go by the Boston Bruins -- stepped in behind the bench. Then word came out in August that the club's starting netminder, Robin Lehner, was likely done for the season following hip surgery.\n\nIt felt as though Vegas was at a turning point -- but in which direction? The Golden Knights didn't need long to answer.\n\nVegas opened October 2022 with an 8-2-0 record to cement itself as one of the Western Conference's top contenders. And the Golden Knights never let up from there. They finished atop the Western standings with 111 points (51-22-9) and walked right into the postseason off a near-perfect 5-0-2 roll through April.\n\nEichel -- fully healthy and back in form -- led the Golden Knights with 27 goals and 66 points through 67 regular-season contents. But Vegas did damage by committee: Seven skaters had 15 or more goals, six surpassed the 60-point plateau and the Golden Knights paced the NHL in blocked shots per 60 minute (17.94), illustrating a ready appetite for bodily sacrifice.\n\nAlthough Mark Stone had a hat trick in the Knights' Cup-winning game, Vegas' depth of scoring was a significant strength for the club. Stephen R. Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sports\n\nVegas was deservedly confident heading into the playoffs, and it immediately showed the resiliency required of a Cup champion. The Golden Knights lost Game 1 of their first-round playoff series against the Winnipeg Jets by a 5-1 margin, then bounced back with four straight victories to ground the Jets and advance to the second round.\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers awaited there, and Vegas split the first two contests. In Game 3, the Golden Knights lost starting goaltender Laurent Brossoit to a playoff-ending groin injury. Vegas turned then to backup Adin Hill, relying on the 27-year-old to backstop the team from there. Hill delivered, and Vegas sent the Oilers packing with a 4-2 series win.\n\nIn the Western Conference finals, Vegas faced off against DeBoer and the Dallas Stars. The first two games were overtime wins for the Golden Knights, but the Stars didn't go quietly, pushing the series to an eventual sixth game that Vegas won 6-0 to reach the Cup Final against Florida.\n\nThe Panthers' path to that point was more fraught than that of the Golden Knights: Florida had played 16 games by then (including nine rounds of overtime) compared to just 12 games (and five overtimes) for Vegas. The Golden Knights took an early 2-0 lead in the series, and while the Panthers responded with a Game 3 win, it was Vegas punching back with consecutive victories to win the Cup on home ice by a 9-3 result.\n\nVegas' season came together through a confluence of factors rooted in a hundred decisions made over the previous six seasons. Cassidy proved to be a perfect fit in the Golden Knights' organization by quickly and effectively establishing an identity for the club. The team as a whole managed to stay relatively healthy in the postseason, and its depth was off the charts (four players hit double-digit goal totals in the postseason; six had 15 or more points).\n\nSo what are the chances the Golden Knights can run it back with another title this season? Caesars Sportsbook has given Vegas the second-best odds (behind the Colorado Avalanche) to be the 2023-24 Stanley Cup champion. With the NHL draft and the bulk of free agency behind us, now's the time to take a snapshot of those repeat title chances.\n\nPoint: The Golden Knights' core remains intact\n\nGeneral manager Kelly McCrimmon and president of hockey operations George McPhee took great pains piecing Vegas together into the team we see now. It'll look quite similar come fall, with those key players from the regular season and postseason returning to the fold.\n\nEichel (six goals, 26 points in the playoffs), Mark Stone (11 goals, 24 points), Chandler Stephenson (10 goals, 20 points), Marchessault (13 goals, 25 points) and Karlsson (11 goals, 17 points) remain. So do Theodore, McNabb, Alex Pietrangelo and Alec Martinez on defense. Each has become a cornerstone of Vegas' success to date. Those players set a tone.\n\nHill will return too, after his star turn as Vegas' No. 1 goaltender in the playoffs. He was sensational, posting an 11-4-0 record with a .932 save percentage and 2.17 goals-against average. In the Cup Final itself, Hill was 4-1 with a .923 SV%. Vegas smartly resigned Hill via a two-year, $9.8 million contract in June; he'll enter the Golden Knights' training camp on an inside track to be their starter once again.\n\nVegas' chemistry was palpable all season long. It was clear how much the Golden Knights enjoyed playing together, and that intangible can't be underestimated when a grinding 82-game campaign bleeds into an increasingly stressful postseason push. No new friends needed.\n\nCounterpoint: Health could be an issue\n\nColorado learned the hard way.\n\nAfter the Avalanche went on their own Cup-winning run in 2021-22, they too hoped to be poised for a repeat. The injury gods had other plans.\n\nIn the offseason following the Cup victory, captain Gabriel Landeskog underwent knee surgery and wound up missing the entire 2022-23 season. Cale Makar, Artturi Lehkonen and Nathan MacKinnon -- all integral players on that Cup team -- were sidelined by various ailments. The Avalanche didn't have enough depth to keep up -- they'd lost Nazem Kadri and Andre Burakovsky, among others, to free agency the previous summer -- and Colorado fell short of its consecutive Cup goal.\n\nThe Golden Knights will aim to avoid a similar fate. But there's a red flag or two worth watching out for, particularly with impact skaters who've been through the injury roller coaster already.\n\nStone himself has had two back surgeries in the past nine months. Eichel has never played a full 82-game season in his eight-year career. Goaltender Logan Thompson missed most of the second half of last season with a lower-body problem. And who knows what other procedures or issues players have been dealing with that we don't know about.\n\nIt takes a good deal out of everyone on the path to a Cup victory. How Vegas survives the wear and tear of a long spring -- and short summer -- will have a direct effect on its prospects this year, too.\n\nThough Jack Eichel remained healthy through the postseason, he has yet to play a full 82-game season in his career. Lucas Peltier-USA TODAY Sports\n\nPoint: Vegas' ownership and management group want to win -- at any cost\n\nGolden Knights owner Bill Foley strives to be a man of his word.\n\nHe's off to a good start.\n\nFoley recounted for reporters last month how, when Karlsson agreed to an eight-year extension with Vegas in June 2019, he expected \"three Stanley Cups\" during the length of the contract.\n\n\"When we were on the ice [after the Cup victory] and getting our pictures taken,\" Foley said, \"I looked over at [Karlsson] and told him, 'OK, you got one.'\"\n\nVegas has four years -- on Foley's timeline anyway -- to grab two more. And there's no doubt Foley will give his executives every green light available to try and get there. McPhee and McCrimmon have a history of showing they'll take advantage of opportunity.\n\nMcCrimmon has said repeatedly that while Vegas' run to the Cup Final in its inaugural season wasn't a fluke, the organization had to improve season over season to be where it's at now, positioned as a perennial contender.\n\nTo make that a reality, the Golden Knights aren't afraid to make hard -- or unpopular -- decisions. Last month Vegas traded Smith, an original Golden Knight, to Pittsburgh to free up enough cap space to sign Ivan Barbashev to a five-year, $25 million extension. Vegas previously acquired Barbashev from St. Louis at the trade deadline, and he was a force in the postseason, putting up seven goals and 18 points (Smith, by comparison, tallied four goals and 14 points).\n\nMcCrimmon & Co. don't get bogged down by emotion. Smith was the first player to whom Stone handed the Cup after his initial captain's lap, but moving him freed up cap space and got Vegas a third-round draft pick in return.\n\nCounterpoint: Cap space could be an issue\n\nAt the moment, Vegas has $1,423,317 in cap space, according to Cap Friendly.\n\nNow, that could change if and when the team shifts players to long-term injured reserve down the road (for example, Lehner spent all of this past year on LTIR with a hip issue, and his $5 million hit might end up there again depending on his current health status).\n\nLike some other teams, the Golden Knights have gotten creative in the recent past in hurdling over any cap-related restraints. If there's a loophole they can use to sign or keep a player, they will explore it in earnest.\n\nHowever, the cap is what it is -- and it's increasing by a paltry $1 million this season (to hit $83.5 million). Should the Golden Knights not be able to capitalize on LTIR space like they have in the past, it could tie their hands when it comes to making in-season improvements. Having the team's core dialed in is the ideal scenario, but as the Avalanche discovered, there must be room to adjust on the fly as well -- or else.\n\nRobin Lehner hasn't played in a game since April 20, 2022. Getty Images\n\nReality: It's hard -- but not impossible -- to repeat\n\nJust 16 NHL teams have won consecutive championships. Only Tampa Bay (in 2020 and 2021) and Pittsburgh (2016 and 2017) have managed to do it in the past 25 years.\n\nThere's a long list of reasons for why that feat is so difficult. Fatigue plays a major role for many Cup-winning teams the following season. The league's other 31 teams have had the chance to improve themselves over the past months and weeks, too. There's a target on the back of champions. That can creep into any player's head space and take hold -- positively or negatively.\n\nThe mere pressure of attempting to repeat can derail that very attempt. It's a collection of issues every former victor has had to navigate, and the vast majority fall short.\n\nThat's not to say Vegas can't be the exception. All things being equal, the Golden Knights should have a strong, motivated team going into the season. And Vegas has enjoyed defying the odds, whether in that first-season push to the Cup Final or by their willingness to take risks that ultimately paid off.\n\nWhat's the final verdict, then, on Vegas' potential going 2-for-2? It's easy to be high on its chances in July. On paper, the Golden Knights are obvious contenders you'd be hard-pressed to bet against.\n\nBut as every card player knows too well -- tables can go from hot to cold in a blink.

I know in Edmonton, we were one of the first teams to use the Pride tape,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cI know in Edmonton, in our dressing room, we strongly feel that hockey is for everybody. That includes the Pride nights and stuff like that.\n\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s disappointing to see. With that being said, it\u2019s certainly way, way above my decision.

It could have been a non-issue while focusing on the good that was coming out of those nights,\u201d he added.\n\nNHL Pride Nights became a hot topic of conversation earlier this year when Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Ivan Provorov refused to participate in his team\u2019s Pride Night due to his orthodox Christian faith, sparking outrage from leftists who proceeded to accuse him of bigotry and homophobia. However, the Philadelphia Flyers kept him in the lineup, and the team even went on to win the game against the Anaheim Ducks.\n\n\u201cI respect everybody, and I respect everybody\u2019s choices,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cMy choice is to stay true to myself and my religion. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201d\n\nLater, the San Jose Sharks goaltender James Reimer chose not to wear a pride-themed warm-up jersey in a recent game, citing his Christian faith.\n\n\u201cFor all 13 years of my NHL career, I have been a Christian \u2014 not just in title, but in how I choose to live my life daily. I have a personal faith in Jesus Christ who died on the cross for my sins and, in response, asks me to love everyone and follow him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have no hate in my heart for anyone, and I have always strived to treat everyone that I encounter with respect and kindness. In this specific instance, I am choosing not to endorse something that is counter to my personal convictions which are based on the Bible, the highest authority in my life,\u201d he added.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported last week, the NHL Board of Governors agreed with Commissioner Gary Bettman that the numerous refusals from certain teammates to wear Pride jerseys were a distraction.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just become more of a distraction from really the essence of what the purpose of these nights are,\u201d Bettman said. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping the focus on the game.

Instead, the 27-year-old Russian power forward will count $5 million against the salary cap through 2028.\n\nThat was exactly Smith\u2019s cap hit, making this another set of bold moves by Vegas general manager Kelly McCrimmon, who has shown a willingness to take risks in the name of getting younger and winning championships \u2014 and not worrying about sentimentality.\n\nSmith, 32, was one of six original Vegas players left from the team\u2019s inaugural season that included a trip to the final. He was the first player captain Mark Stone handed the Cup after the Golden Knights won it earlier this month.\n\nVegas recouped the third-round pick it sent to Pittsburgh for forward Teddy Blueger prior to the trade deadline.\n\nThe deal is the first big roster splash for new Penguins president of hockey operations Kyle Dubas, who is tasked with getting the team back into the playoffs and continuing to contend with Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, and Kris Letang still around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAvalanche acquire Colton\n\nThe Avalanche acquired forward Ross Colton in a trade with the Lightning.

In April of Mitchell\u2019s freshman year, three of his friends from home, all members of the Humboldt Broncos junior hockey team, were among 16 on the team bus to die following a horrific highway accident in Saskatchewan.\n\nOnly 19 at the time, Mitchell lost his closest pal, right wing Logan Hunter, along with left wing Conner Lukan and goalie Parker Tobin.\n\n\u201cAll of us from Alberta . . . and all grew up kind of playing together,\u201d Mitchell recalled recently. \u201cJust a terrible event.\u201d\n\nIn order to help Mitchell deal with his grief, Montgomery and his wife, Emily, welcomed him into their home. It served to underscore Mitchell\u2019s belief that Montgomery cared as much about his players as people as he did their being part of the team.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRight after the crash happened, he invited me over to his house to stay there for a few days, just to get me out of the dorms and be around family,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget what that scene was like, and what he did for me in a very difficult time in my life. Off the ice . . . his support of me has been immeasurable.\u201d\n\nMontgomery, the NHL\u2019s coach of the year for 2022-23, was aware that the front office had Mitchell on their radar in the days leading up to the Hall trade.\n\n\u201cI gave [general manager Don Sweeney] my thoughts,\u201d said Montgomery. \u201cI told him, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019d like to work with [Mitchell] again.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMontgomery\u2019s thumbnail profile of Mitchell: \u201cA high-character person, high hockey sense, high compete, and a real good skater . . . he\u2019s going to fit in well with the Bruins culture. A smart, skilled defenseman who moves the puck really well. It might take him a while. I don\u2019t know how long before he gets to Boston, but he\u2019s going to be a good one for us.\u201d\n\nDrafted 57th overall in 2017, Mitchell played three seasons with the Pioneers before turning pro in the spring of 2020. He spent most of his first pro season on the varsity blue line, played sparingly his second season, then was back in Chicago full time last season, though was hindered by a wrist injury for the first two months. Coached by Luke Richardson, Mitchell spent most of his time at five-on-five and helped on the power play.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen training camp opens in Brighton on Sept. 20, Mitchell will be vying for time on the No. 3 defense pairing, which currently projects to have Derek Forbort on the left and veteran free agent pickup Kevin Shattenkirk on the right. Others in the mix include Jakub Zboril, Alec Regula (obtained in the same trade as Mitchell) and possibly ex-Harvard standout Reilly Walsh (acquired from New Jersey). No shortage of candidates.\n\nMitchell, 5 foot 11 inches and 193 pounds, figures his skating and puck-moving skills are his calling card. He trains summers in Denver, joined there by Bruin Brandon Carlo and other NHLers, including Denver alums Troy Terry, Scott Mayfield, and Will Butcher. He plans to pack up at the start of September for the move to Boston.\n\n\u201cEveryone tells me I\u2019m going to love it,\u201d Mitchell said, his prior visits here only brief. \u201cI\u2019m excited to get going.\u201d\n\nWAITING TO BE HEARD\n\nSwayman, Frederic slated for arbitration\n\nJeremy Swayman and the Bruins look headed for arbitration. Barry Chin/Globe Staff\n\nUnless there\u2019s a negotiated meeting of the minds in the next few days, Jeremy Swayman and the Bruins will enter the salary arbitration meat grinder July 29, followed by Trent Frederic\u2019s hearing Aug. 1.\n\nGM Don Sweeney, with some $5.4 million remaining in cap space, will have to rearrange the roster slightly if both players go through the process and are awarded paydays in excess of that number. Given the historical landscape across the league, odds favor a negotiated settlement in the hours leading up to both hearings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, the Jets and Gabriel Vilardi, one of the key assets acquired in the Pierre-Luc Dubois trade with the Kings, avoided their hearing and settled on a two-year deal at $3.44 million annually, a four-fold bump for Vilardi, 23, who wrangled a meager $825,000 out of the Kings for last season after terming out of his entry-level contract.\n\nThe Golden Knights and arbitration-bound Brett Howden also settled Wednesday, negotiating a two-year pact that carries a $1.9 million cap hit. Vegas still has some slimming down to do, Howden\u2019s deal leaving the team $4.15 million over the cap, even after moving Reilly Smith\u2019s $5 million off the books last month for a Penguins third-round draft pick in 2024.\n\nMaple Leafs goalie Ilya Samsonov, with slightly more experience than Swayman (131 games vs. 88), entered arbitration Friday in search of $4.9 million, slightly more than double the $2.4 million the Leafs offered.\n\nA comparable spread for Swayman would be, say, $2 million-$4 million, the middle ground of which would be ideal from the Bruins\u2019 perspective. It would set them up for the coming season with Swayman and partner Linus Ullmark, the returning Vezina winner, making a combined $8 million \u2014 slightly less than 10 percent of the cap ceiling ($83.5 million) to cover the most important position.\n\nFrederic, with 198 games and 54 points, has termed out of his second contract after making $1.15 million last season. There is no all-things-being-equal equation in all of this, but something approaching Howden\u2019s $1.9 million would seem a decent payday for Frederic, who was chosen two picks after Howden in the first round of the 2016 draft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowden, a Tampa Bay draft pick, has delivered .294 points per game at the NHL level, while Frederic has popped for .273.\n\nETC.\n\nCanadiens\u2019 pick not a welcome surprise\n\nThe Canadiens selection of David Reinbacher wasn't a popular one with the fans. Bruce Bennett/Getty\n\nThey\u2019re restless in Montreal. That\u2019s not news, not after what is now a 30-year Cup drought for the Canadiens. Remember, Les Glorieux won it five times in their first 30 years, and rattled off a record five straight (1956-60) in what Habs fans considered normal times.\n\nThe reaction of the fan base was exceptionally nasty after last month\u2019s decision by Jeff Gorton, Kent Hughes, et al, to use the fifth pick in the draft on David Reinbacher, a 6-foot-2-inch Austrian-born defenseman out of Switzerland\u2019s top pro league. Let it not be overlooked that the kid literally has CH in his name.\n\nThe reaction: David who?!\n\nActually, it was more emotional than that, but we\u2019re going by old-school Sunday newspaper rules. Habs fans had their minds set on the far more hyped Matvei Michkov, the Russian right winger who some believe could be the next Kirill Kaprizov (a fifth-round choice in 2015 by the Wild).\n\nMichkov, who might not be able to break his contract in Russia for at least two more years, went No. 7 to the Flyers.\n\nReinbacher, with the size (6-2/185) and game that encouraged the Bruins to select Charlie McAvoy at No. 14 in 2016, got lambasted by Habs fans on social media, in part because he\u2019s unknown, in part because he\u2019s not Michkov, in part because of the aforementioned 30-year drought.\n\nEvery draft, unless it\u2019s Connor McDavid at No. 1 to Edmonton in 2015 or even Connor Bedard at No. 1 to Chicago this year, places fans in a position of faith \u2014 the trust that a club\u2019s infrastructure of talent assessment knows what it\u2019s doing.\n\nFaith and trust are low in Montreal, albeit only a year removed from the Canadiens delighting most everyone up there by using the No. 1 pick to select Juraj Slafkovsk\u00fd, the highly touted Slovak left wing. As a rookie, Slafkovsk\u00fd proved that like most 18-year-olds, he\u2019ll need time for his game to grow into its promise. He finished a modest 4-6\u201310 in 39 games, his season coming to an end in mid-January because of a lower-body injury.\n\nNick Bobrov, the former Bruins scout who is now co-director of amateur scouting for the Canadiens, reminded one and all in Nashville that it\u2019s \u201cnot a trivial matter\u201d that the Canadiens are trying to create and build a team culture \u2014 one they feel Reinbacher fits.\n\n\u201cWe all watch the playoffs,\u201d Bobrov added, \u201cand for two months of the year we get reminded of what works and what wins [and] maybe we tend to forget that for 10 months.\u201d\n\nUnlike McAvoy, Reinbacher\u2019s draft profile was low, to the point of being barely existent last summer. But it began to lift during his performance in the World Junior Championships last summer in Edmonton and throughout his second season playing for Kloten in the Swiss League. All things considered, the Canadiens felt Reinbacher was the best defenseman available.\n\nTry not to \u201cget caught up in shiny objects, I guess,\u201d Bobrov recently told The Athletic, explaining the Canadiens\u2019 decision-making process.\n\nPrior to heading home for the summer, Reinbacher signed his entry-level contract, worth $6.35 million if he\u2019s on Montreal\u2019s roster for three full seasons. Like Leo Carlsson, the Swedish center who recently signed after being selected No. 2 by Anaheim, Reinbacher could play in North America for the coming season or remain in Europe.\n\nFree agency not a big boon\n\nTyler Bertuzzi didn't find the free agent market he expected. Michael Dwyer/Associated Press\n\nForwards Tomas Nosek and Tyler Bertuzzi played much different roles in the Bruins\u2019 offense, and now both have moved on to new clubs for prices that have left some Black-and-Gold fans scratching their heads.\n\nNo need to scratch: In both cases, market forces in free agency played out much differently than either player expected.\n\nPrior to prices sagging, especially at the top end of the market where Bertuzzi rightfully was shopping, Don Sweeney was in a position of having to secure bona fide NHL talent for the Bruins amid the annual mad merry-go-round July 1.\n\nWe can argue over what the likes of oldsters James van Riemsdyk, Milan Lucic, and Kevin Shattenkirk will offer. But while Bertuzzi and Nosek were shopping with deep pockets wide open, Sweeney opted to fill roster spots with guys willing to take huge late-career financial haircuts. Otherwise, he risked having to fill the lineup with kids who could have proven not quite ready for prime time.\n\nImagine the head scratching among the fan base if the record at the Christmas break read something like 11-19-2? Bad in normal times, but what about after a record-setting 65-12-5 campaign?\n\nNosek, who played here the last two seasons for a $1.75 million cap hit, on Wednesday finally grabbed what he could, a one-year, $1 million deal with the Devils. In a more typical market (perhaps to return next season?), the trusty Nosek, even as a fourth-liner, reasonably could have expected a modest bump of $500K, or perhaps a total of $5 million over two years.\n\nA frustrated Bertuzzi, wise enough to spot where the market was headed, opted for a one-year deal with the Leafs July 2. Price: $5.5M, or less than a 20 percent hike over the $4.75 million cap hit he came to Boston with from Detroit \u2014 a deal he negotiated as a restricted free agent. Bertuzzi, remember, tied Brad Marchand (10) as points leader for the Bruins\u2019 all-too-brief playoff run in April.\n\nNo big secret to winning\n\nWhat was the secret sauce that led the Golden Knights to the franchise\u2019s first Stanley Cup title?\n\n\u201cAh, boy, tough question,\u2019 said their coach, Bruce Cassisdy, the former Bruins bench boss, back on Cape Cod for the summer. \u201cBecause I thought we had good Bruins teams \u2014 and I\u2019m sure they thought they had the best chance to win this year. I think it\u2019s just elevating your game at the right time.\u201d\n\nFor the Golden Knights, added Cassidy, timely goals across the lineup, along with timely saves, made the difference.\n\n\u201cWe were able to make the difference \u2014 making plays when we had to,\u201d he said. \u201cSome games I think we were just flat-out better than the other team, and other games we lost that we didn\u2019t deserve to win. But in important games, we just made the play. And it wasn\u2019t one guy \u2014 it was [Jonathan] Marchessault, Jack Eichel, [Ivan] Barbashev, [Chandler] Stephenson, [Mark] Stone, [Brett Howden], [Michael] Amadio scores in double OT. So I think you need stories like that, where everyone\u2019s pitching in.\u201d\n\nBy and large, the roster grew healthier as the postseason extended, contrary to standard playoff attrition. One exception was in net, where Adin Hill (11-4) picked up for an injured Laurent Brossoit (5-2). The Knights bucked conventional wisdom, essentially winning the Cup on the shoulders of two goalies who entered the postseason as career backups with no playoff experience.\n\n\u201cThat conversation\u2019s going to start changing here soon,\u201d predicted Cassidy. \u201cColorado won with [Darcy] Kuemper and used their other guy [Pavel Francouz] along the way, too, so maybe it\u2019s not like you need your Patrick Roy and Marty Brodeur from years ago, where they\u2019re going to carry the team. Yes, you need good goaltending, but I think general managers are looking at that and maybe you won\u2019t see the big deals for the goalies like maybe you did years ago.\u201d\n\nLoose pucks\n\nFor the 11th year running, the Bruins will dispatch their rookies to Buffalo for the Prospects Challenge, this year with Montreal, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, and New Jersey in the September mixer. The WannaB\u2019s open against the Penguins on Sept. 15, face the Canadiens on Sept. 16, then close it out Sept. 18 against the Devils. Varsity camp then opens two days later in Brighton . . . The 2003 draft that delivered Patrice Bergeron at No., 45 to the Bruins, also brought them Alaska-born Nate Thompson at No. 183. Thompson, who played last season for AHL Ontario, called it a career Thursday after 844 NHL games, four of those with the Bruins. His sweater collection also includes the Islanders, Lightning, Ducks, Senators, Kings, Canadiens, Flyers, and Jets . . . Ross Colton, ex- of the University of Vermont and the Lightning, signed a four-year extension with the Avalanche with a $4 million cap hit \u2014 big leap over the $1.125 million he made with Tampa Bay. Technically, that put the Avalanche well over the cap, but with Gabriel Landeskog ($7 million cap hit) expected hors de combat for the season, Colorado should fit comfortably under the $83.5 million threshold . . . Nosek in New Jersey will join an expanding group of former Bruins that includes Erik Haula and Curtis Lazar up front and Dougie Hamilton and Colin Miller on defense.\n\nKevin Paul Dupont can be reached at kevin.dupont@globe.com.", "tiktoken_token_count": 3583, "llama_token_count": 4305}, {"source_name": "Knowyourmeme.com", "author": "Brandon Wink", "title": "iDubbbz Confirms 'Creator Clash 2' Lost $250,000 And Did Not Donate To Charity", "description": "Creator Clash 2's founder iDubbbz is facing significant criticism after revealing that the charity boxing event in April lost a quarter-million dollars and he was unable to pay out any money to the charities as promised.", "url": "https://knowyourmeme.com/news/idubbbz-confirms-creator-clash-2-lost-250000-and-did-not-donate-to-charity", "text": "Months after the influencer boxing event Creator Clash 2 wrapped up, the competition's creator iDubbbz released another video regarding the event and him as a person, following the criticism of his handling of Froggy Fresh's contentious removal from the fight card.\n\nIn the newest video released on Monday, iDubbbz went over the financial aspect of the event and admitted that it only sold 50,000 pay-per-view tickets, claiming he lost roughly $250,000 and that he wasn't able to donate any money to the charities as he promised.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite releasing the information himself in the video, word about the charity donations falling through has quickly garnered controversy online as the video has racked up nearly half a million views in less than 48 hours.\n\nPerhaps unexpectedly for those following the events leading up to Creator Clash, the immediate speculation by some commentators on social media was that the ongoing feud between iDubbbz and Sam Hyde was directly part of the reason why the event lost money, as some see iDubbbz raising security and his comments towards Hyde as reasons for people to be turned off to the event and it losing money \u2014 though this isn't proven.\n\nThough the exact reasons for the financial struggles weren't explicitly laid out, iDubbbz explained that Creator Clash 2 had a higher cost than Creator Clash 1, which is part of the reasoning for the $250,000 loss.\n\nThe increase in cost from Creator Clash 1 to 2 is also apparent when looking at Creator Clash 2 having the pre-fight and post-fight venue taking place within a more expensive hotel, and Creator Clash 1 not having a post-fight event at all.\n\nAdditionally, the Yuengling Center (where Creator Clash 1 took place) is a 55,000 square-foot college arena that was used during its off-season vs. the 670,000 square-foot Amalie Arena (where the professional NHL team Tampa Bay Lightning play), meaning all costs across the board would almost surely be significantly higher.\n\nYesterday, iDubbbz then began a 24-hour charity stream in which he's attempting to raise over $250,000 in donations from fans to then give to the charities that weren't able to be paid out as a result of Creator Clash 2's financial issues. This stream had various incentives, which were almost fully met within the first 20 hours of the stream.\n\nOthers, however, took the opportunity to bash iDubbbz further for using a stream and other people's donations while they felt the loss of money was entirely his fault for how he handled the FroggyFresh controversy and Creator Clash 2 as a whole.", "tiktoken_token_count": 535, "llama_token_count": 678}, {"source_name": "SB Nation", "author": "Jack Milko", "title": "Steph Curry joins the \u2018Mt.

Rushmore\u2019 of two-sport athletes.\n\nPlaying Through reveals these four athletes below:\n\nMt. Rushmore of Two-Sport Athletes\n\nStephen Curry\n\nNBA: Golden State Warriors (2009-Present)\n\nGolf: 2023 American Century Championship Winner, Scratch Golfer\n\nCollege Basketball: Davidson (2006-2009)\n\nCurry is a world-class golfer, as his handicap hovers around scratch. He proved his abilities this past weekend at Lake Tahoe, as he was the star of the show at the American Century Championship.\n\nHis hole-in-one went viral. He made the winning putt on the 18th hole, echoing the game-winning buzzer beater he made in 2016 against the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nAnd on top of it all, Curry became the first active athlete to win this tournament since 2000. He also became the first African American to win this prestigious event.\n\nHe stars for the Golden State Warriors, with whom he has won four NBA titles. The former Davidson Wildcat has also drained more three-pointers than any other player in the history of the NBA.\n\nSo yes, Curry is an obvious addition to the Mt. Rushmore of two-sport athletes.\n\nJackie Robinson\n\nMLB: Brooklyn Dodgers (1947-1956)\n\nCollege Track & Field: UCLA (1939-1941)\n\nCollege Football: UCLA (1939-1941)\n\nCollege Basketball: UCLA (1939-1941)\n\nCollege Baseball: UCLA (1939-1941)\n\nJackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball and became a first-ballot Hall of Fame member in 1962.\n\nHe did so much for American sports and racial justice, which often overshadows how great of an athlete he was.\n\nRobinson is highly regarded as one of the best infielders of all time, as he used his athleticism to play superb defense for his nine years with the Dodgers.\n\nRobinson was no slouch at the plate either, as he had a career batting average of .313 and hit 141 home runs. He also batted in 761 RBIs.\n\nHis baseball accolades do not stop there.\n\nRobinson led the National League in stolen bases in 1947 and 1949 and was elected to the All-Star team on six occasions.\n\nOf course, his ability to steal so many bases stems from his incredible record on the track. He was lightning fast and would have represented the United States in the Olympics had World War II not suspended the games in 1940 and 1944.\n\nInstead, Robinson won the 1940 NCAA Championship in the long jump.\n\nHe also played running back on the UCLA football team, averaging more than 12 yards per carry during the 1940 season\u2014a record that still holds today.\n\nRobinson is one of the greatest athletes of all time, and yes, he was safe in Game 1 of the 1955 World Series.\n\nBo Jackson\n\nNFL: Los Angeles Raiders (1987-1990)\n\nMLB: Kansas City Royals (1986-1990)\n\nMLB: Chicago White Sox (1991, 1993)\n\nMLB: Los Angeles Angels (1994)\n\nCollege Football: Auburn (1982-1986)\n\nCollege Baseball: Auburn (1982-1986)\n\nBo Jackson quickly became an international superstar thanks to his athletic prowess.\n\nHe could do it all on the gridiron and the diamond.\n\nWhile at Auburn, Jackson\u2019s famous touchdown in 1982 against arch-rival Alabama made him a household name. That play is now known as \u201cBo Over the Top.\u201d\n\nIn the spring, Jackson dominated the field while also hitting .338 from the plate. He turned the heads of many scouts from the pro football ranks and the major leagues.\n\nHe turned down a contract offer from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers following the 1986 Draft. Jackson opted to go to the Kansas City Royals of the MLB instead.\n\nThen, a year later, the Raiders drafted Jackson in the seventh round of the 1987 NFL Draft, and he decided to pursue both football and baseball.\n\nHe quickly became a fan favorite.\n\nHe played four seasons for the Raiders, rushing for almost 2,800 yards and scoring 18 touchdowns as a running back.\n\nBut a hip injury in January 1991 completely derailed his athletic future.\n\nHe sustained it in a playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals and was never the same again.\n\nConsequently, Jackson retired from football but still tried to give baseball a shot.\n\nHe unfortunately did not produce great results with the White Sox and Angels\u2014unlike when he did with the Royals, as he lit up major league baseball as few had done before in Kansas City.\n\nHe finished his career with a .250 batting average, and had his best season in 1989, when he drove in 105 runs, and hit 32 homers\u2014all while playing football for the Raiders.\n\nDeion Sanders\n\nNFL: Atlanta Falcons (1989-1993)\n\nNFL: San Francisco 49ers (1994)\n\nNFL: Dallas Cowboys (1995-1999)\n\nNFL: Washington Redskins (2000)\n\nNFL: Baltimore Ravens (2004-2005)\n\nMLB: New York Yankees (1989-1990)\n\nMLB: Atlanta Braves (1991-1994)\n\nMLB: Cincinnati Reds (1994-1995; 1997; 2001)\n\nMLB: San Francisco Giants (1995)\n\nCollege Baseball: Florida State (1985-1989)\n\nCollege Football: Florida State (1985-1989)\n\nCollege Track: Florida State (1985-1989)\n\n\u201cPrimetime\u201d Deion Sanders electrified both the baseball field and the football field with his tremendous athleticism and speed.\n\nHe was never afraid to showcase his abilities either, often high-stepping into the end-zone whenever he had the chance. He loved to trash talk too.\n\nSanders played cornerback while at Florida State and in the NFL, where he later became one of the most prolific returners of all-time.\n\nHe also spent time playing some wide receiver.\n\nSome regard Sanders as the greater defensive back the game has ever seen as he was enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nHis baseball career was not as successful as his football one, but he was still a solid player nonetheless.\n\nThe best year of Sanders\u2019 career on the diamond came in 1992, when batted .304 for the Braves. He also stole 26 bases and led the National League in triples with 14.\n\nToday, Sanders is the head football coach at the University of Colorado.\n\nJack Milko is a golf staff writer for SB Nation\u2019s Playing Through.

Still, there were plenty of players that could help NHL franchises improve heading towards the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nSome of the biggest names included Tyler Bertuzzi, Ryan O'Reilly, Matt Duchene and Dmitri Orlov. With most of the top free agents having signed deals with their new teams, let's take a look at some of the biggest winners and losers of NHL free agency.\n\nIt's hard to argue that there's a team more improved than the Carolina Hurricanes. Coming off a spirited run to the Eastern Conference Final despite being undermanned, Hurricanes general manager Don Waddell had the burner cranked all the way up on the stove.\n\nCarolina improved their blue line in a big way as they signed Orlov, who was one of the top free agents on the market, to a two-year, $16 million deal after he turned in a career year in which he registered 36 points (7 goals, 29 assists) splitting time between the Boston Bruins and Washington Capitals. Orlov gives the Hurricanes a top-pairing type of a defenseman that could skate with offensive-minded Brent Burns next season.\n\nThe Hurricanes also signed former Toronto Maple Leafs winger Michael Bunting to a three-year, $13.5 million contract. Bunting has scored 46 goals over the past two seasons and gives Carolina a huge boost to their top-six forwards. In addition, the Hurricanes decided to run it back in net, as they signed veteran goaltenders Frederik Andersen and Antti Raanta to short-term deals. It may have come as a little bit of surprise with young netminder Pyotr Kochetkov waiting in the wings, but Andersen and Raanta have a veteran presence that a team chasing a Stanley Cup can utilize.\n\nLoser: Boston Bruins\n\nThe Boston Bruins are coming off the single greatest regular season in NHL history with 135 points and 65 wins to their credit. Still, the Bruins ended up being eliminated by the Florida Panthers in the opening round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs after squandering a 3-1 lead.\n\nIn the early stages of free agency, the Bruins signed veterans James van Riemsdyk, Milan Lucic and Kevin Shattenkirk, as well as former Seattle Kraken forward Morgan Geekie. These moves are fine for a contending team that already has a stacked roster in place, but the Bruins failed to bring back Tyler Bertuzzi or Orlov, who they acquired at the 2023 trade deadline.\n\nThe Bruins do have depth on the blue line, so not retaining Orlov at an $8 million annual price tag is understandable to an extent. However, letting Bertuzzi walk in free agency is a gamble. His versatility on the wing had been a terrific fit in Boston, so it was a little surprising to see them make little effort to retain his services.\n\nWinner: Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nFree agency didn't get off to the most stellar start for the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday. Just minutes into free agency, they lost veteran forward Ryan O'Reilly to the Nashville Predators. The Hurricanes also signed Bunting away from the Maple Leafs, so things were looking bleak.\n\nBut on Sunday, the Maple Leafs' fortunes changed in a big way. The team landed Bertuzzi on a one-year, $5.5 million deal -- one of the biggest prizes in free agency. The Maple Leafs also signed forward Max Domi to a one-year, $3 million contract. After losing Bunting and O'Reilly, Toronto acted swiftly in order to replace them, and did so with two of the top forwards remaining on the market.\n\nThe Maple Leafs then added defenseman John Klingberg on a one-year, $4.15 million contract. Klingberg isn't exactly a defensive stalwart, but his offensive prowess could be a welcome addition to Toronto's blue line.\n\nAfter appearing in the Stanley Cup Final in three consecutive seasons, that streak came to an end for the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Lightning fell at the hands of the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round of the postseason.\n\nMuch like the 2022 offseason, the Lightning were forced to make some tough financial decisions. Tampa Bay ended up trading forward Ross Colton to the Colorado Avalanche for draft pick compensation, as well as seeing forward Alex Killorn sign with the Anaheim Ducks. With very little financial space to spare, the Lightning signed forwards Conor Sheary and Luke Glendening to cap-friendly deals.\n\nFor the second consecutive offseason, the Lightning lost a key forward after they weren't able to re-sign Ondrej Palat in 2022. Dynasties eventually get older and just aren't able to retain everybody that made those championships possible. That is likely whar we're witnessing with the Lightning.\n\nWinner: Colorado Avalanche\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche were hampered by injuries throughout the 2022-23 season. Being a healthier team next season, combined with some solid signing in free agency, will help the Avalanche achieve that feat.\n\nGeneral manager Joe Sakic inked former New Jersey Devils winger Miles Wood to a six-year deal at just $2.5 million AAV to give the Avalanche some scoring depth. Colorado wasn't done, as the team signed Jonathan Drouin to a one-year, $825,000 deal in the hopes of reviving his career.\n\nThe Avalanche also signed defenseman Bowen Byram, who was a restricted free agent, to a two-year, $3.85 million contract extension. Byram produced a career year in which he registered 24 points (10 goals, 14 assists) in just 42 games. Prior to free agency beginning, Sakic also brought veteran center Ryan Johansen to Colorado for the rights to Alex Galchenyuk, and the Nashville Predators retained 50 percent of Johansen's salary in that deal.\n\nThe Avalanche have plenty of star power in the form of Natahn MacKinnon, Cale Makar and Mikko Rantanen, but bringing in depth pieces like Wood, Drouin, and Johansen were sound moves that championship squads make.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins had an impressive start to the offseason when they brought in Kyle Dubas as the team's new president. However, he made one very questionable move as free agency got underway over the weekend.\n\nEntering free agency, it appeared as though the Penguins were looking to make a change in net. Goaltender Tristan Jarry looked to be on his way out, but Pittsburgh ended up re-signing the veteran goalie to a five-year, $26.857 million contract. Jarry's new deal will carry a $5.375 million annual cap hit, despite him being injured often and having a 3.00 career goals-against-average in the postseason.\n\nThe Penguins also added former Devils defenseman Ryan Graves to a six-year, $27 million contract to help stabilize the blue line. It's a decent move, but that Jarry deal may end up being a huge eyesore. It would've made more sense for the Penguins to kick the tires on a potential trade for Winnipeg Jets netminder Connor Hellebuyck or Anaheim Ducks goalie John Gibson rather than settling on a known commodity.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1506, "llama_token_count": 1874}, {"source_name": "CBS Sports", "author": "Austin Nivison", "title": "NHL Draft 2023: Looking back at the star-studded 2003 draft class, 20 years later", "description": "The 2003 NHL Draft in Nashville produced more than two dozen All-Stars", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/nhl-draft-2023-looking-back-at-the-star-studded-2003-draft-class-20-years-later/", "text": "The 2023 NHL Draft in Nashville marks the 20th anniversary of the greatest draft of all-time, which was held in the very same city. The 2003 draft produced countless legends and a handful of future Hall of Famers.\n\nThe 2003 draft class started out well, with Marc-Andre Fleury and Eric Staal as the top two picks, but future NHL All-Stars were taken as late as the second-to-last pick. In total, a whopping 27 future All-Stars heard their names called 20 years ago in Nashville.\n\nKeep in mind that number doesn't even include players like Nathan Horton, Braydon Coburn, Eric Fehr, Mark Stuart, Patrick Eaves, Kevin Klein and Matt Carle. All of them had long and successful careers, but were never named to an All-Star Game.\n\nNot only did the 2003 draft class boast starpower, but it also boasted longevity, with 11 of them playing in the 2022-23 season. NHL-caliber talent littered this draft class, and it may be a long time before we see another one like it.\n\nLet's take a look back at the 27 All-Stars that the 2003 NHL Draft produced and see how their careers played out.\n\nMarc-Andre Fleury | G\n\nPick: No. 1 overall\n\nTeam: Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nAll-Star: 2011, 2015, 2018-2019\n\nThis was the last time a goalie was the No. 1 overall pick, and it worked out pretty well for the Penguins. It took a few years for Fleury to get his footing in the NHL, but he broke out in 2007-08, when he posted a .921 save percentage and 2.33 GAA in 35 games. That was the start of a long run of success for Fleury.\n\nIn the 2008-09 season, Fleury helped lead the Penguins to their first Stanley Cup since 1992, and he won two more rings in Pittsburgh before the Vegas Golden Knights selected him in the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft. The following season, Fleury was terrific for Vegas as he powered them to the Stanley Cup Final in their inaugural season. Three years later, he won the 2021 Vezina Trophy with a 1.98 GAA and a .928 save percentage.\n\nSince then, Fleury made a brief stop in Chicago, and he has one more year left on his current contract with the Minnesota Wild. That will give him the chance to build upon his impressive career numbers that include 544 wins, 73 shutouts, and a .913 save percentage.\n\nEric Staal | C\n\nPick: No. 2 overall\n\nTeam: Carolina Hurricanes\n\nAll-Star: 2007-2009, 2011, 2018, 2020\n\nAs a rookie in 2003-04, Staal tallied a modest 11 goals and 20 assists. That's a solid - but not spectacular - rookie campaign. Staal took his game to an elite level in his second year with the Hurricanes.\n\nThat season, he scored 45 goals en route to totaling 100 points, winning the Stanley Cup, and finishing fourth in Hart Trophy voting. Staal was a star for Carolina in that playoff run, and his 28 points led all players in the postseason.\n\nStaal spent the first 12 seasons of his career with the Hurricanes, and he notched 775 points in 909 games with the franchise. Since the Hurricanes traded him to the Rangers midway through the 2015-16 season, Staal has played for five different teams, spending four years with the Minnesota Wild from 2016 to 2020. Staal just recently completed the third Stanley Cup Final of his career with the Florida Panthers.\n\nThomas Vanek | LW\n\nPick: No. 5 overall\n\nTeam: Buffalo Sabres\n\nAll-Star: 2009\n\nScoring goals is pretty important in hockey, and Thomas Vanek was pretty good at that. Vanek scored at least 20 goals in each of his first 10 NHL seasons, and he was a lethal power play weapon for most of his 14-year career.\n\nVanek scored 25 goals in his rookie season with the Sabres, and he increased that total to 43 goals in the 2006-07 campaign. From the start of the 2005-06 season through the 2013-14 season, Vanek scored a total of 277 goals. That ranked eighth in that time frame and put Vanek ahead of players like Marian Hossa, Martin St. Louis, Vincent Lecavalier, and Daniel Sedin.\n\nVanek was traded twice during that 2013-14 season, and he spent the rest of his career as a hired gun, going to any team that needed some depth scoring. Vanek spent his final NHL season with the Detroit Red Wings in 2018-19, and he ended his career with 373 goals in 1,029 games.\n\nMilan Michalek | LW\n\nPick: No. 6 overall\n\nTeam: San Jose Sharks\n\nAll-Star: 2012\n\nMichalek scored in his first NHL game with the San Jose Sharks, but he tore his ACL early in his second career game. That forced Michalek to miss the rest of the 2003-04 season, but he rebounded with 17 goals and 18 assists in the first season after the 2004-05 lockout.\n\nIn each of his next four seasons, including his first after being traded to the Ottawa Senators in 2009-10, Michalek eclipsed the 20-goal mark. After being limited to 66 games and 18 goals in 2010-11, Michalek exploded for 35 goals and 60 points in 2011-12, the best season of his career. He was named to the All-Star Game, but Michalek wouldn't reach that level again.\n\nIn 2016, Michalek was dealt to the Toronto Maple Leafs, and he played a total of 18 games for the franchise before ending his NHL career in 2017.\n\nRyan Suter | D\n\nPick: No. 7 overall\n\nTeam: Nashville Predators\n\nAll-Star: 2012, 2015, 2017\n\nSuter didn't play his first NHL game until the 2005-06 season, but has spent nearly two decades as a staple on blue lines ever since. The following season, Suter broke out for eight goals and 16 assists as he became one of the best defensive players for Nashville.\n\nThat is how things would remain through the 2011-12 season. Suter picked up some Norris Trophy votes on an annual basis while playing at an elite level. In 2010-11, Suter played an integral role in getting the Predators past the first round of the playoffs for the first time, and he did the same thing the following season when they defeated the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Suter signed a massive 13-year, $98 million contract with the Minnesota Wild. He played the next nine seasons as a top-pairing defenseman with the Wild before the team bought him out following the 2020-21 campaign. For the past two seasons, Suter has played for the Dallas Stars, and he still has two years remaining on his contract.\n\nIn 1,362 career games, Suter has tallied 103 goals, 561 assists, and 664 points. At this point, his case for the Hall of Fame has been all but solidified.\n\nDion Phaneuf | D\n\nPick: No. 9 overall\n\nTeam: Calgary Flames\n\nAll-Star: 2007-2008, 2012\n\nThe 6-foot-4 Phaneuf was a highly-touted defensive prospect who had the size and scoring touch to play in the NHL. Early in his career with the Calgary Flames, things went according to plan for Phaneuf.\n\nAs a rookie in 2005-06, Phaneuf scored 20 goals and totaled 49 points. He earned first-team All-Rookie honors and finished third in Calder Trophy voting. Two seasons later, Phaneuf put up 60 points and a whopping 182 penalty minutes in 82 games, and he was the Norris Trophy runner-up to Nicklas Lidstrom in 2008.\n\nThe Flames traded Phaneuf to the Maple Leafs in January of 2010 as part of a blockbuster deal. Phaneuf played parts of seven seasons in Toronto, but the team only reached the postseason once in that time.\n\nThe Leafs traded Phaneuf the Ottawa Senators in 2016, and he was part of the team that went to the Eastern Conference Final in 2017. After spending two years with the Los Angeles Kings from 2017 to 2019, Phaneuf officially announced his retirement in 2021. He tallied 137 goals and 357 assists in 1,048 career games.\n\nJeff Carter | C\n\nPick: No. 11 overall\n\nTeam: Philadelphia Flyers\n\nAll-Star: 2009, 2017\n\nWith Carter, we kick off a run of players with multiple Stanley Cup victories to their name. In 2005-06, Carter kicked off what would become a spectacular career with 23 goals and 42 points in 81 games. In his six seasons with the Flyers, Carter scored 181 goals, which ranked 17th in that time.\n\nIn 2010, Carter was injured for a portion of the Flyers' Stanley Cup Final run, but he still scored five goals in 12 games.\n\nThe Flyers traded Carter to the Columbus Blue Jackets in June of 2011, but he didn't stay there for long. The Jackets sent him to the Los Angeles Kings before the 2012 trade deadline, and he instantly became a key piece of their Stanley Cup team. Carter was tied for the league lead in playoff goals, along with teammates Dustin Brown and Anze Kopitar, as L.A. won its first Cup in franchise history.\n\nTwo years later, Carter helped lead the Kings to another Stanley Cup with 10 goals and 25 points in 26 playoff games. Carter went on to spend a decade with the Kings, and he scored 194 goals in 580 games.\n\nCarter's tenure with the Kings ended when he was traded to the Penguins in 2021, and he has one year left on his contract there.\n\nDustin Brown | RW\n\nPick: No. 13 overall\n\nTeam: Los Angeles Kings\n\nAll-Star: 2009\n\nCarter's teammate on those Cup-winning teams, Dustin Brown, was selected just two picks after him in the 2003 draft. Brown, a star for the OHL's Guelph Storm in junior hockey, didn't take long to adapt to the professional level.\n\nIn 2005-06, his first full NHL season, Brown found the back of the net 14 times as he established himself within the Kings' lineup. In 2008, Brown was named the 13th captain in Kings history, and he was named an NHL All-Star later that season.\n\nBrown never put up eye-popping numbers, but he was a strong two-way forward for much of his career. In 2012 and 2014, Brown led the Kings to a pair of Stanley Cup championships. In the first of those runs, Brown put up 20 points in 20 games.\n\nIn the 2016 offseason, Brown was stripped of his captaincy and replaced by Anze Kopitar, but he remained with the Kings for the entirety of his career. Brown retired from the NHL following the 2021-22 season, after 325 goals and 712 points in 1,296 games. He became the third Kings player, along with Wayne Gretzky and Luc Robitaille to get a statue built in his honor.\n\nBrent Seabrook | D\n\nPick: No. 14 overall\n\nTeam: Chicago Blackhawks\n\nAll-Star: 2015\n\nThree-time Stanley Cup winner Brent Seabrook was drafted immediately behind two-time winner Dustin Brown in the middle of the first round. Talk about a deep draft, and we aren't even close to done.\n\nAlong with fellow defenseman Duncan Keith, Seabrook was one of the first real building blocks of the Blackhawks' dynasty that ran from 2010 to 2015. Seabrook fully entrenched himself as an everyday NHL defenseman in 2006-07, and he was an absolute workhorse for the Blackhawks for the next dozen seasons. From 2006-07 to 2018-19, Seabrook played in 1,013 games, which was second only to Patrick Marleau.\n\nIn each of Chicago's three Stanley Cup runs, Seabrook averaged at least 23:05 of ice-time per game. In Game 7 of the Hawks' second-round series against the Detroit Red Wings in 2013, Seabrook scored the overtime winner to send them to the Western Conference Final.\n\nInjuries marred the last couple seasons of Seabrook's career, and his contract was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2021. Once that deal expires after the 2023-24 campaign, Seabrook will officially retire.\n\nZach Parise | LW\n\nPick: No. 17 overall\n\nTeam: New Jersey Devils\n\nAll-Star: 2009\n\nIt took a whole three picks to find another All-Star. Coming out of the University of North Dakota, Parise quickly evolved into an elite offensive weapon for the New Jersey Devils. In 2006-07, just his second NHL season, Parise scored 31 goals.\n\nThat kicked off a run of four straight seasons in which Parise piled up 146 goals, which ranked sixth in the NHL over that span. A torn meniscus at the start of the 2010-11 season ended that streak by limiting Parise to 13 games played, but he rebounded in a big way the following season. Parise scored 31 goals in the regular season before leading the Devils to the 2012 Stanley Cup Final.\n\nThat was Parise's last season with the Devils because he joined Ryan Suter in signing a 13-year deal worth $98 million with the Minnesota Wild in the summer of 2012. Parise's time in Minnesota was hampered by injuries at times, but he still managed to score 199 goals in nine seasons.\n\nAfter the Wild bought out Parise's contract in 2021, he found a home with the New York Islanders, where he has extended his career. Parise scored 21 goals with the Isles in 2022-23 and is set to become a free agent on July 1.\n\nRyan Getzlaf | C\n\nPick: No. 19 overall\n\nTeam: Mighty Ducks of Anaheim\n\nAll-Star: 2008-2009, 2015\n\nThroughout his junior hockey career with the Calgary Hitmen, Getzlaf was an ill-tempered two-way center, and he brought that game to the NHL after getting drafted by the Ducks. Getzlaf spent the entirety of his career bullying opponents and getting under their skin after the whistle.\n\nIn just his second NHL season, Getzlaf played a significant role in the Ducks winning their first Stanley Cup in team history. He totaled 58 points in the regular season, and Getzlaf put up seven goals and 10 assists in 21 playoff games.\n\nGetzlaf never won another Cup in his career, all of which was spent in Anaheim, but he got agonizingly close. The Ducks lost in Game 7 of the second round twice, and they lost in the Western Conference Final twice more. In his 125 career playoff games, Getzlaf notched 37 goals and 83 assists for 120 points.\n\nFollowing the 2021-22 season, Getzlaf retired as the Ducks' all-time leader in games played (1,157), assists (737), and points (1,019).\n\nBrent Burns | RW\n\nPick: No. 20 overall\n\nTeam: Minnesota Wild\n\nAll-Star: 2011, 2015-2019\n\nBurns made his name as a defenseman for the San Jose Sharks, but he was drafted as a winger, and he spent some time switching between forward and defense in the early portion of his career with the Wild. Burns eventually stuck on the blue line, and that played out quite nicely for him.\n\nThroughout his seven seasons in Minnesota, Burns developed into a strong offensive defenseman, but his career took the next step after he was traded to the Sharks during the 2011 NHL Draft. For much of his tenure with San Jose, it seemed like Burns just continued to improve every season. That culminated in the 2016-17 season when he won the Norris Trophy and finished fourth in Hart Trophy voting after tallying 29 goals and 72 points in 82 games.\n\nWith the Sharks rebuilding, they traded Burns to the Carolina Hurricanes last summer, and he had a resurgent season with his new team. Despite turning 38 late in the season, Burns still managed to produce 61 points in top-pairing minutes. Expect him to be a big part of Carolina's defense again next season.\n\nRyan Kesler | C\n\nPick: No. 23 overall\n\nTeam: Vancouver Canucks\n\nAll-Star: 2011, 2017\n\nKesler, who spent time with the under-18 U.S. national team and Ohio State University before getting drafted, was a bit of a late bloomer. He didn't really break out at the NHL level until the 2007-08 season, but once he did, Kesler became a key player on great teams for the Vancouver Canucks and Anaheim Ducks.\n\nIn that 2007-08 campaign, Kesler notched 21 goals in 80 games and became a steady two-way presence in the Vancouver lineup. In 2011, Kesler won the Selke Trophy as the NHL's best defensive forward while helping the Canucks win the President's Trophy and reach the Stanley Cup Final, where they lost to the Boston Bruins in seven games.\n\nKesler was traded to the Ducks in 2014 and was immediately named an alternate captain. In his first three seasons with Anaheim, Kesler scored 63 goals and totaled 153 points while finishing top-three in Selke voting twice. In that span, the team went to the Western Conference Final twice, but it lost both times.\n\nAfter the 2016-17 season, a hip injury derailed Kesler's career, and he played his last NHL game in 2019. He retired with 573 points in 1,001 games played.\n\nMike Richards | C\n\nPick: No. 24 overall\n\nTeam: Philadelphia Flyers\n\nAll-Star: 2008\n\nThe Flyers were able to select Jeff Carter and Mike Richards in the same draft, just 13 picks apart, and both players are two-time Stanley Cup winners. Unfortunately for Philadelphia, they won those Cups with the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nRichards scored 21 goals combined in his first two seasons with the Flyers, and he broke out for 28 goals and 75 points in the 2007-08 season. In September of 2008, Richards was named the 17th captain in Flyers history. In the 2010 playoffs, Richards captained Philadelphia to the Stanley Cup Final and recorded 23 points in 23 games.\n\nIn 2011, the Flyers traded Richards to the Kings, where he would eventually be reunited with Carter. In his first year with Los Angeles, Richards totaled 44 points before adding 15 more in the team's run to a Stanley Cup. Two years later, Richards produced 10 points in the Kings' second Stanley Cup run.\n\nRichards' time with the Kings came to an end following an off-ice incident in 2015, but he signed a one-year contract with the Washington Capitals in January of 2016. He played 39 games in Washington before ending his career.\n\nBrian Boyle | C\n\nPick: No. 26 overall\n\nTeam: Los Angeles Kings\n\nAll-Star: 2018\n\nFew players in this draft class are as well-traveled as Brian Boyle. A solid bottom-six forward, Boyle bounced around as an NHL journeyman throughout his career and created value for himself by playing a strong two-way game.\n\nBoyle spent just two seasons with the Los Angeles Kings before getting traded to the New York Rangers in 2010. In his second season with the Rangers, Boyle recorded a career-high 21 goals and played a key role for the team until he signed with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2014.\n\nThat kicked off a North American tour for Boyle that resulted in him playing for seven teams in the final seven seasons of his career. In the 2017-18 season, Boyle went to his first and only All-Star Game with New Jersey after beating cancer and returning to score 13 goals in 69 games.\n\nBoyle retired in March of 2023, and even though he never won a Stanley Cup, he had his share of deep playoff runs. In fact, Boyle made back-to-back Cup Final appearances in 2014 and 2015.\n\nCorey Perry | RW\n\nPick: No. 28 overall\n\nTeam: Mighty Ducks of Anaheim\n\nAll-Star: 2008, 2011-2012, 2016\n\nThe Ducks selected Ryan Getzlaf and Corey Perry just nine picks from one another. The 2003 draft was a pretty good day at the office for GM Bryan Murray.\n\nPerry scored 30 goals in his first two NHL seasons, and he tallied 15 points in the Ducks' 2007 Stanley Cup run. He really broke out in the 2007-08 campaign, when he piled up 29 goals and 54 points in 70 games played. Three years later, Perry won the Hart Trophy after an exceptional season that included 50 goals and 98 points.\n\nPerry wound up spending 14 seasons in Anaheim, where he ranks second all-time in goals (372), third in points (776), and second in games played (988). In the summer of 2019, Perry signed with the Dallas Stars and went to the Stanley Cup Final in the NHL bubble that year. The next season, with the Montreal Canadiens, Perry lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Cup Final for the second year in a row.\n\nTaking a join them if you can't beat them approach, Perry spent the last two years with the Bolts and lost his third consecutive Stanley Cup Final in 2022. This past season, Perry totaled 12 goals and 25 points in 81 games.\n\nLoui Eriksson | LW\n\nPick: No. 33 overall\n\nTeam: Dallas Stars\n\nAll-Star: 2011\n\nWe are finally out of the first round, but there is still a long way to go. For now, we'll take a look at Loui Eriksson who was a regular 20- to 30-goal scorer at his peak.\n\nFrom 2008-09 to 2011-12, Eriksson was an exceptional top-six forward for the Dallas Stars. In those four seasons, he scored 118 goals, which ranked 19th in that time. Eriksson also established himself as a defensively responsible forward who could be trusted in all three zones.\n\nOn the Fourth of July in 2013, Eriksson was traded to the Boston Bruins in a blockbuster trade that saw Tyler Seguin going the other way. Eriksson's first season in boston didn't go as planned, but he tallied 52 goals and 110 points from 2014 to 2016.\n\nIn the 2016 offseason, Eriksson signed a six-year contract with the Vancouver Canucks, but his tenure there never really worked out. He scored 38 goals in 252 games with the Canucks and was traded to the Arizona Coyotes in 2021. Eriksson went to play in his home country of Sweden in 2022.\n\nPatrice Bergeron | C\n\nPick: No. 45 overall\n\nTeam: Boston Bruins\n\nAll-Star: 2015-2016, 2022\n\nOne of the biggest steals in draft history -- and there were several of this in this class -- came when the Boston Bruins called Patrice Bergeron's name in the second round. They wound up getting a franchise player and perhaps the best two-way forward ever to play the game.\n\nBergeron made the Bruins' roster as a rookie, and he finished eighth in voting for the 2004 Calder Trophy after notching 16 goals and 23 assists that season. Bergeron found the back of the net 31 times in the 2005-06 season, and he was off and running from there.\n\nOver the last 19 seasons, Bergeron has earned a reputation as one of the smartest players and most relentless defenders in the NHL. In his 1,294 career games, Bergeron has totaled 427 goals, 613 assists, and six Selke Trophy wins, including after the 2022-23 season.\n\nBergeron's combination of leadership, skill, and tenacity has led the Bruins to a Stanley Cup in 2011, and Boston has been back to the Stanley Cup Final twice since then. Bergeron has played a whopping 170 playoff games, and he has 128 points in that time.\n\nShea Weber | D\n\nPick: No. 49 overall\n\nTeam: Nashville Predators\n\nAll-Star: 2009, 2011-2012, 2015-2017, 2020\n\nThe Predators didn't land just one franchise defenseman in the 2003 draft. They landed two. After getting Ryan Suter at No. 7 overall, the Preds also got Shea Weber in the middle of the second round.\n\nWeber made his NHL debut in the 2005-06 season, but he carved out a regular role for himself in 2006-07. That year, Weber scored 17 goals in 79 games, and he looked like a budding star. Weber spent 11 seasons with the Predators, became the franchise's sixth captain in 2010, and was a perennial Norris Trophy candidate. While he was with Nashville, Weber became a major power play weapon, and he has scored almost as many goals on the power play (106) as he has at even strength (113) throughout his career.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, Weber was part of the stunning trade that saw him go to Montreal with P.K. Subban coming to Nashville. Weber continued to play at a high level in his first four seasons with the Habs, and he helped the team reach the Stanley Cup Final in 2020. Unfortunately, injuries derailed his career in 2020-21, and he has not played in the last two seasons. His contract currently sits with the Arizona Coyotes.\n\nCorey Crawford | G\n\nPick: No. 52 overall\n\nTeam: Chicago Blackhawks\n\nAll-Star: 2015, 2017\n\nCrawford spent the first five seasons of his professional career developing with the AHL's Norfolk Admirals and Rockford IceHogs. By the time Crawford took over the crease in Chicago, he was more than ready for the NHL level.\n\nIn 2010-11, Crawford started 55 games and posted a 2.30 GAA with a .917 save percentage. Just a couple of years later, Crawford started all 23 games in the 2013 postseason as he backstopped the Blackhawks to the Stanley Cup. His GAA was a minuscule 1.84, and his save percentage was a terrific .932.\n\nTwo years after that, Crawford did it again as he posted a pair of shutouts in 19 playoff starts. For the second time in three years, Crawford played a huge role in helping Chicago lift the Stanley Cup.\n\nCrawford held strong for a few more seasons in Chicago, but his performance dipped in 2018-19, and he played his final game for the Blackhawks in 2020. That summer, Crawford signed with the New Jersey Devils but retired before ever playing a game for them.\n\nDavid Backes | RW\n\nPick: No. 62 overall\n\nTeam: St. Louis Blues\n\nAll-Star: 2011\n\nDavid Backes was the third future captain to be taken in the second round of the 2003 draft, joining Weber and Bergeron. He scored 10 goals as a rookie in the 2006-07 season and quickly became an integral part of the Blues organization.\n\nBackes recorded a 31-goal season in 2008-09, and he became the 21st captain in St. Louis history prior to the 2010-11 season, which became his second 31-goal campaign. Backes wound up spending a decade with the Blues, and he ranks in the top-10 of numerous categories in the franchise record books.\n\nIn 2016, Backes signed with the Boston Bruins and spent parts of four seasons there. In 2019, Backes reached the Stanley Cup Final with the Bruins, and he totaled five points in 15 playoff games. Backes was traded to the Anaheim Ducks in 2020, and he signed a one-day contract to retire with the Blues in 2021. Backes finished his career with 248 goals and 561 points in 965 games.\n\nJimmy Howard | G\n\nPick: No. 64 overall\n\nTeam: Detroit Red Wings\n\nAll-Star: 2012, 2019\n\nHoward didn't play his rookie season until 2009-10, but he burst onto the scene with a 2.26 GAA and .924 save percentage. Howard finished second in Calder Trophy voting and eighth in Vezina Trophy voting.\n\nHoward took over the starter's crease in Detroit for the next decade, and he compiled 246 wins, 24 shutouts, a 2.62 GAA, and .912 save percentage in 543 games played. Howard backstopped the Red Wings in seven different postseasons, but he never reached the Western Conference Final.\n\nThe Red Wings didn't re-sign Howard after the 2019-20 season, and Howard announced his retirement in January of 2021.\n\nJoe Pavelski | C\n\nPick: No. 205 overall\n\nTeam: San Jose Sharks\n\nAll-Star: 2016-2017, 2019, 2022\n\nThere may be no better steal in NHL Draft history than Joe Pavelski going to the Sharks in the seventh round. Pavelski just completed his 17th NHL season, and he posted 77 points while playing on the best line in the league.\n\nPavelski played his rookie season in 2006-07, and he notched 28 points in 46 games. After that season, his role with the Sharks would only continue to grow until he rose to the status of a franchise player. Pavelski played 963 games in San Jose and led the team to the Stanley Cup Final in 2016. In the franchise record books, Pavelski still ranks second in goals (355), fourth in assists (406), and third in points (761).\n\nFollowing the 2018-19 season, Pavelski signed with the Dallas Stars as a free agent, and he has somehow taken his game to the next level. In his four seasons with the Stars, Pavelski has 240 points in 287 games. This past postseason, Pavelski totaled nine goals and 14 points in 14 games. He re-signed with the Stars on a one-year, $3.5 million contract for the 2023-24 season.\n\nTobias Enstrom | D\n\nPick: No. 239 overall\n\nTeam: Atlanta Thrashers\n\nAll-Star: 2011\n\nWe have now entered the eighth round of the 2003 draft, which is a round that no longer exists and we're on to a pick from a team that anymore either. Atlanta didn't uncover any All-Stars in the first seven rounds, but they found one here.\n\nEnstrom made the Thrashers' roster in 2007-08, and he put up 38 points in 82 games on the blue line. Those numbers earned him first-team All-Rookie honors, and Enstrom finished sixth in Calder Trophy voting. In 2010-11, Enstrom was selected to the All-Star game while he was in the midst of a career year, but he wasn't able to play in the game due to injury.\n\nEnstrom spent his entire 11-year NHL career with the Thrashers/Winnipeg Jets franchise, and he left the NHL following the 2017-18 season, when he went back to play in Sweden.\n\nDustin Byfuglien | D\n\nPick: No. 245 overall\n\nTeam: Chicago Blackhawks\n\nAll-Star: 2011, 2015-2016\n\nJust six picks after Enstrom, the Blackhawks selected Dustin Byfuglien, who would become a key member of the 2010 Stanley Cup team. Drafted as a defenseman, Byfuglien would do much of his damage in Chicago while on the wing.\n\nByfuglien spent his first five NHL seasons with the Blackhawks, and his tenure there culminated with that special 2009-10 season. He scored 34 points in 82 games, and he added 16 points in 22 playoff games. After that season, Chicago traded Byfuglien to the Trashers, were he returned to the blue line and became a force on defense.\n\nIn his nine seasons with Atlanta and Winnipeg, Byfuglien tallied 416 points in 609 games, and he helped the Jets reach the Western Conference Final in 2018. Byfuglien's time with the Jets ended on a sour note, and he hasn't played since April of 2019.\n\nJaroslav Halak | G\n\nPick: No. 271 overall\n\nTeam: Montreal Canadiens\n\nAll-Star: 2015\n\nAs if the eighth round wasn't late enough, Halak heard his name called by the Montreal Canadiens in the ninth round of the draft. That's a decent value for a goalie who just completed his 17th NHL season.\n\nHalak has bounced around quite a bit throughout his NHL career, playing mostly in a backup role, but he has taken on a starter's workload here and there. On two separate occasions, Halak has been part of a goaltending tandem that won the Jennings Trophy for the fewest goals allowed.\n\nIn the 2014-15 season, while Halak was with the New York Islanders, he earned an All-Star appearance by posting a GAA of 2.43 and a save percentage of .914. Since then, Halak has primarily been a veteran backup for various teams, most recently the New York Rangers in 2022-23.\n\nBrian Elliott | G\n\nPick: No. 291 overall\n\nTeam: Ottawa Senators\n\nAll-Star: 2012, 2015\n\nElliott was selected with the second-to-last pick in the 2003 draft. All he has done since then is play 16 seasons in the NHL.\n\nMuch like Halak, Elliott spent time alternating between backup and starter. The best seasons of his career came when he was a member of the St. Louis Blues. In the 2011-12 campaign, Halak finished the year with a GAA of 1.56 and a save percentage of .940. Both of those numbers led the league. Just a few years later, in 2014-15, Elliott posted a 2.26 GAA and a .917 save percentage.\n\nFor the past two seasons, Elliott has backed up Andrei Vasilevskiy as a member of the Tampa Bay Lightning. In 2021-22, Elliott reached the Stanley Cup Final for the first time in his career.", "tiktoken_token_count": 7436, "llama_token_count": 9390}, {"source_name": "Minneapolis Star Tribune", "author": "Sarah McLellan", "title": "Minnesota Wild acquire veteran forward Pat Maroon in trade with Tampa Bay", "description": "The three-time Stanley Cup champion led the NHL with 150 penalty minutes last season.", "url": "https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-wild-tampa-bay-lightning-pat-maroon-trade-max-cajkovic/600287036/", "text": "The Wild didn't add the veteran forward they coveted on Saturday during the first day of NHL free agency, but they did acquire that player in a trade before the weekend was over.\n\nThree-time Stanley Cup champion Pat Maroon joined the Wild on Sunday from Tampa Bay, along with minor-leaguer Max Cajkovic, in exchange for a 2024 seventh-round pick.\n\nSince the Lightning retained 20% of Maroon's contract, which expires after next season, the Wild are the hook for only $800,000, which is exactly how much General Manager Bill Guerin said the team had to spend after a quiet start to free agency. The team signed centers Vinni Lettieri and Jake Lucchini on Saturday to two-way contracts.\n\nThe rest of the Wild's salary cap space is being reserved for their restricted free agents, with goaltender Filip Gustavsson, forward Brandon Duhaime and defenseman Calen Addison needing new deals.\n\nMaroon is coming off a five-goal, nine-assist season with Tampa Bay in which he logged a league-high 150 penalty minutes in 80 games.\n\nA native of St. Louis, the 6-foot-3, 235-pound left wing has been in the NHL for 12 seasons, a career that includes stints with Anaheim, Edmonton, New Jersey and St. Louis before he won back-to-back Stanley Cups with the Lightning in 2020 and 2021. Maroon was also with the Blues in 2019 when they clinched the Cup. He became the first player in the NHL expansion era to win the Stanley Cup in three consecutive seasons with different teams.\n\nOverall, the 35-year-old has 117 goals and 171 assists for 288 points through 729 career games after being drafted in the sixth round (No. 161) by Philadelphia in 2007. In 150 playoff appearances, Maroon's recorded 23 goals and 28 assists.\n\nAs for Cajkovic, 22, he's played the last two seasons in the ECHL and American Hockey League, scoring a combined 21 goals and tallying 24 assists.\n\nA Slovakian, Cajkovic was drafted in the third round by Tampa Bay in 2019.\n\nNot only does Maroon bring the experience the Wild were looking for to complement their forward group, but he also has an energy factor \u2014 attributes that make up for the loss of Ryan Reaves, the gritty fourth-liner who signed a free-agent contract with Toronto after one season with the Wild.", "tiktoken_token_count": 512, "llama_token_count": 638}, {"source_name": "Minneapolis Star Tribune", "author": "Sarah McLellan", "title": "Wild goalie Filip Gustavsson and winger Brandon Duhaime file for arbitration", "description": "Filip Gustavsson and Brandon Duhaime, along with restricted free agent Calen Addison, are likely to agree to deals with the team in the next month.", "url": "https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-wild-salary-arbitration-filip-gustavsson-brandon-duhaime/600287654/", "text": "Talks between the Wild and some of their unsigned restricted free agents could start to accelerate.\n\nGoaltender Filip Gustavsson and forward Brandon Duhaime filed for salary arbitration ahead of Wednesday's deadline, which guarantees a resolution ... but most negotiations get finalized before a hearing is necessary.\n\nGustavsson is coming off his first season with the Wild and first exclusively in the NHL.\n\nBefore the Wild acquired him in the Cam Talbot trade with Ottawa last summer to back up Marc-Andre Fleury, Gustavsson had been roving between the minors and Senators. But he had a breakout performance with the Wild, eventually taking on more responsibility in net that included starting five of the team's six playoff games against Dallas.\n\nGustavsson, 25, finished the season 22-9-7 with a 2.10 goals-against average, .931 save percentage and three shutouts. His last contract was for two years and $1.575 million.\n\nDuhaime has been a mainstay in the Wild's lineup ever since he made the team out of training camp two years ago. During 2022-23, he tallied nine goals and an assist in 51 games as a depth winger who also killed penalties.\n\nThrough 131 career NHL games, the fourth-round draft pick by the Wild in 2016 has 15 goals and 12 assists. Duhaime's previous contract was a two-year, $1.5 million deal.\n\nBoth players can continue to communicate with the Wild, but a hearing will be set for later this month or August if a contract isn't agreed upon beforehand.\n\nIf a hearing is ultimately needed, the Wild would get to select the term of Gustavsson's deal (either one or two years). Duhaime's contract would be for one year since the 26-year-old is only one season away from being eligible for unrestricted free agency.\n\nIn a hearing, each side presents its case, which can include statistics and comparisons to similar players, and a ruling is delivered within 48 hours.\n\nBut rarely does this process play out, because most teams and players reach an agreement before requiring arbitration. Last year, there were 26 arbitration filings league-wide and only one wasn't settled before a hearing.\n\nAlso still without a deal for next season is defenseman Calen Addison, who didn't have the option to elect for salary arbitration like Gustavsson and Duhaime.\n\nWild General Manager Bill Guerin said recently the team would start negotiations soon with Addison, but the team already has budgeted how much contracts for all three players will cost. These projections have left the Wild with little flexibility this offseason because those deals could eat up most of their remaining salary cap space.\n\nLast Saturday, they signed Vinni Lettieri and Jake Lucchini to two-way contracts before acquiring veteran forward Pat Maroon, a trade with Tampa Bay in which the Lightning retained a portion of Maroon's salary so the Wild are only responsible for paying him $800,000 next season.\n\nAfter adding Maroon, Guerin said the Wild were taking their time with re-signing Gustavsson, Duhaime and Addison and there was no rush.\n\n\"Even if someone chooses [arbitration], it doesn't mean you just stop talking and you're going to wait for arbitration,\" Guerin said. \"You can still try to work something out. Whether that happens or not, we'll see.\n\n\"You just continue to grind it out.

After spending 11 seasons in a Tampa Bay sweater, he signed a four-year, $25 million deal with the Anaheim Ducks at an average annual value of $6.25 million.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it was probably one of the toughest decisions I\u2019ve ever made in my life to leave Tampa,\u201d Killorn said. \u201cBut looking over everything and talking to everyone I know, everyone I love, this was the right decision to make and I\u2019m so happy I made it. It\u2019s a little bittersweet for now, but tomorrow, everything is going to be great.\u201d\n\nRetaining Killorn ultimately ended up being unrealistic given Tampa Bay\u2019s salary cap constraints. The Lightning had just $7.325 million of cap space to work with entering the day, but used it to make the necessary moves to retool their forward lines with three value deals, signing Conor Sheary, Luke Glendening and Josh Archibald, spending a cap hit of just $3.6 million for next season\u2019s payroll to do it.\n\n\u201cAll three of these forwards are really effective checkers who will help you protect leads, can play against the other team\u2019s best players so it\u2019s not always on our first and second line to get those matchups,\u201d general manager Julien BriseBois said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s going to also free up some of our higher-scoring forwards from some of those defensive responsibilities, knowing that our players that will likely be in our bottom six are able to assume that role for us.\u201d\n\nThe team also signed goaltender Jonas Johansson, to be the team\u2019s new backup to Andrei Vasilevskiy, on a two-year deal worth a $775,000 average annual value.\n\nSheary, who averaged 16 goals the past three seasons playing with the Capitals, was a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the Penguins in 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe 31-year-old, who had 15 goals and 22 assists with a plus-9 in 82 games with Washington last season, signed a three-year deal for a $2 million average annual value. Sheary, who likely slots into a third-line wing role, also played on both special teams units for the Capitals, scoring two power-play goals and two short-handed goals. He previously carried a $1.5 million cap hit.\n\nSheary said that he received interest from other teams, but the Lightning showed the most.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of guys in the league (had) Tampa circled just because of their success in the last 10 seasons. Just their sustained success has been always something that I wanted to be a part of,\u201d Sheary said. \u201cJust that feeling that they wanted you as much as I wanted them really made my decision easy.\u201d\n\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\u2019s college football teams every day.

The power play has always been dangerous. Going into Tampa, it always seemed like a battle to go in there. So I\u2019m I\u2019m glad to be on the other side of it now.\u201d\n\nGlendening, 34, signed a two-year deal with an $800,000 average annual value. He likely will fill the team\u2019s fourth-line center spot and top penalty-killing duties left by unrestricted free agent Pierre-Edouard Bellemare.\n\nAn exemplary faceoff guy \u2014 he has a career 55.7% win percentage in the circle and a 59.7% success rate the past three seasons \u2014 Glendening spent the past two seasons in Dallas, averaging six goals and five assists and 13:10 of ice time a game. Two of his three goals last season with the Stars were short-handed. He carried a $1.5 million annual cap hit the past two seasons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to be on this side of it,\u201d said Glendening, who spent his first eight years with Detroit. \u201cI\u2019ve played against (the Lightning) for 10 years now. Obviously, they have a great team and I\u2019m just trying to be a tiny part of that. ... They already have a great team and I\u2019m just going to try to come in and help in any way I can.\u201d\n\nArchibald, who will be 31 when the season opens, signed a two-year deal worth an $800,000 average annual value. He likely will round out the team\u2019s fourth line as a right wing, bringing a physical, sandpaper game. Archibald has played parts of eight NHL seasons with Pittsburgh, Arizona and Edmonton, logging 9:59 a game in 62 games with the Penguins last season. He scored six goals and six assists and was second on the team with 195 hits, playing under a $900,000 cap hit.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be a good fit,\u201d Archibald said. \u201cJust really looking forward to getting down there bringing speed, physicality, hopefully get some chance to help out the penalty kill. I love that part of the game.\u201d\n\nThough they made retaining Killorn one of their top offseason priorities, the Lightning couldn\u2019t keep the consensus top-five unrestricted free agent.\n\nKillorn said discussions to stay in Tampa went \u201cdown to the wire,\u201d adding that he decided Friday he would pursue other options.\n\n\u201cAlex has meant so much to our organization and has a very important place in the history of our franchise,\u201d BriseBois said. \u201cTremendous, tremendous leader on the ice, in the locker room, in the community. Really happy for him. He\u2019s getting a great opportunity in Anaheim. I know he did not necessarily want to leave ... we didn\u2019t want to lose him but sometimes the economics of the business come into play and we just couldn\u2019t bridge the difference.\u201d\n\nJohansson, 27, has just 35 NHL games under his belt, most recently going 2-0-0 with a 2.10 goals-against average and .932 save percentage in three games with Colorado. He spent most of last season in the AHL, posting a 14-9-2 record, a 2.33 GAA and .920 save percentage. He will presumably be second on the Lightning\u2019s goaltender depth chart above AHL Syracuse goaltender Hugo Alnefelt and the favorite to replace veteran Brian Elliott behind Vasilevskiy.\n\nGoing into Saturday, the Lightning had only 17 players under one-way contracts. Included in that, they had just eight forwards on one-year deals for 2023-24. Tanner Jeannot will make the ninth after receiving a qualifying offer as an arbitration-eligible restricted free agent, but his upcoming raise isn\u2019t included in that space.\n\nThe team parted ways with bottom-six forwards Ross Colton, trading the pending restricted free agent to Colorado for a high second-round pick in the draft. The Lightning also acquired a seventh-round pick next season from Chicago for the rights to veteran Corey Perry, who then signed a one-year, $4 million with the Blackhawks.\n\nIan Cole signed a one-year, $3 million deal with Vancouver, but BriseBois said he didn\u2019t expect to acquire another defenseman to replace him, going with the existing seven defensemen under contract to made up the opening night blue line.\n\nTo add additional forward depth, the Lightning also signed Logan Brown and Mitchell Chaffee to one-year, two-way contracts, each one worth $775,000 at the NHL level.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

BriseBois on Wednesday moved up to No. 37 overall, the fifth pick in the second round, by trading forward Ross Colton to Colorado. Thursday, Tampa Bay traded into the fourth round, reacquiring the pick it sent to Nashville as part of the Tanner Jeannot trade in February for the 2024 fourth-rounder it received from Chicago in the 2022 Brandon Hagel acquisition.\n\nThe Lightning used their first pick to select a player who appears to fit their \u201cBolt\u201d mentality, right wing Ethan Gauthier. The 18-year-old recently completed his second season with the Sherbrooke Phoenix of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. With their fourth-round pick, they took Jayson Shaugabay, the top high school hockey player in the country\u2019s biggest hockey state, Minnesota.\n\nThe Lightning parted ways with pending unrestricted free agent Corey Perry, sending his rights to the Blackhawks for a seventh-round pick in next year\u2019s draft.

Gauthier showed tremendous offensive skill last season with Sherbrooke, amassing 30 goals and 69 points in 62 games and winning the 2022-23 Mike Bossy Trophy (awarded to the QMJHL\u2019s top prospect for the upcoming NHL Draft). Despite size (5-11-1/2, 183 pounds) that might scare off some teams, the Lightning view him as a complete two-way player.\n\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\u2019s college football teams every day.

He has a lot of hockey sense, compete and skill, so it brings the whole package. He\u2019s not the biggest guy physically, but nobody told him that, because he plays pretty physical. So, he brings all the attributes.\u201d\n\nLate Thursday night, BriseBois announced in a news release that Murray, who has overseen 13 drafts for the Lightning, has been reassigned to the position of senior advisor to the general manager. Longtime amateur scout John Rosso, the organization\u2019s assistant player personnel director since 2019, will be in charge of all amateur scouting operations, as well as draft preparation and execution, moving forward.\n\nGauthier was the top pick in the 2021 QMJHL entry draft, so his offensive skill is well known. But he also showed the ability to play physically and work hard defensively. Murray said he is flexible enough to play any of the three forward spots along all four lines.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the kind of guy who gives himself 12 chances to make a forward group,\u201d Murray said.\n\nShaugabay, 18, was this year\u2019s Minnesota Mr. Hockey, an accolade that goes to the state\u2019s top high school player.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a really exciting feeling, a feeling I\u2019ll never forget, and also a feeling that\u2019s a huge dream of yours when you\u2019re a kid,\u201d Shaugabay said in a phone interview. \u201cSo, to finally experience that is pretty special. I didn\u2019t really know where I was going to go, but I\u2019m very excited for where I did go.\u201d\n\nShaugabay had 33 goals and 96 points in 32 games as a senior at Warroad High School. His 304 points during his four-year career passed the school scoring record set by his cousin, current NHLer T.J. Oshie.\n\n\u201cHe just obliterated their scoring stats for career and for season,\u201d Murray said. \u201cHe\u2019s an elite offensive player. He\u2019s got hockey sense and skill. And like a lot of young players, he\u2019s going to take some time to get bigger, stronger, faster. So, a number of years ahead, no need to rush him. But he brings the skill level that we\u2019re looking for in players.\u201d\n\nShaugabay will play full-time for USHL Green Bay this season \u2014 he skated part-time for the Gamblers the past two seasons \u2014 before advancing to college hockey. He is committed to Minnesota-Duluth.\n\nThe Lightning selected defenseman Warren Clark in the sixth round. Clark had six goals and 32 assists in 55 games with the Steinbach Pistons of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League last season. He will play at St. Cloud State, which produced Lightning defenseman Nick Perbix. Murray said Clark has similar attributes with his size (6-foot-3, 185 pounds), smooth skating and poise with the puck in his end.\n\nWith the first of their two seventh-round picks, the Lightning chose center Jack Harvey from the USHL\u2019s Chicago Steel. Harvey, 20, had 40 goals and 34 assists in 62 games last season. Listed at 5-feet-10, 176 pounds, he was passed over in the previous two drafts. Murray said the Lightning like Harvey\u2019s skill, and he has improved his competitiveness as he prepares to play at Boston University.\n\nThe Lightning took defensive-minded center Ethan Hay of the Ontario Hockey League\u2019s Flint Firebirds with their final pick. Hay, 6-feet-1, 190 pounds, had 17 goals and 11 assists in 64 games this past season. Murray said the 18-year-old can play all three forward spots, is strong in the faceoff circle and has \u201cbite\u201d that shows a strong checking game.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

I know I can. It was a little bit of a frustrating season in a sense last year after getting scratched for a long time. But I\u2019m looking forward to a new opportunity and showing what I can do going in on a clean slate with a new organization. It\u2019ll be nice to be down in the Sunshine State for a full season.\u201d\n\nA former first-round pick of the Islanders in 2009, de Haan has played 573 NHL games with the Islanders, Carolina and Chicago.\n\nde Haan admitted he thought he might not have a chance to continue his career with the way last season ended in Carolina, but appears hungry for another chance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always that thought,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been working hard, training hard and looking for an opportunity.

And they get to learn how we respond to coaching. Everybody\u2019s different. It\u2019s been awesome.

Colton was made a qualifying offer by the Lightning, and his rights now belong to Colorado.\n\n\u201cIn an ideal world, not unlike in years past, I\u2019d be able to bring everyone back,\u201d BriseBois said. \u201cBut that\u2019s just not the reality in a flat-cap world. And had to make decisions as to how best to allocate our cap space, and considering what we project that Ross will be awarded had we gone to salary arbitration, it just made more sense to trade him and use that cap space somewhere else and get an asset in return to hopefully replenish the pipeline.\u201d\n\nColton had 16 goals and 16 assists last season while playing primarily on the Lightning\u2019s third line. It was a dip from his 22-goal, 17-assist first full NHL season in 2021-22 but enough to get a major salary bump. After the 2020-21 season, Colton signed a two-year, $1.125 million average annual value (AAV) contract as an arbitration-eligible restricted free agent. He was projected for a $3.351 million AAV offseason extension, according to Evolving Hockey.\n\nBriseBois said he knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to retain Colton, unrestricted free agent Alex Killorn and restricted free agent Tanner Jeannot but still hopes he can keep two of the players. He said he\u2019s had conversations with Killorn\u2019s representatives, and both sides are looking for a solution to make him a career-long Lightning player. Tampa Bay has made a qualifying offer to Jeannot, who was acquired at the deadline for five draft picks and defenseman Cal Foote.\n\n\u201cAll of us want him to stay,\u201d BriseBois said of Killorn. \u201cHe\u2019s a big part of our organization and has played a huge role in the past. ... Alex has stated publicly as well that he has a very strong preference to play for the Lightning and continue his career here and end his career with us, which is what we\u2019re trying to accomplish here. But, obviously, we haven\u2019t come to terms yet.\u201d\n\nA fourth-round pick out of the USHL in 2016, Colton was a player development success story. After college hockey at Vermont, he played two full seasons at AHL Syracuse before joining the Lightning six weeks into the 2020-21 season, playing first on the team\u2019s fourth line. He could play center or wing, score goals, and brought a strong possession, puck-battling and forechecking game. Armed with a rocket shot from the right circle, he emerged as a scoring threat on Tampa Bay\u2019s second-team power-play unit, scoring four of his 16 goals last season with the man-advantage.\n\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\u2019s college football teams every day.

Explore all your options\n\nA fan favorite, Colton scored the only goal in the Lightning\u2019s 1-0 win over the Canadiens in Game 5 of the 2021 Stanley Cup final. He also scored the winner on the road in Game 2 of the second-round series against Florida in 2022. It helped to propel Tampa Bay to a four-game sweep of the Presidents\u2019 Trophy winner on its way to a third straight Stanley Cup final, where it lost to Colorado.\n\n\u201cRoss was a fabulous player for our organization, a very popular player, a very popular teammate,\u201d BriseBois said. \u201cHe\u2019s another success story from our draft team and our development program. He put in the work ... worked his way into being an NHL regular and a Stanley Cup winner and scored a huge goal to help us clinch a Stanley Cup in 2021, and no one can ever erase that. I\u2019m really appreciative of the way he went about his business, the way he conducted himself and worked his way into becoming an NHL player. That\u2019s role-model stuff for our future prospects.\u201d\n\nThe Lightning currently have just 17 players under one-way contracts and only about $7.325 million of cap space left, including the final year of retired defenseman Brent Seabrook\u2019s contract, which allows them $6.875 million of cap space through long-term injured reserve.\n\nBriseBois said he doesn\u2019t see further need to trade another player to become cap-compliant this season.\n\nBefore trading Colton, the Lightning didn\u2019t have a pick in this year\u2019s draft until the sixth round (179th overall). Despite being focused on their one sixth-round pick and two seventh-rounders, the Lightning\u2019s amateur scouting department prepared a list of targets in case the team made a trade to acquire a higher pick. The draft gets underway with the first round Wednesday night, followed by rounds 2-7 on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe have our list prepared for whatever (BriseBois) throws at us,\u201d Lightning amateur scouting director Al Murray said last week. \u201cIf there\u2019s a high first-round pick or mid-first-round pick right through the end of the seventh, there\u2019s players in all areas that we think will be there if we were to pick in those areas.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

That doesn\u2019t include defenseman Darren Raddysh, who is currently on a two-way deal but will almost certainly make the opening night roster.\n\nGeneral manager Julien BriseBois is always looking to upgrade, but he\u2019d have to unload a player to create cap space. That\u2019s not entirely impossible, but at this point in the free agency season, this is the roster we should expect going into training camp in September.\n\nThe Lightning have had to part ways with several key pieces \u2014 Alex Killorn, Ross Colton Pat Maroon and Corey Perry among them \u2014 and BriseBois brought their replacements in with a focus on becoming faster and better defensively. Now that the roster for the upcoming season appears to be complete, what do we make of it?\n\nWhere does Conor Sheary fit in?\n\nAmong the Lightning\u2019s free-agency additions, the 31-year-old Sheary figures to make the biggest impact among the newcomers. He averaged 16 goals a year in his past three seasons in Washington. The Lightning had to go bargain shopping in free agency and Sheary \u2014 signed to a three-year, $2 million average annual value contract \u2014 is the only newcomer making more than a $1 million annually and the only one to get a deal of more than two years.\n\nSheary can play across any of the top three lines; in Washington, he shared a line with Alex Ovechkin. Last season, he assisted on seven of Ovechkin\u2019s goals. As part of Pittsburgh teams that won back-to-back Stanley Cups, Sheary played with Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. Not every player can excel skating with elite talent, and Sheary could get a look with Brayden Point and Nikita Kucherov on the Lightning\u2019s top scoring line. Brandon Hagel showed he could mesh with Point and Kucherov, but he might be better used alongside Anthony Cirelli on the two-way line.\n\nSheary can player on either wing, and his defense and forechecking can fit all over. His flexibility to play in different spots will be beneficial to the Lightning as Jon Cooper finds the right fit, especially after losing a top-six forward in Killorn.\n\nHow important is a full season of Tanner Jeannot?\n\nThe departure of Killorn and Maroon puts a lot of pressure on Tanner Jeannot as he enters his first full season in a Tampa Bay uniform. The Lightning would love to see him regain the 24-goal form of his rookie season two years ago. That would help them replace Killorn\u2019s offensive output, and they\u2019ll also need him play the role of the team\u2019s primary enforcer with Maroon gone.\n\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\u2019s college football teams every day.

Explore all your options\n\nIt took Jeannot some time to find his footing with the Lightning, and he was just starting to look comfortable when he was injured late in the regular season. It will be important for him to get off to a quick start this season. He had 17 goals in his first 51 games during his rookie season. He is a guy who will do most of his damage offensively in front of the net, and the big difference in his scoring dropoff was his shooting percentage falling from 19.4 to 5.6.\n\nNo matter where he plays in the middle six, he should get plenty of opportunities to score. He could even see power-play time with the Lightning needing to replace Killorn\u2019s presence in front, but he\u2019ll have to convert more to make the difference the Lightning want.\n\nIf he does slot into a third-line role, he will pair with Nick Paul, who was on pace for a 31-goal season before he ended with just one goal and a 2.2 shooting percentage in his last 38 regular-season games. They both can\u2019t be that streaky.\n\nHow will the blue line look?\n\nWhether the Lightning\u2019s defenseman corps is better next season remains to be seen, but there\u2019s definitely more options than this time last year. That means there will be more competition for third pairing minutes.\n\nThe departure of Ian Cole, who was a stabilizing veteran but led the team in penalties, left the Lightning with just three left-shot defensemen. The signing of Calvin de Haan gives them a fourth and he will compete with Haydn Fleury for third pairing minutes.\n\nKeep in mind that last year\u2019s opening night roster didn\u2019t include right-shot defensemen Zach Bogosian, who was injured, or Nick Perbix or Darren Raddysh, who opened the season at AHL Syracuse. All three will be in the fold going into this season along with top right-shot defenseman Erik Cernak.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what happens with right-shot defenseman Philippe Myers, the forgotten front piece of the Ryan McDonagh trade. BriseBois spoke glowingly of him at the end of last season, and he carries a $1.4 million cap hit. He was an emergency option for the Lightning late in the playoffs, but spent the entire season in Syracuse after he was demoted in early December.\n\nMikhail Sergachev took a huge step forward in his offensive game with career highs in assists (54) and points (64) while assuming a new role on the first power-play unit, but he knows he still has work to do as he enters the first year of an eight-year, $68 million extension.\n\nDo the Lightning have better depth at forward?\n\nWith the signings of Sheary, Luke Glendening and Josh Archibald, the Lightning have 12 forwards on one-way NHL contracts, but added Logan Brown and Mitchell Chaffee on two-way contracts. BriseBois said both will have the opportunity to \u201csteal a job\u201d in training camp. The Lightning still don\u2019t know where Alex Barre-Boulet fits after another season of putting up numbers in the AHL with a career-high 84 points. As of now, he\u2019s the team\u2019s 12th forward on an NHL deal and would have to clear waivers again if he doesn\u2019t make the opening roster.\n\nBrown and Chafee will also compete for a forward spot along with Cole Koepke and Gabriel Fortier, both of whom saw time in Tampa last season, and prospects Gage Goncalves, Lucas Edmonds and international signee Waltteri Merela will be knocking on the door.\n\nBrown is intriguing. At 6-foot-6, 218 pounds, he has size you can\u2019t teach. He has first-round pedigree and 99 games of NHL experience, and while his scoring numbers haven\u2019t duplicated his juniors and AHL success, he can earn a bottom-six job by playing a heavy game.\n\nHow much will goaltender Jonas Johansson play?\n\nThe biggest revelation that emerged from the Lightning\u2019s playoff postmortem was Andrei Vasilevskiy\u2019s admission that he felt out of whack from the midseason mark. In signing Johansson to be Vasilevskiy\u2019s backup, the Lightning were delighted to pick up a young goaltender they feel has untapped potential for the league minimum of $775,000.\n\nJohansson is 27 and has great size (6-5, 220 pounds), and the club hopes he might be able help Vasilevskiy carry the load with more consistency than departed 38-year-old Brian Elliott, who certainly played better than his numbers showed early, but saw his game really fade down the stretch.\n\nJohansson has never really gotten a chance at the NHL level, playing no more than 15 games in any of his four seasons. But he put up good numbers in his last stop in Colorado (10-3-2, .901 save percentage, 2.78 goals against average over parts of two seasons) and had a .920 save percentage and 2.33 GAA last season in the AHL.\n\nIf he can provide anything comparable to those numbers while giving Vasilevskiy \u2014 who has averaged 73 games (including the playoffs) the past four years \u2014 some added rest, this might be the team\u2019s best bargain signing. He will get the opportunity to show his value.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

(Photo by Andrew Bershaw/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nThe bigger question is whether the Ducks can take a step forward in 2023-24, even with Killorn on the roster. Anaheim finished last season 37 points short of a playoff berth.\n\nIf Killorn declines in the years to come he may not be an impact player by the time the Ducks are ready to win. Anaheim is willing to take that chance partly due to the fact the team has $27,873 million in cap space even after inking Killorn.\n\nIt's possible that this deal will not be an efficient use of funds for the team, but Anaheim has such an abundance of funds that efficiency isn't top of mind. Bringing Killorn in now might be early in the context of the Ducks' competitive window, but he's a luxury they can afford.\n\nThe winger's experience in 11 years with the Tampa Bay Lightning could also prove valuable as he has the credibility to set an example for some of Anaheim's younger players.

Coming off his first professional season at AHL Syracuse, the defenseman feels like he\u2019s stronger and smarter. For many, the AHL is a crash course in physicality and speed of the game, and it can take time to perfect both.\n\nThompson was pleased with how he tested in the weight room during the Lightning\u2019s development camp earlier this month, showing improvement everywhere, notably with his skating. But for Thompson, one of the best lessons he learned from his introduction to pro hockey was watching one of his older teammates graduate to an NHL contributor.\n\nDarren Raddysh is six years older than the 21-year-old Thompson. The Lightning were his third organization, so he\u2019s seen a lot more. But Thompson said that playing alongside Raddysh, a fellow right-shot defenseman, helped him understand what it takes to be successful in the AHL and earn a promotion to the NHL. Raddysh opened last season in Syracuse, was called up by the Lightning in March, then ended the season averaging 25 minutes a game in the playoffs.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re similar sizes, and I think just how he positions himself in the defensive zone,\u201d Thompson, the Lightning\u2019s third-round pick in 2020, said of Raddysh. \u201cWe both aren\u2019t going to run guys over, let\u2019s say, but I think he\u2019s really good with his stick. He\u2019s really good at his body positioning. And then once he gets the puck, he has really good patience. ... And he\u2019s talked to me a lot. He still talks to me every day. We\u2019re pretty good buddies. And I thank him for that.\u201d\n\nExamples all over\n\nSeeing is believing with greener players. It\u2019s no coincidence that when the Lightning hold their development camp every summer, stars like Nikita Kucherov and Andrei Vasilevskiy also train at the same time. Brayden Point is there leaning up against the glass watching skill drills. Being around champion players serves as an added layer of motivation.\n\nWhile the development camp includes weight room testing, skills and skating drills, and 3-on-3 competitions, the film study work that prospects do is equally important. They watch how players like Point improved his skating to become an elite goal scorer, and they analyze their own film year over year to see their progress.\n\n\u201cI had a few discussions with the younger guys and you can definitely see, you know, they\u2019re looking up to guys, all these guys have been through the system,\u201d said Lightning player development director J.P. Cote. \u201cYou can tell they\u2019re really good at their craft, and the drills we throw at them, they\u2019re doing a good job at it.\n\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\u2019s college football teams every day.

They\u2019re younger guys, for sure, just because they\u2019re looking up, they see, \u2018OK, that\u2019s what I need to get to the pro level, the AHL and then the NHL.\u2019 And then what\u2019s fun, you have guys around. Kucherov is practicing with other guys. Vasy is here. So it feels like it\u2019s a family feeling.\u201d\n\nThe camp week begins with skating coach Barb Underhill recording players\u2019 strides with an iPad. The tablets are all over the ice at the TGH IcePlex early on in camp, positioned by the bench to record goaltenders and even at center ice for a broader view of drills. Ultimately, the goal is to use video to point out strengths and weaknesses, then show players their progress by putting clips side by side.\n\n\u201cSometimes they\u2019re not just even clips of top players in the NHL, it\u2019s about them,\u201d said new AHL Syracuse Crunch coach Joel Bouchard. \u201cIt\u2019s about seeing something that you might think you know, but then you see it from a different angle and then you just need that to click sometimes. ... It doesn\u2019t lie.\n\nAn open conversation\n\nBouchard, a well-regarded player development coach in the junior and AHL ranks, said the video starts a conversation with each player. Camp was capped by players having exit interviews with coaches and staff.\n\n\u201cI think 2023 is an open conversation,\u201d Bouchard said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s where the player takes you. ... It\u2019s about working together, putting the standard to a certain level and then when you can validate and show something that\u2019s tangible, then it makes it easier for everybody to see where we are trying to be. ...\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a generation that wants to be part of the process, and we have to include them. We have to respect how they see it from their perspective, and then come to an understanding.\u201d\n\nPlayers attending the camp come in at varying places in their careers, from 18-year-old draftees to players in junior ranks and college hockey to pros in the ECHL and AHL.\n\nForward Dylan Duke, the Lightning\u2019s fourth-round pick in 2021, was attending his third development camp. The Lightning think highly of him, and as he enters his third college season at Michigan, they have seen him make strides every year. He was one of the top players in camp this month and he credited the Lightning for helping him make major strides with his skating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely important to be able to see visuals of myself and then also learn from seeing videos of other guys,\u201d Duke said. \u201cI\u2019m a visual learner, so to see that stuff, to kind of be able to see from past couple years my stride progress, I think it\u2019s definitely getting better but something that I\u2019ve got to keep working on. I think I\u2019m a lot more powerful, my mechanics are better but nothing\u2019s perfect, so I\u2019m just gonna keep working at it every day every summer. Just trying to be the best I can be.\u201d\n\nThe Lightning have a strong player development reputation, and if they want to see how quickly they can progress, they only need to look to last summer\u2019s roster, which included Nick Perbix. Despite not making the opening night roster, Perbix played 69 games for the Lightning and ended the season with Victor Hedman in the team\u2019s top defenseman pairing.\n\n\u201cI think players are smart in 2023,\u201d Bouchard said. \u201cThey realize what they need to work on. They realize what the future will look like for them. So it\u2019s just to guide them through it and give them all the tools, and this is one thing this organization has done very well over the years.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

Babcock has been out of the NHL since being fired by the Maple Leafs in November 2019.\n\nAs for free agency, Detroit Red Wings GM Steve Yzerman said he\u2019ll make usual inquires, while acknowledging there\u2019s \u201cprobably more needs than there are players at this point.\u201d\n\nThe competitive teams - Boston, Tampa Bay, Colorado, Edmonton and defending Stanley Cup champion Vegas - are struggling to retain their own players.\n\nThe Bruins, coming off a season in which they set NHL single-season records for most wins (65) and points (135), have $10.9 million in cap space available with nine roster spots still to fill - and that\u2019s after they unloaded Taylor Hall\u2019s $6 million cap hit by trading him to Chicago.\n\nBy comparison, many of the rebuilding teams with cap space available - Philadelphia, Chicago, Arizona and Anaheim - are more focused on keeping roster spots open to develop their youth rather than add high-priced talent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for long-term contracts at this point, so don\u2019t expect too much in a couple of days on that,\u201d said Flyers general manager Danny Briere, who has spent the past month shedding veterans by trading defenseman Ivan Provorov in a three-team deal to Columbus and Kevin Hayes to St. Louis.\n\nIn the meantime, this year\u2019s free-agent class has talent, but lacks the high-profile players of past summers.\n\nThe group is headed by 34-year-old Patrick Kane, who will miss the start of the season after having hip resurfacing surgery. Kane\u2019s former Blackhawks teammate Jonathan Toews is available, though he has combined for just 27 goals and 68 points over the past two years since missing the entire 2020-21 season due to chronic immune response syndrome.\n\nTampa Bay forward Alex Killorn, who put up career-best numbers with 27 goals, 37 assists and 64 points, will attract attention, though he\u2019s 34, and the Lightning are still hoping to re-sign him. Dmitry Orlov is regarded as the free agent class\u2019s top defenseman, while Frederik Andersen, Tristan Jerry and Antti Raanta are among the goalies expected to be available.\n\nThe flat cap has led to more teams going the trade route to acquire talent because the player\u2019s salary is already established, as opposed to the uncertainty that comes with having to negotiate a contract in free agency, and the potential of other teams entering the mix and upping the price.\n\n\u201cUltimately, I think people are looking at the free agency market and it\u2019s kind of thin this year. So if they want to improve their team, they\u2019re looking at the trade market,\u201d Yzerman said. \u201cYou get some certainty if you make a trade, as opposed to going in there two days from now, and we have no idea who or what you\u2019re getting and what it\u2019s going to cost you.\u201d", "tiktoken_token_count": 866, "llama_token_count": 1062}, {"source_name": "Rivals.com", "author": "The Maize And Blue Review", "title": "Former U-M hockey standout J.T.

That made short contracts \u2014 many with performance bonuses like Pacioretty's with the Washington Capitals \u2014 a popular route for players and teams willing to take moderate risks and kick money down the road.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe had limited cap space, and we were trying to add certain elements to the team,\u201d Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan said Sunday. \u201cThat opportunity within the CBA to have a lower cap hit and carry over if those bonuses are achieved was appealing to us because we got him at a $2 million cap hit instead of a higher cap hit, which we might not have been able to afford.\u201d\n\nThey weren't alone. Of the 166 NHL unrestricted free agent contracts signed Saturday, 68 were one- or two-year deals. The Boston Bruins, New York Rangers and Edmonton Oilers were also among the teams to hand out contracts with bonus incentives.\n\nNew York signed veteran winger Blake Wheeler, fresh off his buyout in Winnipeg, to an $800,000 contract with $300,000 more in bonuses and two-time Stanley Cup-winning goaltender Jonathan Quick, fresh off backing up for Vegas on its title run, to an $825,000 contract with $100,000 more in bonuses.\n\nThat was certainly a plan going into the offseason for Rangers GM Chris Drury, who knew he'd be losing wingers Patrick Kane and Vladimir Tarasenko in free agency because of his team's cap picture.\n\n\u201cYou create your lists and get guys in order and start doing your homework,\u201d Drury said Saturday. \u201cI think everyone in this business \u2014 agents and players alike \u2014 are aware of the limited cap space we do have and did have.\u201d\n\nThat's a big club that includes everyone from the 2020 and '21 champion Tampa Bay Lightning to the Boston Bruins, coming off setting NHL records for wins and points in a regular season and losing in the first round of the playoffs.\n\n\u201cThe flat cap is difficult for all 32 GMs,\u201d Lightning GM Julien BriseBois said. \u201cIt\u2019s not tougher for me than it is for them.\u201d\n\nBriseBois was sad to see big winger Alex Killorn leave for a lucrative deal in Anaheim and Ian Cole sign in Vancouver, but he added versatile winger Conor Sheary for three years, defensive center Luke Glendening for two and depth forward Josh Archibald and defenseman Calvin de Haan for next season.\n\nThe Lightning also traded three-time Cup winner Patrick Maroon and fellow forward Max Cajkovic to Minnesota for a 2024 seventh-round pick. Tampa Bay retained 20% of Maroon's $1 million salary, which clears enough space to sign a player at the league minimum of $775,000 \u2014 perhaps with bonuses.\n\nThe Bruins similarly said goodbye to winger Tyler Bertuzzi and Garnet Hathaway and defenseman Dmitry Orlov: their three trade deadline acquisitions who helped them break the records. Boston, among several bargain contracts, brought back 2011 Cup winner Milan Lucic \u2014 on a bonus-heavy deal paying him $1 million with $500,000 in incentives.\n\nStory continues\n\nBertuzzi joined the one-year-contract trend, signing for $5.5 million with Toronto for next season.\n\nWith seasoned GM Ken Holland heading into likely his final season on the job and aiming to win right now, Edmonton was even more creative in signing winger Connor Brown, who's coming off tearing the ACL in his right knee. Brown's one-year contract is for $775,000 with $3.225 million in potential bonuses.\n\nThat's how contenders need to operate in navigating a flat cap world. So many short-term deals could set up an interesting season of motivated players in contract years and potentially set up a bigger free agent frenzy next summer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a very fluid situation, especially with a flat cap essentially for three years, and all of a sudden getting some money back hopefully next year and continuing forward,\u201d Cole said. \u201cI think we\u2019re kind of in some uncharted territories and I think it\u2019s going to be an interesting landscape moving forward.\u201d\n\nAmong the moves made Sunday:\n\n\u2014 Evan Rodrigues cashed in on his 30-point season with then-defending Stanley Cup champion Colorado by signing a $12 million, four-year contract with now-reigning Eastern Conference champion Florida.\n\n\u2014 The Avalanche re-signed defenseman Jack Johnson to a one-year contract worth $775,000.\n\n\u2014 The Detroit Red Wings signed intriguing 26-year-old forward Christian Fischer to a $1.125 million contract for next season.

He announced his retirement Wednesday on social media.\n\n\u201cI always enjoyed offseason training and getting ready for the upcoming season,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI told myself that if I ever didn\u2019t feel motivated to do it or my body wasn\u2019t in a place to want to do it anymore, that\u2019s when I\u2019d retire, knowing that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to prepare like I wanted to.\u201d\n\nHe played for the Ontario Reign of the American Hockey League for the 2022-23 season, and a month or two after the end of the season, he knew the time had come \u2014 so he \u201cmade the call\u201d on his professional career.\n\nOriginally drafted by the Boston Bruins in the sixth round of the 2003 NHL Draft, the journeyman forward from Anchorage played with nine different teams over 15 seasons. His is the second-longest NHL career by an Alaskan, behind fellow Anchorage product Scott Gomez, who played 16 seasons for seven teams.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely something I\u2019m proud of,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI was able to carve out a pretty long career and it\u2019s pretty rare to have a career like that. I\u2019m extremely proud of the fact that I was able to not only stay in the league that long but still be able to be an impact player for a long time and be consistent.\u201d\n\nNate Thompson, playing for the Anaheim Ducks, celebrates his goal against the Nashville Predators in Game Four of the Western Conference First Round during the 2016 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs at Bridgestone Arena on April 21, 2016 in Nashville, Tennessee.

I\u2019m beyond grateful and thankful for all the great people I\u2019ve met and friendships I\u2019ve made,\u201d Thompson posted on Twitter. \u201cAll good things must come to an end so thank you to all who supported me along this journey.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe finished his NHL career with 164 points (65 goals, 99 assists) and 401 penalty minutes in 844 games and added 21 points (eight goals, 13 assists) in 86 career playoff games. The team he appeared in the most career games with was the Lightning from 2009-2014 at 305 followed by the Anaheim Ducks from 2014-2017 at 159.\n\n\u201cI can proudly say that I left it all out on the ice every night,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nWhile the term journeyman can sometimes have a negative connotation associated with it, Thompson \u201ctook it as a compliment\u201d and was glad that his skills were in demand throughout his time in the league.\n\n\u201cTowards the end of my career, I was traded a lot more but at the same time, I looked at it as someone wanted me,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually I was getting traded around the deadline to go to a playoff team to try to make a run.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, he was never able to get to the Stanley Cup Finals during his career. But through his travels around the league, he came close a few times and has many friends and former coaches who have reached the game\u2019s pinnacle.\n\n\u201cI went to the conference final three times, one with Tampa and two with Anaheim,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost in game seven in two of them and game six in one.\u201d\n\nNate Thompson laughs with other players as the Alaska Aces opened their training camp on September 28, 2012. Three NHL players with roots in Anchorage joined the team for camp: Scott Gomez (Montreal Canadiens), Nate Thompson (Tampa Bay Lightning) and Joey Crabb (Washington Capitals). (Marc Lester / ADN archive 2012)\n\nDuring a brief lockout in the NHL that delayed the start of the 2012-13 season, Thompson had a 24-game stint with the Alaska Aces, which was his first time playing in his hometown since he was in high school.\n\n\u201cIt was awesome to get a chance to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be able to play at home for a minor league team was something special, not just for me, but for my parents being able to drive and come watch me play. To live at home for a couple months before I went back to Tampa to start the NHL season was something I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d\n\nNate Thompson of Alaska, center, chases Aaron Schneekloth of Colorado behind the Eagles net during first-period action Nov. 14, 2012 at Sullivan Arena. (Erik Hill / ADN archive 2012)\n\nBefore his professional career, Thompson played four years of junior hockey with the Seattle Thunderbirds from 2001-2005 and two years at the high school level in his hometown at Dimond High, where he helped lead the Lynx to a state title in the 2000-01 season.\n\nHe now lives in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles. His advice to young Alaskans looking to follow in his footsteps is \u201cto have fun and have passion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never really looked at playing hockey ever as a job my whole life, but I got to do it as a job, and I felt very lucky,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s pretty simple. Just work hard and have fun. If you don\u2019t do those things, why are you even doing it?\u201d\n\nHe believes there\u2019s more to hockey than \u201cjust making it to the NHL and being a superstar,\u201d because there are a lot of important life lessons to be learned from playing as well.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great for kids coming out of Alaska to have something like that as a foundation,\u201d Thompson said.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1277, "llama_token_count": 1553}, {"source_name": "Detroit Free Press", "author": "Detroit Free Press", "title": "Why Detroit Red Wings' addition of Alex DeBrincat make them look more like playoff team", "description": "Adding Alex DeBrincat pushes the Detroit Red Wings closer to playoff contention, especially considering what the team didn't have to give up for him.", "url": "https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nhl/red-wings/2023/07/09/detroit-red-wings-steal-alex-debrincat-trade-playoff-team-ottawa-senators/70396317007/", "text": "Your subscription supports:\n\nExclusive investigative reporting that fights for the truth, exposes corruption and gives voice to the voiceless all across Michigan.\n\nComprehensive coverage of Michigan's auto industry, including in-depth analysis of Ford, GM, and Stellantis\u2019 latest developments and innovations.\n\nDon't miss a beat with our sports coverage, featuring the Lions, Tigers, Red Wings, Pistons, Michigan and Michigan State, as well as exclusive access to USA TODAY Sports+.\n\nDive deeper into the news and sports stories that matter most with our exclusive podcasts, featuring analysis and reporting from our team of experts.", "tiktoken_token_count": 118, "llama_token_count": 152}, {"source_name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "author": "The Canadian Press", "title": "Flurry of action in NHL free agency as Leafs lose O'Reilly, Sens sign Korpisalo", "description": "The Toronto Maple Leafs waved farewell to a number of familiar faces.

He had returned to the team that drafted him in 2008 from the Vancouver Canucks.\n\nMichael Bunting then departed the Leafs for the Carolina Hurricanes on a three-year, $13.5-million contract. Toronto also lost defenceman Justin Holl to the Detroit Red Wings, who signed the polarizing blueliner to a three-year, $10.2-million deal.\n\nThe Penguins added centre Noel Acciari, who also came to Toronto in the O'Reilly deal, to a three-year, $6-million contract as Pittsburgh president of hockey operations Kyle Dubas \u2014 fired as Leafs general manager in May \u2014 made a series of splashes.\n\nToronto responded by adding hulking forward Ryan Reaves to a three-year term worth $4.05 million, while puck-moving defenceman John Klingberg heads to hockey's biggest market for one season at $4.05 million.\n\nThe Leafs also lost Alexander Kerfoot to the Arizona Coyotes, who signed the forward to a two-year contract. Terms of the new agreement were not disclosed. Last season the 28-year-old recorded 10 goals and 22 assists in 82 games for Toronto.\n\n\"You need character in your team, and sometimes you need some characters,\" Leafs GM general manager Brad Treliving said before later adding of Klingberg: \"John would be probably the first one to tell you it didn't go with exactly the way he wanted it to go last year, but he's a really good player.\"\n\nThe Senators, meanwhile, are hoping to have finally settled their long-term crease issues after inking Joonas Korpisalo to a five-year, $20-million contract.\n\n\"Goaltending was probably our biggest need,\" Ottawa general manager Pierre Dorion said. \"We feel we've addressed it.\"\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers signed Connor Brown, who missed most of last season with a knee injury, re-uniting the forward with former junior teammate Connor McDavid.\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks added to their blue line by signing Carson Soucy to a three-year, $9.75-million contract, Ian Cole to a one-year pact worth $3 million, and Matt Irwin for one year at $775,000. The club also added forward Teddy Blueger on a one-year deal worth $1.9-million.\n\nOilers general manager Ken Holland said the market is tight for a number of teams because the salary cap again rose by just $1 million for 2023-24 as the league continues to recover from the financial hardships brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"It's hard to hang onto your depth,\" Holland said. \"There's an opportunity for players to go elsewhere and make more money.\n\n\"You can't blame them.\"\n\nThe big-money moves included defenceman Dmitry Orlov getting a two-year, $15.5-million deal with Carolina after the Bruins acquired him ahead of the deadline from the Washington Capitals.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlex Killorn received a big pay day from the Anaheim Ducks with a four-year, $25-million deal after winning back-to-back Stanley Cups with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2020 and 2021.\n\nDetroit signed centre J.T. Compher to a five-year, $25.5-million contract.\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche, who let Compher walk, inked Miles Wood for the next six years, and fellow forward Jonathan Drouin for one. Colorado also re-signed restricted free agent defenceman Bowen Byram for a combined $7.7 million over the next two seasons.\n\nThe Penguins re-signed goaltender Tristan Jarry to a five-year, $26.875-million contract, added defenceman Ryan Graves on a six-year deal worth $27 million, and inked forward Lars Eller for one year at $2.45 million.\n\nThe Coyotes also signed forward Jason Zucker from Pittsburgh for one year at a reported $5.3 million.\n\nThe Seattle Kraken inked defenceman Brian Dumoulin to a two-year, $6.3-million contract, and the Predators signed Gustav Nyquist to two-year, $6.37-million contract.\n\nThe Dallas Stars took advantage of the buyout market, signing centre Matt Duchene to a one-year, $3-million deal a day after Nashville cut him loose.\n\nThe Florida Panthers signed defenceman Oliver Ekman-Larsson for one year after the Vancouver Canucks bought out his contract, and added Dmitry Kulikov for the same length to bolster the blue line even further.\n\nThe New York Islanders signed Ilya Sorokin to an eight-year contract extension that starts in 2024-25 worth a reported $66 million. The club also re-signed forward Pierre Engvall and defenceman Scott Mayfield to seven-year deals, while netminder Semyon Varlamov is staying on four more seasons.\n\nThe Winnipeg Jets signed Vladislav Namestnikov to a two-year, $4-million contract, and are also bringing back goaltender Laurent Brossoit \u2014 in the Manitoba capital from 2018 to 2021 \u2014 for one year at $1.75 million.\n\nAnd with the future of No. 1 option Connor Hellebuyck up in the air, the Jets added netminder Collin Delia for one year at $775,000.\n\nBought out by Winnipeg on Friday, former Jets captain Blake Wheeler signed a one-year deal with the New York Rangers for a reported $800,000.\n\nMilan Lucic is heading back to Boston after signing a one-year, $1-million deal with the Bruins after departing the Calgary Flames. Boston also inked forward Morgan Geekie on a two-year deal worth $4 million, and defenceman Kevin Shattenkirk for one year at $1.05 million.\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings, who acquired Korpisalo prior to the trade deadline from the Columbus Blue Jackets, signed netminder Cam Talbot to a one-year, $1-million contract.\n\nThe Anaheim Ducks signed defenceman Radko Gudas from the Panthers, while the Buffalo Sabres picked up a pair of veteran blueliners Erik Johnson and Connor Clifton.\n\nThe Hurricanes re-signed netminders Frederik Andersen and Antti Raanta. Andersen gets $6.8 million over two years, while Raanta will make $1.5 million in 2023-24.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning signed forward Conor Sheary to a three-year, $6-million deal.\n\nThe Capitals signed forward Max Pacioretty, who's coming off consecutive Achilles tendon injuries, to a one-year contract worth $2 million.\n\nOn the trade front, the Montreal Canadiens dealt defenceman Joel Edmundson to Washington for a seventh-round pick in 2024.\n\nThe annual free-agent bonanza returned to Canada Day for the first time since 2019 because of the pandemic's impact on the league calendar since 2020, but issues with Twitter limited users to a capped number of posts that could be viewed on one of hockey's busiest days.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published July 1, 2023.\n\n___\n\nFollow @JClipperton_CP on Twitter.\n\nJoshua Clipperton, The Canadian Press", "tiktoken_token_count": 1578, "llama_token_count": 1998}, {"source_name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "author": "Ian Kennedy", "title": "Prospect ranks: These teams have not-so-bright futures", "description": "The good news for most franchises with shallow prospect pools is it\u2019s a direct result of winning.

If you\u2019re missing the playoffs and still on this list, it\u2019s not a good sign, and it\u2019s likely time to examine a complete rebuild. Sadly for fans in Canadian markets, five of the seven Canadian NHL teams fall in this bottom tier, many without playoff success to show for it. Conversely, teams including the Vegas Golden Knights, Tampa Bay Lightning, and Colorado Avalanche all have Cups in recent years, utilizing picks and prospects to get them over the top.\n\nComing soon, we\u2019ll count down the NHL\u2019s best prospect pools, but for now, here\u2019s a look at the team\u2019s with the worst prospect pools in the NHL.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\n\nTop three prospects: Xavier Bourgault, Matvei Petrov, Raphael Lavoie\n\nTop pick in 2023: Beau Akey (56th overall)\n\nSorry Oilers fans, but with the graduation of Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway to the NHL, the prospect cupboard is bare. Ken Holland has a way of doing that, but he also inherited a bad prospect situation and then compounded it. Matvei Petrov could turn into a steal for the Oilers if he can duplicate his success from the OHL level in the AHL next year. The stock of two other Oilers prospects \u2014 Carter Savoie and Raphael Lavoie \u2014 needs to be determined this year. It\u2019s a group that is thin from top to bottom, and not picking until 56th overall this year didn\u2019t help.\n\nTop three prospects: Owen Pickering, Brayden Yager, Joel Blomqvist\n\nTop pick in 2023: Brayden Yager (14th overall)\n\nAfter years of not having a first round pick, the Pittsburgh Penguins have now used two in a row. Last year, they selected big blueliner Owen Pickering, followed this year by Brayden Yager, a highly skilled centre. They\u2019re the picks the Penguins have been waiting for, as the team begins trying to amass youth again. Joel Blomqvist is coming to the AHL this season after a down year, but he\u2019s the lone goaltender in the Pens system on a current NHL trajectory.\n\n30. Tampa Bay Lightning\n\nTop three prospects: Isaac Howard, Jack Thompson, Gage Goncalves\n\nTop pick in 2023: Ethan Gauthier (37th overall)\n\nIsaac Howard didn\u2019t have a great first NCAA season with Minnesota-Duluth, and Tampa will be hoping beyond hopes that his elite release starts finding the back of the net. He\u2019s the top prospect in the organization, particularly as the Lightning have not picked high often in recent years. Jack Thompson had a steady first season in the AHL with Syracuse and will likely get a look with the Lightning soon. It feels like Gage Goncalves is set to become the next overripe prospect into Tampa. He has two full seasons in the AHL under his belt without a call up, but don\u2019t count on that again next season. Other names to watch in Tampa Bay\u2019s system include Hugo Alnefelt, Dylan Duke, and Niko Huuhtanen.\n\n29. Vegas Golden Knights\n\nTop three prospects: Brendan Brisson, Matyas Sapovaliv, Lukas Cormier\n\nTop pick in 2023: David Edstrom (32nd overall)\n\nWhat the Vegas Golden Knights have is a Stanley Cup. What they don\u2019t have is a prospect pool. They traded away almost every piece and pick acquired in their first two seasons of existence for a chance to win the Stanley Cup, and it paid off in 2023. Now, Vegas needs to see how long their current roster can hold, because internal reinforcements are few and far between. Brendan Brisson was a surprise first round pick when the Golden Knights took him in 2020, but he\u2019s on track to make his NHL debut next season taking some spot duty. Matyas Sapovaliv is another player who continues to move in the right developmental direction. On the back end, Lukas Cormier had a strong rookie pro season in AHL Henderson. Vegas got solid upside at this year\u2019s draft in David Edstrom and Mathieu Cataford to give a boost to their pool. Watching how Carl Lindbom fares in the SHL this season after a strong campaign last year will be exciting for the future of Vegas\u2019 crease.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop three prospects: William Dufour, Samuel Bolduc, Matthew Maggio\n\nTop pick in 2023: Danny Nelson (49th overall)\n\nWilliam Dufour looks like a fifth round steal for the Islanders. He made his NHL debut last season thanks to a spectacular transition from junior to the AHL. Matthew Maggio looks to follow in his footsteps as another fifth round hit for the Isles. After bouncing from league to league, Ruslan Iskhakov looked like he could be nearing NHL ready up front as well. On the blueline, Samuel Bolduc had an extended NHL look last season and should be ready for a full campaign this year, while Calle Odelius was underwhelming in Sweden, but still holds potential.\n\nTop three prospects: Fabian Lysel, Brett Harrison, Matthew Poitras\n\nTop pick in 2023: Christopher Pelosi (92nd overall)\n\nWithout Fabian Lysel, this would be a dire situation for the Bruins on the prospect front. Their draft this year was abysmal, which will certainly impact their pool further in the coming seasons. When Lysel and Jakub Lauko step to the NHL, the lone forwards trending toward the NHL in the future will be Brett Harrison and Matthew Poitras. Mason Lohrei turned pro following his NCAA career at Ohio State to end last season and should factor into the Bruins\u2019 blue line plans at some point. Dans Locmelis is a wild card to watch as he moves from Europe to the NCAA this year.\n\n26. Florida Panthers\n\nTop three prospects: Mackie Samoskevich, Michael Benning, Grigori Denisenko\n\nTop pick in 2023: Gracyn Sawchyn (63rd overall)\n\nIt\u2019s a shallow pool in Florida, but a few recent NCAA players look like they could become steals. Mackie Samoskevich lived up to his first round selection at Michigan and turned pro at the end of the season. He\u2019ll get a full AHL campaign in if he doesn\u2019t make the Panthers out of camp. Perhaps the most intriguing player in Florida\u2019s system was free agent signee Ryan Mcallister, who had 139 points in Junior A two seasons ago, piled in 49 points in 39 games as an NCAA rookie, then scored five points in five games in the AHL to finish off the year. He\u2019s on a meteoric path. At the other end of the spectrum is Grigori Denisenko, who looks like he\u2019s running out of chances and could become trade bait looking for a fresh start elsewhere if he doesn\u2019t click this season in Florida. On the blue line, Michael Benning is the top prospect in the system, but if he doesn\u2019t sign in Florida following his senior season in Denver, it would be a huge loss to the Panthers.\n\n25. Colorado Avalanche\n\nTop three prospects: Jean-Luc Foudy, Oskar Olausson, Sean Behrens\n\nTop pick in 2023: Calum Ritchie (27th overall)\n\nWith the Colorado Avalanche not picking until late in the opening round of the NHL Draft, they hit a home run getting Calum Ritchie, rounded the bases, and hit another picking Mikhail Gulyayev. It was an infusion to an otherwise waning prospect pool that should give hope to Avalanche fans. Jean-Luc Foudy or Oskar Olausson could find a permanent roster spot out of camp, while Sean Behrens continues his development in the NCAA, and is a strong candidate to turn pro at the end of his season and get a handful of opportunities in Colorado. In net, Justus Annunen continues to progress and looks like he\u2019ll be earning more NHL starts in the very near future.\n\nTop three prospects: Brennan Othmann, Will Cuylle, Zac Jones\n\nTop pick in 2023: Gabe Perreault (23rd overall)\n\nIn terms of high-end skill up front, there\u2019s a lot to like about New York\u2019s prospect pool. Will Cuylle had an excellent start to his pro career with Hartford this year, earning himself a four game call up, and Brennan Othmann could do the same next year. Bryce McConnell-Barker will be back in the OHL, but took a step forward this year. How the Rangers manage Adam Sykora this season could play a major role in his future, as the Slovak came over for the AHL playoffs. And then there\u2019s the sublimely skilled Gabriel Perreault, who can flat out score. Where the Rangers fall flat is on the blue line, where Zac Jones should stick full time on New York\u2019s bottom pair this season, but beyond him, there is almost no one on the horizon. Thankfully for Rangers\u2019 fans, their blue line is already young and skilled. Dylan Garand remains the team\u2019s best netminding prospect, but only had a so-so AHL rookie campaign.\n\nTop three prospects: Jonathan Lekkerim\u00e4ki, Arturs Silovs, Tom Willander\n\nTop pick in 2023: Tom Willander (11th overall)\n\nAfter a horrific season for Jonathan Lekkerim\u00e4ki, he broke out scoring a point per game in the playoffs in Allsvenskan. He\u2019ll step up to the SHL next year, and could be a prospect needing more time than anticipated. Vancouver also acquired Aatu R\u00e4ty and Linus Karlsson, hoping a change of scenery will help them find their stride at the NHL level. Heading into this year\u2019s NHL Draft, the Canucks had almost no blue line prospects looking like NHL candidates. They addressed that in part by selecting Tom Willander and Hunter Brzustewicz, but remain shallow at the position outside of 2022 pick Elias Pettersson. Arturs Silovs\u2019 World Championship MVP performance has fans hoping he\u2019s a long term goaltending solution.\n\nFive Canadians teams rank in the bottom half in our ranking of the NHL's prospect pools. (Getty Images)\n\nTop three prospects: Connor Zary, Jakob Pelletier, Matt Coronato\n\nTop pick in 2023: Samuel Honzek (16th overall)\n\nIt would be hard to point to a team who has drafted and developed worse than the Calgary Flames over the last half decade. They\u2019ve just refused to give strong prospects a shot at the NHL, and eventually, it seems to have stunted development and confidence in many. By all rights, for a team in Calgary\u2019s position, Connor Zary and Jakob Pelletier should be done their development path and given every opportunity in scoring roles at the NHL level. Matt Coronato may start in the AHL, but he looks close as well after a spectacular NCAA career with Harvard and a strong World Championship with Team USA. Honzek\u2019s selection adds to this crop of forwards. Jeremie Poirier had a spectacular rookie campaign in the AHL producing well beyond expectations from the blue line. He\u2019ll get looks this year for the Flames if he doesn\u2019t make the team out of camp with the towering Yan Kuznetsov close behind at the AHL ranks, and Etienne Morin showing promise in the QMJHL. Dustin Wolf is the top goaltending prospect in the system and should be given more starts in the NHL this year.\n\n21. Ottawa Senators\n\nTop three prospects: Ridly Greig, Zack Ostapchuk, Tyler Boucher\n\nTop pick in 2023: Hoyt Stanley (108th overall)\n\nOttawa has an abundance of youth in the NHL, so there\u2019s no reason to panic that they\u2019re sitting this low, and they still have a handful of meaningful prospects on the way. This should be the season we see 2020 first round pick Ridly Greig begin his full-time NHL career after he got into 20 games last season as a rookie. Other players who could be in contention for a spot up front include Zack Ostapchuk, Tyler Boucher, and Roby Jarventie, with Boucher being of special interest as the 10th overall pick in 2021. It\u2019s time for Jacob Bernard-Docker and Lassi Thompson to claim full time spots, but they\u2019ll be battling with another rookie, Tyler Kleven, who made his NHL debut at the end of last season after ending his NCAA career. Tomas Hamara remains a top prospect despite a step backward last season in the OHL. Their top goaltending prospect is Leevi Merilainen.\n\n20. Toronto Maple Leafs\n\nTop three prospects: Matthew Knies, Topi Niemela, Nick Robertson\n\nTop pick in 2023: Easton Cowan (28th overall)\n\nKnies will be counted on to step in right away. He showed he was ready in the playoffs, although Toronto may be wise to also give him some top line starts in the AHL if their depth pushes him into a fourth line role. This season will be the year we know if Rodion Amirov\u2019s recovery from cancer will include a future with the Maple Leafs as he\u2019s set to suit up for his first full campaign in the KHL. Up front, it seems to be yet another make-or-break year for Nick Robertson as well, who has slid from blue-chipper to expendable. Up front, the development of Fraser Minten, Ty Voit, Nicholas Moldenhauer and Roni Hirvonen continues to trend in the right direction, while Easton Cowan, who was a shocking first round selection, will be under a microscope. On the blue line, Topi Niemela is the organization\u2019s top prospect and will play his first full season in North America, while William Villeneuve was a pleasant surprise for the Toronto Marlies last year. The Leafs remain without a true goalie of the future in the system unless Dennis Hildeby can claim that moniker this year.\n\n19. Washington Capitals\n\nTop three prospects: Ivan Miroshnichenko, Hendrix Lapierre, Ryan Leonard\n\nTop pick in 2023: Ryan Leonard (8th overall)\n\nAs Washington\u2019s contending era ends, youth will be infused to the roster. Hendrix Lapierre had a good first full pro season, and could crack the roster next year. A wild card from the time he was picked, Ivan Miroshnichenko continues to look like his comeback story could be a success. It\u2019s a good one-two punch, backed by the selection of Ryan Leonard and Andrew Cristall up front this season. On the back end, Ryan Chesley and Vincent Iorio are the two players to watch.\n\n18. Dallas Stars\n\nTop three prospects: Logan Stankoven, Mavrik Bourque, Lian Bichsel\n\nTop pick in 2023: Tristan Bertucci (61st overall)\n\nWhether it was at the World Juniors or with the Kamloops Blazers in the WHL, Logan Stankoven was just too good for the competition. Dallas may let him learn the defensive side a bit more in the AHL, but much like Wyatt Johnson, it\u2019s likely Stankoven can step in and contribute immediately. In his first season of professional hockey playing with Texas in the AHL, Mavrik Bourque showed he can do it at a higher level. He was good in the QMJHL, but he put together a 20-goal season as a pro rookie, and that bodes well for the future. Francesco Arcuri and Antonio Stranges round out the excitement up front. While he\u2019s far less exciting, Lian Bichsel is not less effective. The six-foot-five blueliner will make his North American debut next season.

O'Reilly seems like solid value, while Schenn's three-year contract is lengthy for a player who turns 34 later this year and possesses limited speed. Getting off of half of Johansen's deal was probably the best Nashville could do. Buying out Duchene seems odd when he might've had more value than Johansen and a similar deal may have been available.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\n\nNone of the big moves are awful in a vacuum, but the end result is the Predators got far slower and less dangerous offensively, even with the addition of middle-six winger Gustav Nyquist.\n\nFilip Forsberg (9) and Roman Josi (59) will have to do some heavy lifting for the Predators next season. (Photo by Danny Murphy/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nThe rationale for the moves also strains credulity, particularly with Schenn. Explaining his signing of the defenseman, Trotz told the following story from the 2019-20 playoff series between the New York Islanders and the Tampa Bay Lightning, when he was New York's coach:\n\n\"I thought we were starting to take the series over in the bubble. We were the physical team. We were the team that had that identity where we were getting under Tampa's skin. We were pushing some of the key guys maybe out of the series and getting momentum, and Luke was a guy that recognized that and, to me, changed the whole series. He came over and established a presence. He has a great way to identify those moments.\"\n\nThe problem with that story is the Islanders were never taking over the series, which they started 0-2 and never led. New York got as close as 2-1, but lost Game 4 by a commanding 4-1 margin.\n\nSchenn had literally the least per-game ice time of any player that appeared for the Lightning (10:53) in the six-game series. It would be unfair to say he had no effect, but the claim that he changed the series feels like a stretch.\n\nAs is the implication that a driving force behind his signing was a six-game stretch he played three years ago when he was 30.\n\nOn the subject of age, Trotz indicated that Johansen and Duchene didn't fit the team's window but that O'Reilly and Schenn did, which is confusing considering the new guys are older.\n\nNot all of Trotz's comments can be taken as precise indications of his entire thought process, but it seems clear the Predators are going all-in on intangibles and it's unclear where that's going to leave them \u2014 particularly offensively.\n\nO'Reilly projects to be the Predators' top-line centre and he's coming off an age-32 season that saw him produce 0.57 points per game. Not one player on the current roster produced 20 goals last season. Filip Forsberg is likely in for a bounce-back campaign \u2014 and there are some younger players who could step up like Luke Evangelista and Cody Glass \u2014 but this was the 27th-ranked offence in the NHL in 2022-23. Without Duchene and Johansen, it got less explosive.\n\nStory continues\n\nNone of this would be much of an issue if the Predators were in the midst of a genuine rebuild, but that's not where they're at. Juuse Saros could fetch a massive haul on the trade market, but there have been no rumblings of the star goaltender going anywhere in the last two years of his contract.\n\nRoman Josi remains one of the NHL's top defenseman, but he's 33. With a no-movement clause in hand he doesn't seem to be going anywhere, which means there's pressure to win while he's around. The team traded for 34-year-old defensive stalwart Ryan McDonaugh just over a year ago. This isn't a teardown job.\n\nBased on how the Predators are behaving, they ought to be judged on their ability to win now. Unless Saros plays out of his mind, it's hard to see that happening in 2023-24. O'Reilly and Schenn aren't bad players, but it's tough to envision them moving the needle in a profound way \u2014 and they seem to have been targeted for reasons only tangentially connected to on-ice success.\n\nAfter all, having that pair of \"serial winners\" around didn't catapult the Toronto Maple Leafs to a championship in 2022-23, even if they'd both hoisted the Cup before.\n\nRight now it seems like the plan in Nashville is to cultivate a constructive atmosphere to bring young players along over time while doing some winning along the way. The Predators may achieve the first goal in part due to their new signings, but the second one could be out of their reach.\n\nWith at least $8.805 million in dead money on their cap in each of the next three years \u2014 largely due to the Johansen and Duchene moves \u2014 it's not going to be easy for Trotz to maximize the Josi-Saros window, no matter how many \"winners\" he gets.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1151, "llama_token_count": 1353}, {"source_name": "Detroit Free Press", "author": "Detroit Free Press", "title": "Detroit Red Wings' pursuit of Alex DeBrincat isn't a magic fix.

Only 12 teams have longer odds to win the Cup according to BetMGM, and of that group only the Winnipeg Jets appeared in the 2022-23 postseason.\n\nSince Lou Lamoriello took the reigns on Long Island, the team has a respectable .582 points percentage (16th in the NHL) with six series victories. That's not a bad record, but there's a difference between making some noise in the playoffs and winning it all.\n\nIlya Sorokin's elite production has the potential to uplift the Islanders for years to come. (Dennis DaSilva /NHLI via Getty Images)\n\nHere's a look at the state of New York's Stanley Cup drought:\n\nHow long has it been?\n\nThe Islanders have not won the Stanley Cup in 39 seasons.\n\nHow close have the Islanders come?\n\nFairly close, in a sense.\n\nThe year after the Islanders won their last championship (1982-83), they made it back to the Stanley Cup Final again. That series was not particularly close, though, as the Edmonton Oilers defeated New York in five games, outscoring the Islanders 21-12.\n\nNew York had swept the Oilers in the final the previous season, holding Wayne Gretzky to just four assists in the series \u2014 but The Great One and Co. got loose in 1983-84 and it'd be hard to claim that the Islanders were particularly close to winning it all.\n\nEven if they'd earned a championship that season, they'd still be in the exact same place in this series on Stanley Cup droughts, the only difference would be the number of seasons reading 38, not 39.\n\nAlthough New York was able to hold onto the biggest stars from its four-peat between 1979-80 and 1982-83, for the rest of the decade that core slowly weakened. Mike Bossy's career came to a premature end due to injuries, Father Time diminished Billy Smith's effectiveness between the pipes, Bryan Trottier's scoring output declined in his late 20s and early 30s, and Dennis Potvin's days of grabbing Norris Trophy votes wound down.\n\nThe premature end of Mike Bossy's career helped close the Islanders' championship window. (Focus on Sport/Getty Images)\n\nFrom 1984-85 to 1989-90, the team that had dominated the early 80s went 212-212-56 and won just two playoff series. After that era came to an end, the Islanders spent plenty of time in the NHL's cellar, making the playoffs just twice between 1990-91 and 2000-01.\n\nIn the 21st century, the closest calls for New York came during the 2019-20 and 2020-21, seasons as they fell to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Eastern Conference finals on both occasions. They took they first series to six games and the second to seven \u2014 losing 1-0 in Game 7 in 2020-21.\n\nThe 2020-21 loss has to be especially tough to swallow as the winner of that series got to play a Montreal Canadiens club that had put together a 24-21-11 record during the regular season and just snuck into the playoffs.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne more win against the Lightning and the Islanders would've had a shot at a beatable opponent in a series between underdogs on unexpected runs.\n\nHow does New York's championship prognosis look now?\n\nOK.\n\nThe Islanders have built themselves a solid team whose success is largely predicated on players in their mid-to-late 20s who project to be useful for years to come. The team has extended much of its core, which means as the years go by many of the contracts on its books will look better and better, while rivals will have to re-up stars on more lucrative deals.\n\nNew York's blue line includes players like Noah Dobson and Alexander Romanov, whose arrows are pointing up, and the addition of Bo Horvat gives the team more offensive punch than it's had in recent seasons.\n\nThe Islanders' floor is also solid thanks to the presence of elite goaltender Ilya Sorokin, who will be in town through 2031-32. As long as the rock-solid Russian owns the crease, this club has a chance to punch above its weight and make a surprising playoff run or two.\n\nFor all those positives, the Islanders have a lack of star power that has them outgunned in matchups with the NHL's best teams. Mathew Barzal is an excellent player, but he never became the consistent game breaker it looked like he'd be following his dynamite Calder Trophy winning season. His contract is player-friendly and continues through 2030-31.\n\nThe presence of Horvat helps, but as it stands, this team is more of a collection of good players than a squad that needs to be considered an inner-circle contender. That doesn't seem likely to change for the foreseeable future, either, as the team's prospect pool isn't very well-regarded \u2014 and its high level of competence should prevent high picks from coming its way.\n\nNew York looks like a team destined to hover around in the middle of the pack unless a surprising prospect or two breaks through or the front office manages to successfully star chase with, like the Vegas Golden Knights have done in recent seasons.\n\nThe Islanders should be able to avoid the type of misery that dogged them through much of the 1990s, but it's tough to see their path to a title at the moment.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1328, "llama_token_count": 1652}, {"source_name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "author": "Associated Press", "title": "Short contracts and bonus money prove to be popular in NHL free agency this year", "description": "Max Pacioretty was in a unique, if not uncomfortable spot going into NHL free agency coming off tearing his right Achilles tendon twice in the past year.

Of the 166 NHL unrestricted free agent contracts signed Saturday, 68 were one- or two-year deals. The Boston Bruins, New York Rangers and Edmonton Oilers were also among the teams to hand out contracts with bonus incentives.\n\nNew York signed veteran winger Blake Wheeler, fresh off his buyout in Winnipeg, to an $800,000 contract with $300,000 more in bonuses and two-time Stanley Cup-winning goaltender Jonathan Quick, fresh off backing up for Vegas on its title run, to an $825,000 contract with $100,000 more in bonuses.\n\nThat was certainly a plan going into the offseason for Rangers GM Chris Drury, who knew he'd be losing wingers Patrick Kane and Vladimir Tarasenko in free agency because of his team's cap picture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou create your lists and get guys in order and start doing your homework,\u201d Drury said Saturday. \u201cI think everyone in this business \u2014 agents and players alike \u2014 are aware of the limited cap space we do have and did have.\u201d\n\nThat's a big club that includes everyone from the 2020 and '21 champion Tampa Bay Lightning to the Boston Bruins, coming off setting NHL records for wins and points in a regular season and losing in the first round of the playoffs.\n\n\u201cThe flat cap is difficult for all 32 GMs,\u201d Lightning GM Julien BriseBois said. \u201cIt\u2019s not tougher for me than it is for them.\u201d\n\nBriseBois was sad to see big winger Alex Killorn leave for a lucrative deal in Anaheim and Ian Cole sign in Vancouver, but he added versatile winger Conor Sheary for three years, defensive center Luke Glendening for two and depth forward Josh Archibald and defenseman Calvin de Haan for next season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lightning also traded three-time Cup winner Patrick Maroon and fellow forward Max Cajkovic to Minnesota for a 2024 seventh-round pick. Tampa Bay retained 20% of Maroon's $1 million salary, which clears enough space to sign a player at the league minimum of $775,000 \u2014 perhaps with bonuses.\n\nThe Bruins similarly said goodbye to winger Tyler Bertuzzi and Garnet Hathaway and defenseman Dmitry Orlov: their three trade deadline acquisitions who helped them break the records. Boston, among several bargain contracts, brought back 2011 Cup winner Milan Lucic \u2014 on a bonus-heavy deal paying him $1 million with $500,000 in incentives.\n\nBertuzzi joined the one-year-contract trend, signing for $5.5 million with Toronto for next season.\n\nWith seasoned GM Ken Holland heading into likely his final season on the job and aiming to win right now, Edmonton was even more creative in signing winger Connor Brown, who's coming off tearing the ACL in his right knee. Brown's one-year contract is for $775,000 with $3.225 million in potential bonuses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's how contenders need to operate in navigating a flat cap world.

That made short contracts - many with performance bonuses like Pacioretty\u2019s with the Washington Capitals - a popular route for players and teams willing to take moderate risks and kick money down the road.\n\n\u201cWe had limited cap space, and we were trying to add certain elements to the team,\u201d Capitals general manager Brian MacLellan said Sunday. \u201cThat opportunity within the CBA to have a lower cap hit and carry over if those bonuses are achieved was appealing to us because we got him at a $2 million cap hit instead of a higher cap hit, which we might not have been able to afford.\u201d\n\nThey weren\u2019t alone. Of the 166 NHL unrestricted free agent contracts signed Saturday, 68 were one- or two-year deals. The Boston Bruins, New York Rangers and Edmonton Oilers were also among the teams to hand out contracts with bonus incentives.\n\nNew York signed veteran winger Blake Wheeler, fresh off his buyout in Winnipeg, to an $800,000 contract with $300,000 more in bonuses and two-time Stanley Cup-winning goaltender Jonathan Quick, fresh off backing up for Vegas on its title run, to an $825,000 contract with $100,000 more in bonuses.\n\nThat was certainly a plan going into the offseason for Rangers GM Chris Drury, who knew he\u2019d be losing wingers Patrick Kane and Vladimir Tarasenko in free agency because of his team\u2019s cap picture.\n\n\u201cYou create your lists and get guys in order and start doing your homework,\u201d Drury said Saturday. \u201cI think everyone in this business - agents and players alike - are aware of the limited cap space we do have and did have.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a big club that includes everyone from the 2020 and \u201921 champion Tampa Bay Lightning to the Boston Bruins, coming off setting NHL records for wins and points in a regular season and losing in the first round of the playoffs.\n\n\u201cThe flat cap is difficult for all 32 GMs,\u201d Lightning GM Julien BriseBois said. \u201cIt\u2019s not tougher for me than it is for them.\u201d\n\nBriseBois was sad to see big winger Alex Killorn leave for a lucrative deal in Anaheim and Ian Cole sign in Vancouver, but he added versatile winger Conor Sheary for three years, defensive center Luke Glendening for two and depth forward Josh Archibald and defenseman Calvin de Haan for next season.\n\nThe Bruins similarly said goodbye to winger Tyler Bertuzzi and Garnet Hathaway and defenseman Dmitry Orlov: their three trade deadline acquisitions who helped them break the records. Boston, among several bargain contracts, brought back 2011 Cup winner Milan Lucic - on a bonus-heavy deal paying him $1 million with $500,000 in incentives.\n\nBertuzzi joined the one-year-contract trend, signing for $5.5 million with Toronto for next season.\n\nWith seasoned GM Ken Holland heading into likely his final season on the job and aiming to win right now, Edmonton was even more creative in signing winger Connor Brown, who\u2019s coming off tearing the ACL in his right knee. Brown\u2019s one-year contract is for the league minimum of $775,000 with $3.225 million in potential bonuses.\n\nThat\u2019s how contenders need to operate in navigating a flat cap world.

Since Tavares joined the team in 2018-19, the Maple Leafs' power play ranks fourth in the NHL, scoring on 24.0% of its opportunities.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the last two seasons they've been even better, finishing first or second in the NHL in power-play efficiency during both campaigns and posting the two highest PP% marks in franchise history.\n\nThe Maple Leafs have all of the ingredients for a top-notch power play, but the unit may have a different flavour in 2023-24. (Andr\u00e9 Ringuette/NHLI via Getty Images)\n\nThat record doesn't suggest the Maple Leafs need to overhaul what they do with the man advantage, but it looks like a mini shakeup is coming their way \u2014 for better or worse.\n\nThe new sheriff in town\n\nWhile the Maple Leafs retained bench boss Sheldon Keefe, the assistant coach most responsible for the team's elite power play over the last two years \u2014 Spencer Carbery \u2014 has moved on to Washington. While Carbery had excellent ingredients to work with, Toronto's best special teams unit was spectacular under his watch.\n\nOn Thursday, the Maple Leafs announced Carbery's replacement, Guy Boucher.\n\nThe 51-year-old former coach of the Ottawa Senators and Tampa Bay Lightning held down an NHL coaching role for six seasons. Here's how his teams fared on the power play in those years, with their 5-on-5 goal ranking to give a sense of the offensive talent on the squads in question:\n\nVia NHL.com\n\nThere are plenty of variables at play here, including the assistants under Boucher during his two head-coaching stints. That said, there isn't much evidence to suggest the newest member of Toronto's staff can elevate the success of power-play units above their expected output.\n\nBecause the Maple Leafs were so successful under Carbery, hiring an upgrade always seemed more or less out of the question. Boucher's track record doesn't suggest he's the guy to find another level for this already-elite unit.\n\nFrom a stylistic standpoint, one thing that stands out about the power plays that Boucher presided over in the past is that they tended to have a scoring focal point.\n\nDuring his three years in Tampa Bay, Steven Stamkos scored almost twice as many power-play goals (39) as the team's second-best power-play scorer, Vincent Lecavalier (22). The same was true in Ottawa with Mike Hoffman (21) easily topping Matt Duchene (13) as the top threat.\n\nUnder Carbery's guidance over the last two years, Matthews (29) and Tavares (28) have shared the scoring load with Nylander not too far behind (22). With Boucher in the mix it's possible the Maple Leafs try to funnel a higher percentage of the looks to Matthews.\n\nAlthough Rielly is a competent power-play quarterback \u2014 and the Maple Leafs know that he works well alongside their top four forwards \u2014 there's an argument to be made for installing Klingberg as the sole defenceman on their first unit.\n\nStory continues\n\nMuch of what makes Rielly effective as an offensive player is his ability to join the rush, a willingness to carry the puck to dangerous areas, and an accurate wrist shot. Those are good qualities, but they aren't always applicable as a power-play point man, which often leaves Rielly as a pure facilitator.\n\nKlingberg offers a bit more of a threat from the point as he carries a heavier shot than Rielly. His career shooting percentage (6.6%) is significantly better than Rielly's (4.7%), and he's scored eight more goals than the longtime Maple Leaf in 98 fewer games.\n\nThe veteran Swede is also more potent from long range as he has almost four times as many slap-shot goals in his career (15) than Rielly (4), who almost never lights the lamp on plays like this:\n\nJohn Klingberg winds up and cranks the slap shot past Allen, restoring Anaheim's lead in the third!#FlyTogether pic.twitter.com/TYpx7QpK4F \u2014 Hockey Daily 365 l NHL Highlights (@HockeyDaily365) December 16, 2022\n\nThat's not the type of shot the Maple Leafs power play should be built around, but it's something that teams have to account for when Klingberg is on the ice. Because Tavares is one of the best puck deflectors in the NHL, having a defenceman who is more of a threat to shoot from the point could have its advantages.\n\nComparing Klingberg and Rielly, it's clear the former has been more dynamic on a per-60 basis over the course of his career.\n\nVia NHL.com\n\nDespite those numbers, there's still a strong case to be made for Rielly. It's possible the Maple Leafs are best served by a defenceman who plays a supporting role on the power play and lets the forwards dominate the puck.\n\nKlingberg would bring a different element, but it remains to be seen if it's an element this group needs.\n\nThe new forwards\n\nWhile the forwards on the team's top unit may seem locked in, the team's willingness to experiment with Ryan O'Reilly on PP1 last season showed that mixing things up isn't out of the question.\n\nTyler Bertuzzi was a power-play force in his playoff cameo with the Boston Bruins and Max Domi got 36.7% of his points with the man advantage in a featured offensive role with the Chicago Blackhawks last season.\n\nIt will be tough for either forward to break through unless the team needs a shakeup because what each does best could be considered redundant with a higher-profile Maple Leaf. Bertuzzi is an excellent netfront presence, but it'd be hard to argue that he's better than Tavares. Domi is an underrated setup man, but he's no Marner.\n\nBertuzzi is more likely to break through if the Maple Leafs deploy Tavares in more of a bumper role with Matthews and Marner on the sides and a defenceman at the point. That could give the new Maple Leaf a chance to do his thing in front of the net and bump Nylander down to PP2. In a world where Nylander gets traded, that's also the most logical configuration.\n\nEven if the Maple Leafs go with a Core Four plus Rielly/Klingberg as the first unit, Bertuzzi and Domi figure to anchor the second group. Last season the players outside of Matthews, Marner, Nylander and Tavares who got the most power-play time were Michael Bunting, Rasmus Sandin, Calle Jarnkrok, Alexander Kerfoot and Pierre Engvall. Only Jarnkrok remains with the team.\n\nWhile upgrading on 2022-23's PP1 would be tough to do, PP2 is shaping up to be more potent. The Maple Leafs will be able to feature Bertuzzi, Domi, whichever defenceman isn't on the first unit and some combination of Jarnkrok, Matthew Knies and Nick Robertson.\n\nHowever that group shakes out, it has some potential \u2014 thanks in large part to Bertuzzi and Domi.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1597, "llama_token_count": 2001}, {"source_name": "Tennessean", "author": "The Tennessean", "title": "Explaining Nashville Predators' free-agent signings \u2013 and what Barry Trotz said about them", "description": "What Nashville Predators GM Barry Trotz had to say about Ryan O'Reilly, Luke Schenn and Gustav Nyquist, a breakdown of the deals and their roles", "url": "https://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/nhl/predators/2023/07/01/barry-trotz-nashville-predators-nhl-free-agent-signings-ryan-oreilly-luke-schenn-gustav-nyquist/70376119007/", "text": "Your subscription supports:\n\nImpactful insider coverage of Nashville politics that keeps the government in check.\n\nJournalism that makes our home better by celebrating the good, solving the bad, and investigating the ugly.\n\nMusic city coverage and what it means for Nashvillians (transplants and unicorns alike).

He helped the Tampa Bay Lightning win the Cup back to back in 2020 and '21 and reach the final in 2022, playing a key role during each run.\n\nKillorn also turns 34 before opening night and plays a heavy style of game. Still, he's a proven winner, much like former teammate Ondrej Palat, who cashed in last summer with a $30 million, five-year contract.\n\nJ.T. COMPHER\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Avalanche would love to bring back Compher, a versatile 28-year-old forward who can play center and wing and is coming off a career year with 52 points. They have some extra cap space to use because captain Gabriel Landeskog will likely spend the entire season on long-term injured reserve following knee cartilage replacement surgery.\n\nPlus, Colorado traded restricted free agent forward Alex Newhook to Montreal on Tuesday, so perhaps there is a road back for Compher. If not, he'll be well compensated on the open market.\n\nPATRICK KANE\n\nThe second-most prolific scorer among U.S.-born players is the most accomplished star available. He has won the Cup three times with Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Kane is 34 and could miss several months recovering from hip resurfacing surgery, which only Washington's Nick Backstrom and one other player have come back from. Kane figures to be the perfect veteran addition for a growing team ready to take that next step.\n\nJONATHAN TOEWS\n\nA longtime teammate of Kane's in Chicago, Toews and the Blackhawks are parting ways after 15 seasons. Now 35, Toews could be a depth center helping a contending team chase a championship.\n\nPittsburgh could be a fit, if Toews and Sidney Crosby want to play together in the NHL after winning two Olympic gold medals together for Canada.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDEFENSEMEN\n\nDMITRY ORLOV\n\nAnother Cup winner (from the Capitals in 2018), Orlov made himself some real money with an impressive couple of months in Boston following a trade from Washington. After 19 points in 43 games with the Capitals, Orlov had 17 in 23 the remainder of the regular season with the Bruins.\n\nHe's soon to be 32, so he might not get the maximum eight-year deal. But it's not out of the realm of possibility to imagine $36 million for Orlov over six seasons.\n\nOLIVER EKMAN-LARSSON\n\nThe 31-year-old Swede wasn't supposed to be a free agent for four more summers. Then the Vancouver Canucks bought him out and put an intriguing player into the pool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEkman-Larsson has not been at his best in recent years, but the right opportunity could allow him to recapture some of his past success.\n\nGOALTENDERS\n\nFREDERIK ANDERSEN\n\nOn the verge of turning 33, Andersen has taken three different organizations to the playoffs over his lengthy career. He was good for Carolina this past spring, going 5-3 with a 1.83 goals-against average and .927 save percentage.\n\nAndersen could return to the Hurricanes, but they may be in the market for a change in net. Pyotr Kochetkov is 24 and the future. Andersen can still help a contender win.\n\nTRISTAN JARRY\n\nAn All-Star in 2022 with Pittsburgh, Jarry is just 28 and might still have the potential to be an above-average NHL starter. The Penguins are firmly in win-now mode with Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang under contract, so they might swing big for a goalie via trade.\n\nJarry is younger than Andersen and Antti Raanta and may be in line for a nice payday elsewhere.\n\n___\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "tiktoken_token_count": 1056, "llama_token_count": 1347}, {"source_name": "Nbcsportsboston.com", "author": "NBC Sports Boston", "title": "5 winners, losers from Round One of 2023 NHL Draft", "description": "The Chicago Blackhawks got their man in Connor Bedard, but did the Anaheim Ducks stumble?

But it has only made the playoffs six times and currently is in a three-year drought.\n\nFor a small-market team, getting high draft picks right is the healthiest way to climb up the standings. Fortunately for Columbus, Anaheim's decision to pass on Fantilli made the Blue Jackets' job much easier.\n\nFantilli, boasting a 6-foot-2, 195-pound frame, has immense physical strength that doesn't hinder his speed when skating around the ice. The Michigan product recorded 1.81 points per game as a freshman, the most by a draft-eligible player since Paul Kariya in 1992-93.\n\nHis output is already solid for his age, but considering his mechanics and shot angles could benefit from enhancing, Fantilli falling to the No. 3 overall pick was an unbelievably colossal win for the Blue Jackets.\n\nLoser: Trades\n\nGeneral managers on Wednesday didn't have much to do besides making selections.\n\nIn terms of draft-night trades, there were none.

However, he dropped to the Flyers at No. 7.\n\nThere were a couple of reasons for his slide that involved his availability to play in the NHL since he's currently under contract with KHL's SKA St. Petersburg in Russia through the 2025-26 season.\n\nBut the Flyers have a scout based in Russia, Ken Hoodikoff, who has watched prospects there in person, per NBC Sports Philadelphia. So landing a talent like Michkov, even though it's not transparent when and if he'll able to transition to the NHL, at No. 7 has the potential to be a crucial win in the long run.", "tiktoken_token_count": 902, "llama_token_count": 1131}, {"source_name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "author": "Yahoo Sports Canada", "title": "Maple Leafs aren't Stanley Cup favourites, whatever the odds say", "description": "The Toronto Maple Leafs are a perfect case study in the difference between odds and probabilities.", "url": "https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/maple-leafs-arent-stanley-cup-favourites-whatever-the-odds-say-172812299.html", "text": "Over the next few weeks, you're going to see a few headlines telling you the Toronto Maple Leafs are the Stanley Cup favourites for 2023-24.\n\nDon't believe them.\n\nTo be clear, there is nothing wrong with reporting on the fact that the Maple Leafs have some of the shortest odds in the NHL at most sportsbooks, and favourite status at a few. That's not inaccurate, or even inherently disingenuous.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhere it's easy for wires to cross is the way we are conditioned to take the term 'favourite' and associate it with 'best team' or 'team most likely to win' \u2014 and that's not always the case. Sportsbooks set lines with probabilities in mind, sure, but that's not all that's going on.\n\nIf they made the Arizona Coyotes the favourite to win the Stanley Cup, no one would bet on them so it would be a waste of time. If they offered the Colorado Avalanche as a +300,000 underdog to win it all, they'd put themselves in the position to lose buckets of money on an outcome that could easily come to pass.\n\nThat said, the goal of a sportsbook is to induce as much betting as it can without over-leveraging itself on a particular outcome. It is not designed to tell the future.\n\nThe Maple Leafs are a good team, but they are plenty of squads with a better chance to win the Stanley Cup. (Matt Carlson/Getty Images)\n\nSo, when the Maple Leafs appear as a Stanley Cup favourite, it's because sportsbooks know they don't have to offer value in line with the team's chances of winning to receive plenty of bets.\n\nToronto has a massive fanbase, some of whom will want to bet on the team to win it all no matter what. This trend is heightened by the fact the team hasn't won a Cup since 1967. Holding a ticket on the team's drought-breaking season could be an appealing prospect for some.\n\nIt's also no secret that the Maple Leafs receive a disproportionate amount of media coverage.\n\nThe combination of the large audience for content around the team \u2014 and the fact that Canadian sports media outlets tend to be headquartered in Toronto \u2014 often makes the club top of mind for NHL fans, whether they like it or not. That level of visibility probably also attracts some betting action.\n\nNow, for the Maple Leafs to get favourite status, they still have to be plausible champions in 2023-24, and they certainly meet that threshold. Toronto tied the Vegas Golden Knights for the fourth-highest point total in the 2022-23 regular season with 111. The year before, the team ranked fourth with 115.\n\nToronto also finally got over the hump in the playoffs, defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round. You could make an argument that they improved the roster by adding Tyler Bertuzzi, Max Domi, and John Klingberg on prove-it one-year contracts.\n\nDespite that, there are a few teams that simply have to be considered more likely to win a championship than Toronto in 2023-24.\n\nThe Golden Knights matched Toronto's regular season and just won it all. They were surprisingly able to bring back Ivan Barbashev and Adin Hill, leaving Rielly Smith as the team's only major departure.\n\nThe Carolina Hurricanes won more games than the Maple Leafs during the 2022-23 season, and advanced further in the playoffs. Their free-agent shopping spree included adding the top defenceman on the market \u2014 Dmitry Orlov \u2014 and former Maple Leaf Michael Bunting. They look like they are nearing a deal for Vladimir Taransenko and may still be in the market to trade for Erik Karlsson.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe New Jersey Devils had a better point total than Toronto, and went just as far in the playoffs. Much of the team's young core is improving and they locked in Jesper Bratt and Timo Meier on big extensions, while acquiring Tyler Toffoli via trade. It would be hard to argue Toronto is better than New Jersey.\n\nColorado also deserve a mention on a list of teams that clearly have a better shot than Toronto. The team made some excellent moves prior to free agency, added some depth in the open market, and should have plenty of cap room for additional upgrades if they put Gabriel Landeskog's $7 million cap hit on LTIR.\n\nThose cases don't seem particularly debatable, and depending on how you evaluate clubs like the Edmonton Oilers, Dallas Stars, or Boston Bruins, projecting them to have a better chance to win than Toronto is reasonable. Impassioned arguments could conceivably be made for a few other squads, too.\n\nThe Maple Leafs are a really good hockey team with a real chance to win the Stanley Cup in 2023-24 \u2014 just like they've had a legitimate shot the last few years. Even so, being the best squad in a 32-team league is a tall order, and Toronto does not meet that criteria at the moment.\n\nThe favourite label is a mechanism designed to divert bets in the direction that sportsbooks want it to go, at values that they are comfortable with. It does not indicate who will win.

The team's hopes that changing its core on the fly would allow it to maintain its momentum were dashed, and a Flames franchise that looked like it could threaten for a Cup just over a year ago entered a state of flux.\n\nIt's been more than three decades since Calgary earned its last championship, and it's tough to see the path to its next one.\n\nHere's a look at the state of Calgary's Stanley Cup drought:\n\nJonathan Huberdeau is hoping to bounce back after a subpar 2022-23 (Derek Cain/Getty Images)\n\nHow long has it been?\n\nThe Flames have not won the Stanley Cup in 33 seasons.\n\nHow close have the Flames come?\n\nWithin one goal.\n\nCalgary took on the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 2003-04 Stanley Cup Final and lost Game 7 by a score of 2-1. It also lost Game 6 in double overtime after taking a 3-2 series lead.\n\nThat Game 6 included a play with less than 7 minutes remaining in the game that may have gone in off the skate of Martin Gelinas, but was ruled no goal \u2014 a play that remains controversial to this day. In other words, the Flames couldn't have gotten closer to a Cup win without earning a title.\n\nNot only was that an unfortunate outcome for the Calgary, the 2003-04 squad was a bit of a singular group. The Flames hadn't made the playoffs for seven years prior to that season and the 2004-05 NHL lockout prevented them from running it back right away.\n\nCalgary lost in the first round for four consecutive seasons following the lockout and failed to successfully build around Jarome Iginla during the tail end of his prime.\n\nThe Flames only got close to winning the Stanley Cup once during the Jarome Iginla era. (Brad Watson/NHLI via Getty Images)\n\nFor most of the 33 years Calgary has failed to earn a title, the team has been competent, but not spectacular. The Flames rank 12th in the NHL in points (2,792) since their last title in 1988-89, but have just six playoff series wins during that time \u2014 one of which was a best-of-five victory during a 2019-20 season derailed by COVID-19.\n\nLosing in the first round has been the norm for the franchise, as they've done so 12 times since earning their last championship. It's not as if the Flames have iced regular-season juggernauts that have found ways to disappoint in the playoffs, either.\n\nCalgary have produced just three squads that have topped 100 points in a season since 1989. Their best regular-season team was the 2021-22 group (111 points) that got disassembled the following offseason.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat state of continually bowing out early in the playoffs and often being expected to do so means that the Flames have fewer what-if moments than a number of clubs facing similar Cup droughts.\n\nThe one they do have is tough to stomach, though.\n\nHow does Calgary's championship prognosis look now?\n\nNot great.\n\nIf you're looking to feel optimistic about the Flames, you could say that the team posted excellent underlying numbers in 2022-23 despite missing the playoffs. Only one team had a larger share of shots on net at 5-on-5 than Calgary last season, and just two had a higher percentage of expected goals.\n\nFiring Darryl Sutter seems like a step in the right direction if the number of players who reportedly rescinded trade requests as a result is any indication.\n\nIf Jacob Markstr\u00f6m can rebound from a difficult season between the pipes and Calgary gets more shooting luck, they're not far from being a successful team.\n\nAll of that said, the Flames also traded leading scorer Tyler Toffoli for a winger in Yegor Sharangovich who is coming off an uninspiring campaign and seems unlikely to replicate Toffoli's production.\n\nThe team also has a massive group of players who could become unrestricted free agents after 2023-24 that includes Elias Lindholm, Mikael Backlund, Noah Hanifin, Chris Tanev, and Nikita Zadorov. It would surprise no one if a number of those players were moved in the lead up to the season.\n\nEven if they all stay, and many depart after 2023-24, Calgary could be looking at a reset. There is a theoretical version of the Flames that could be good this year, but it's tough to see that coming about \u2014 and even if everything breaks right, they'd project to be more solid than spectacular.\n\nThat means this drought doesn't look like it'll come to an end in the immediate future, and the longer-term prognosis for this franchise is tough to pin down.\n\nIts prospect pool isn't particularly well-regarded, but if the team does end up holding a mini veteran fire sale, it has a chance to build a bigger stash of young players and picks than it has today.\n\nCalgary seems to be an extremely successful rebuild away from threatening to win a Stanley Cup, but that rebuild hasn't really started yet \u2014 and may be tough to execute around Huberdeau and Kadri.\n\nIf the Flames opt for more of a retool, it will be very difficult to find their out from the middle of the pack, a spot they've become all-too-familiar with over the years.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1349, "llama_token_count": 1675}, {"source_name": "SNY.tv", "author": "SNY", "title": "Rangers 2023 free agency preview: Breaking down the Blueshirts\u2019 internal and external options", "description": "With free agency kicking off this weekend, let's take a look at some internal and external options for the Rangers to consider...", "url": "https://sny.tv/articles/rangers-2023-free-agency-preview-internal-external-options", "text": "Owned and operated by SportsNet New York, part of the SNY Blog Network.

He produces a respectable amount of offense, moves the puck effectively, throws his 5-foot-11, 214-pound frame around, posts solid possession stats and skates 22 minutes per night.\n\nHe's on the wrong side of 30, but he showed no signs of slowing down last year and defensemen of his size often age gracefully as their physicality doesn't fade. Top-pair defenders are hard to come by and Orlov fits that description.\n\nUpdate: Orlov signed a two-year, $15.5 million contract with the Hurricanes.\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 28\n\nPosition: LW\n\n2022-23 team: Detroit Red Wings/Boston Bruins\n\n2022-23 stats: 50 GP, 8 G, 22 A, 30 P, 52.5% CF\n\nSummary: Bertuzzi's regular-season numbers don't jump off the page, but he was a 30-goal scorer in 2021-22 and his 10-point tour de force in the first round of the playoffs will be in every GM's mind when they approach his agent.\n\nIt's hard to find a top-line calibre player under the age of 30 in free agency and Bertuzzi is capable of getting on the scoresheet and under his opponents' skin. He's no Matthew Tkachuk, but you can see shades of the Florida Panthers superstar in his ability to get physical and fill the net.\n\nUpdate: Bertuzzi signed a one-year, $5.5 million contract with the Maple Leafs.\n\n3. Ryan O'Reilly\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 32\n\nPosition: C\n\n2022-23 team(s): St. Louis Blues/Toronto Maple Leafs\n\n2022-23 stats: 53 GP, 16 G, 14 A, 30 P, 49.6% CF\n\nSummary: O'Reilly's 2022-23 did not go as planned due to injury issues, but he remains a strong two-way center capable of thriving in a second-line role. He produced 20 points in 24 games after joining Toronto last season, and added another nine points in 11 playoff games.\n\nIf you're interested in intangibles, O'Reilly has you covered as a former captain with extensive playoff experience. His trophy case includes a Conn Smythe Trophy, Selke Trophy and Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. He's no longer at the height of his powers, but he's not far off.\n\nUpdate: O'Reilly signed a four-year, $18-million contract with the Predators\n\nRyan O'Reilly is among the top NHL free agents available this summer.

Even so, it's tough to ignore that the star winger is just a year removed from a 92-point campaign and has a higher offensive ceiling than anyone else on this list.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's tough to gauge his chances of reaching that ceiling, but it's possible that he was on cruise control with a brutal Blackhawks team before struggling to get acclimated to life with the Rangers last year. A bounce-back season isn't out of the question in the right situation.\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 29\n\nPosition: RD\n\n2022-23 team: Minnesota Wild\n\n2022-23 stats: 79 GP, 4 G, 10 A, 14 P, 49.0% CF\n\nSummary: Dumba's stock isn't as high as it was when his offensive production was more consistent, but he still checks plenty of boxes for NHL teams. He's a right-shot defenseman under the age of 30 who can skate top-pair minutes, kill penalties and even fill in on the power play as needed.\n\nThe Wild have used him in more of a shutdown role in recent years, but another team may see a little more offensive upside in Dumba. While his goal totals have been in decline lately, he still flashes intriguing skill at times and a change of scenery might help him after spending years at the forefront of trade rumors.\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 27\n\nPosition: LW\n\n2022-23 team(s): St. Louis Blues/Vegas Golden Knights\n\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 16 G, 29 A, 45 P, 45.8% CF\n\nSummary: Like Bertuzzi, Barbashev stands to cash in on his work in the playoffs. The winger was productive on Jack Eichel's flank for the Golden Knights, making the case that he can be deployed as a first-line winger for a contender.\n\nBarbashev has youth and recent production on his side, plus a little size (6-1, 195) and a willingness to throw some hits. Getting the label of \"winning player\" will help his bottom line, as will the fact he'll make a better long-term investment than most of the guys available.\n\nUpdate: Barbashev signed a five-year, $25-million deal to remain with the Vegas Golden Knights.\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 34\n\nPosition: LW\n\n2022-23 team: Tampa Bay Lightning\n\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 27 G, 37 A, 64 P, 50.7% CF\n\nSummary: No available player produced more points than Killorn in 2022-23, who comes with plenty of playoff pedigree after winning two Stanley Cups with the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nHis age will justifiably scare off some suitors, but he's a versatile player who plays both special teams and does just about everything well. He's also missed just four games since 2015-16, suggesting durability should be less of an issue with him than it is for most players his age.\n\nUpdate: Killorn signed a four-year, $25 million deal with the Ducks.\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 32\n\nPosition: RW\n\n2022-23 team(s): St. Louis Blues/New York Rangers\n\n2022-23 stats: 69 GP, 18 G, 32 A, 50 P, 45.7% CF\n\nSummary: There are age and durability concerns with Tarasenko, but he remains a talented scorer capable of conjuring moments of brilliance.\n\nUpdate: Tarasenko signed a one-year, $5 million deal with the Senators.\n\nOh my, what a goal by Tarasenko pic.twitter.com/WqXC4hKihR \u2014 Habs Fan TV (@habsfantv_) March 3, 2023\n\nHe's also just one year removed from a 34-goal season and in the right situation he might be able to recapture that magic. Tarasenko probably needs a skilled pass-first linemate or two \u2014 and some power-play time \u2014 to reach his full potential, but he still looks like a capable trigger man.\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 28\n\nPosition: C/LW\n\n2022-23 team: Chicago Blackhawks/Dallas Stars\n\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 20 G, 36 A, 56 P, 45.0% CF\n\nSummary: Domi got a chance to thrive in a massive role with the lowly Blackhawks for most of 2022-23 before becoming a critical mid-season addition for the Stars.\n\nHe has plenty of role versatility, provides an offensive spark and possesses the kind of sandpaper to him that many GMs value. The way he's bounced around the NHL in recent years might be a red flag for some, but top-six quality players under 30 aren't easy to come by in free agency.\n\nUpdate: Domi signed a one-year, $3 million deal with the Maple Leafs.\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 28\n\nPosition: C\n\n2022-23 team: Colorado Avalanche\n\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 17 G, 35 A, 52 P, 51.3% CF\n\nSummary: Compher took on a huge role with the Avalanche in 2022-23, playing both special teams and skating 20:32 per night \u2014 the 14th-highest total among all forwards.\n\nThat doesn't make him a superstar, but a do-it-all second-line center who is a couple years from his 30th birthday is a valuable asset. The biggest concern with Compher is that he'd never produced 33 points in a season prior to 2022-23.\n\nTeams might be wary about paying for the player he was last season when he's spent most of his career producing at a middle-six level.\n\nUpdate: Compher signed a five-year, $25.5 million deal with the Red Wings\n\nMichael Bunting has scored 46 goals over the past two seasons. (Mark Blinch/Getty Images)\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 28\n\nPosition: LW\n\n2022-23 team: Toronto Maple Leafs\n\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 23 G, 26 A, 49 P, 51.9% CF\n\nSummary: Bunting is a tough player to put a price tag on. The winger is coming off two consecutive 23-goal seasons, but he's done a lot of his damage skating alongside Auston Matthews on Toronto's top line.\n\nIt's unclear what he can do in a smaller role or if he would be worth his price tag if he's not skating with top dogs. Despite the questions around him, he's relatively young and knows how to score. That combo is worth plenty to NHL teams.\n\nUpdate: Bunting signed a three-year, $13.5 million deal with the Hurricanes.\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 28\n\nPosition: G\n\n2022-23 team: Pittsburgh Penguins\n\n2022-23 stats: 47 GP, 2.90 GAA, .909 SV%, +7.4 GSAA\n\nSummary: Jarry is the best option for teams looking for a long-term solution in net. Over the last four years the 28-year-old has produced a .915 save percentage and +40.6 GSAA in a beefy 177-game sample.\n\nIn that time, his save percentage has never dropped below .909 in a single season. His playoff numbers aren't impressive, but he's played just eight postseason games. Jarry isn't an elite goaltender, but he's a steady option whoever acquires him can feel good about.\n\nUpdate: Jarry re-signs with Penguins on five-year, $26.875 million deal\n\n13. Adin Hill\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 27\n\nPosition: G\n\n2022-23 team: Vegas Golden Knights\n\n2022-23 stats: 27 GP, 2.45 GAA, .915 SV%, +8.0 GSAA\n\nSummary: Everyone values goaltenders differently, but we're willing to put Hill here on account of his incredible run in these playoffs.\n\nIf teams see what he's done for the Golden Knights as indicative of his future potential they should jump all over a 27-year-old who doesn't have enough of a track record to command a massive contract. Some clubs might see his recent run as less relevant to his future prospects and opt to steer clear.\n\nUpdate: Hill signed a two-year, $9.8-million contract extension to remain with the Golden Knights.\n\n14. Jason Zucker\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 31\n\nPosition: LW\n\n2022-23 team: Pittsburgh Penguins\n\n2022-23 stats: 78 GP, 27 G, 21 A, 48 P, 55.0% CF\n\nSummary: No free agent scored more goals in 2022-23 than Zucker, who has now scored at least 20 goals in six of the last nine seasons.\n\nAs a 12-year veteran who's still relatively young, Zucker has plenty of experience but should still have some good hockey left in him. The winger is a former King Clancy Memorial Trophy Winner who brings intangibles as well as goal scoring. He'd fit nicely on plenty of second lines around the NHL.\n\nUpdate: Zucker signed a one-year, $5.3 million deal with the Coyotes\n\n15. Ryan Graves\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 28\n\nPosition: LD\n\n2022-23 team: New Jersey Devils\n\n2022-23 stats: 78 GP, 8 G, 18 A, 26 P, 51.1% CF\n\nSummary: Graves is a meat-and-potatoes defenseman, but that's a feature not a bug. Although he isn't much of an offensive creator, he's a 6-foot-5, 220-pounder who ranked 20th in the NHL in shot blocking in 2022-23 despite playing for a team that dominated the possession game.\n\nGraves won't turn a franchise around, but he's got size, youth and defensive acumen on his side. He also occasionally shows some surprising offensive flair.\n\nRyan Graves brings the puck to the net and beats Stalock's poke to put the Devils up by 2 in the third!#NJDevils pic.twitter.com/652au0GBTt \u2014 Hockey Daily 365 l NHL Highlights (@HockeyDaily365) April 2, 2023\n\nUpdate: Graves signed a six-year, $27 million contract with the Penguins.\n\n16.

He's also relatively young for a free agent and just gave the Hurricanes some quality minutes in the playoffs.\n\nThat said, there's a reason Carolina was able to rent him for a 2026 third-round pick at the trade deadline and started his even-strength shifts in the offensive zone more than 60% of the time in the postseason. There are real defensive concerns here, and whoever picks up Gostisbehere needs to have a plan for how to deploy him.\n\nUpdate: Gostisbehere signed a one-year, $4.125 million deal with the Red Wings\n\n17. Scott Mayfield\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 30\n\nPosition: RD\n\n2022-23 team: New York Islanders\n\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 6 G, 18 A, 24 P, 48.0% CF\n\nSummary: Like Graves, Mayfield is a big, strong, defensive defenseman who's listed at 6-foot-5, 220 pounds. His right shot could make him especially appealing to certain teams.\n\nWe have him slightly below Graves because he's a couple of years older and offers a little less offensively, but Mayfield would be the perfect stay-at-home partner to an offensively imaginative defenseman. He logged 21:02 per game with the Islanders last year and started more than 60% of his even-strength shifts in the defensive zone.\n\nImagine the polar opposite of Gostisbehere, and that's essentially what Mayfield brings.\n\nUpdate: Mayfield signed a seven-year, $24.5 million contract with the Islanders.\n\n18. Tomas Tatar\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 32\n\nPosition: LW\n\n2022-23 team: New Jersey Devils\n\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 20 G, 28 A, 48 P, 57.3% CF\n\nSummary: Tatar is not an exciting name, but he's a possession-metric beast who puts up strong offensive numbers wherever he goes.\n\nThe Czech veteran is a middle-six player who can chip in on the power play if needed and provide solid secondary scoring numbers. His range of outcomes is relatively narrow, but anyone looking for a consistent producer is unlikely to be disappointed. The main concerns with Tatar are his age and the fact he doesn't bring any penalty-killing utility.\n\n19. John Klingberg\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 31\n\nPosition: RD\n\n2022-23 team(s): Anaheim Ducks/Minnesota Wild\n\n2022-23 stats: 67 GP, 10 G, 23 A, 33 P, 44.2% CF\n\nSummary: Klingberg's stock has fallen significantly since he came sixth in Norris Trophy voting twice (2015-16 and 2017-18), but he's still a valuable player. The Swede has skated at least 20 minutes per night in each of his nine NHL seasons, and he's never produced fewer than 32 points.\n\nOn the flip side, he doesn't really kill penalties, doesn't provide much of a physical presence and has posted average possession metrics in recent years. He could still run a power play in a pinch, but he's probably more of a fill-in than a top option for that role at this point.\n\nEven so, a right-shot defenseman with some offensive ability and a history of carrying heavy workloads should generate some interest.\n\nUpdate: Klingberg signed a one-year, $4.15 million deal with the Maple Leafs\n\n20. Frederik Andersen\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 33\n\nPosition: G\n\n2022-23 team: Carolina Hurricanes\n\n2022-23 stats: 34 GP, 2.48 GAA, .903 SV%, -0.7 GSAA\n\nSummary: Andersen is coming off a strong playoff run (.927 SV%) and during his last full season he posted a .922 save percentage. The Dane's tenure in Toronto ended poorly, but when he's healthy he's been remarkably consistent throughout his career.\n\nIt's not advisable for the 33-year-old to make 60-plus starts like he once did, but he's a good candidate to be a 1A goaltender with a competent backup. The only worry here is durability and whether playing behind the Hurricanes' excellent defense has juiced his numbers the last two seasons.\n\nUpdate: Andersen signed a two-year, $6.8 million contract to remain with the Hurricanes\n\n21. Erik Haula\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 32\n\nPosition: C/LW\n\n2022-23 team: New Jersey Devils\n\n2022-23 stats: 80 GP, 14 G, 27 A, 41 P, 53.9% CF\n\nSummary: There's nothing that Haula does extraordinarily well, but he's an extremely versatile forward who's a good fit as a third-line center or middle-six winger. He can kill penalties or jump on the power play if needed and he wins draws at an impressive clip.\n\nHaula has plenty of playoff experience and has received plaudits for the veteran leadership he brings. Coming off two straight seasons with more than 40 points, the market for the Finn should be robust.\n\nUpdate: Haula signed a three-year, $9.45 million deal to remain with the New Jersey Devils.\n\n22. Joonas Korpisalo\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 29\n\nPosition: G\n\n2022-23 team(s): Columbus Blue Jackets/Los Angeles Kings\n\n2022-23 stats: 34 GP, 2.87 GAA, .914 SV%, +11.5 GSAA\n\nSummary: Korpisalo is on the right side of 30 and coming off a strong season split between Columbus and Los Angeles. He also has a surprisingly strong playoff resume after leading the Blue Jackets to an upset win over the Maple Leafs in 2019-20 while setting the NHL record for saves in a playoff game (85) the following round against Tampa Bay.\n\nViewed through that lens he could be considered a candidate to start for years to come, but for most of his career he's produced like a backup with a career GSAA mark of -41.1. Korpisalo is the type of player who is open to interpretation.\n\nIf you think he turned a corner last year, he could have immense value. If you put more weight in his track record, steering clear is the best move.\n\nUpdate: Korpisalo signed a five-year, $20 million deal with the Senators.\n\n23. Semyon Varlamov\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 35\n\nPosition: G\n\n2022-23 team: New York Islanders\n\n2022-23 stats: 23 GP, 2.70 GAA, .913 SV%, +6.0 GSAA\n\nSummary: Varlamov doesn't have the ceiling of Korpisalo as a possible long-term solution, but he's reliable when healthy. The veteran has a .916 save percentage over his last six seasons without falling below .909 once. His GSAA in that time is +52.9, and he led the NHL in the metric as recently as 2020-21.\n\nAge and durability are the issues here. His games played have declined each season since 2017-18 and he hasn't topped 40 games in any of the last three seasons. You know what you're going to get from Varlamov when he's on the ice, but it's unclear how available he'll be.\n\nUpdate: Varlamov signed a four-year, $11 million contract to remain with the Islanders\n\n24. Luke Schenn\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 33\n\nPosition: RD\n\n2022-23 team(s): Vancouver Canucks/Toronto Maple Leafs\n\n2022-23 stats: 70 GP, 4 G, 18 A, 22 P, 45.2% CF\n\nSummary: If Schenn plays like he did for the Maple Leafs in the playoffs he'll be a heck of a pickup, but it's tough to count on that going forward. His lack of speed is an issue and there's a reason that he was available for less than $1 million last offseason.\n\nHis work in 2022-23 warrants a significant raise, but it's unclear if he can sustain a high level of play over the course of an entire season. As a two-time Stanley Cup winner who is among the NHL's most prolific hitters he will have plenty of fans among GMs, though.\n\nUpdate: Schenn signed a three-year, $8.25 million contract with the Predators.\n\n25. Alexander Kerfoot\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 29\n\nPosition: C/LW\n\n2022-23 team: Toronto Maple Leafs\n\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 10 G, 22 A, 32 P, 52.1% CF\n\nSummary: Kerfoot is just one year removed from a 51-point season and he's been a durable middle-six contributor capable of playing multiple roles for the Maple Leafs in recent years.\n\nWhile he's increased his value by becoming a skilled penalty killer in recent seasons, he's also been deployed at center less frequently. At this point his best role is probably as a third-line winger, but he's still not 30 and can provide a little offensive punch from that spot.\n\nUpdate: Kerfoot signed a two-year, $7 million deal with the Coyotes.\n\n26. Antti Raanta\n\nAnti Raanta has a career save percentage of .918. (Josh Lavallee/NHLI via Getty Images)\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 34\n\nPosition: G\n\n2022-23 team: Carolina Hurricanes\n\n2022-23 stats: 27 GP, 2.20 GAA, .910 SV%, +3.7 GSAA\n\nSummary: Raanta arguably played better than Andersen this season, but he doesn't have the same track record as a starter. The Finn has played more than 33 games just once in his career and Carolina seemed to prefer Andersen when both netminders were healthy.\n\nRaanta has strong career numbers, but he seems typecast in the 1B role and it's unlikely he'll get a chance to do more as he approaches his mid-30s. Despite his possible role limitations, the veteran has a solid body of work with a .920 save percentage since 2014-15. In that time he's never posted a GSAA worse than -1.4.\n\nUpdate: Raanta re-signed with the Hurricanes on a one-year, $1.5 million contract\n\n27. Max Pacioretty\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 34\n\nPosition: LW\n\n2022-23 team: Carolina Hurricanes\n\n2022-23 stats: 5 GP, 3 G, 0 A, 3 P, 65.1% CF\n\nSummary: Pacioretty is a total mystery box after playing just 44 games in the last two seasons due to injury issues. To his credit, he has 22 goals in those contests so his goal scoring touch may not have deserted him, but a guy his age coming off an Achilles injury is tough to trust.\n\nThe veteran would be a good fit for a contender that wouldn't rely on him to be an offensive force, but would welcome a boost in that area if he's able to provide it. Despite his recent injury troubles, only 10 players have scored more goals than Pacioretty since his first full season in 2011-12.\n\nUpdate: Pacioretty signed a one-year, $2 million deal with the Capitals.\n\n28. Pierre Engvall\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 27\n\nPosition: LW\n\n2022-23 team(s): Toronto Maple Leafs/New York Islanders\n\n2022-23 stats: 76 GP, 17 G, 13 A, 30 P, 53.6% CF\n\nSummary: Engvall's combination of size and speed has never resulted in the kind of production you'd expect, but he remains an intriguing talent. After being traded to the Islanders last season he was given a larger role than he had in Toronto and responded well with nine points in 18 games and strong possession metrics.\n\nWhile Engvall frustrated the Maple Leafs at times, it's unusual to find a free agent whose best years are ahead of him and that description could fit the speedy winger.\n\nUpdate: Engvall re-signed with the Islanders on a seven-year, $21 million contract.\n\n29. Evan Rodrigues\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 30\n\nPosition: LW/C\n\n2022-23 team: Colorado Avalanche\n\n2022-23 stats: 69 GP, 13 G, 26 A, 39 P, 56.4% CF\n\nSummary: Rodrigues is an eight-year NHL veteran, but he established a new level of production over the last two with 82 points in 151 games. The 17:51 he skated per night with the Avalanche last season was a career-high by more than two minutes. He took to the larger role with aplomb and meshed well with superstar center Nathan MacKinnon.\n\nRodrigues is a similar utility forward to Kerfoot in that he can move around the lineup as needed, but he's a year older and doesn't have much of a penalty-killing track record. He's also a notoriously poor finisher with a career shooting percentage of 7.8%.\n\nUpdate: Rodrigues signed a four-year, $12 million deal with the Panthers\n\n30. Phil Kessel\n\nAge on October 1, 2023: 35\n\nPosition: RW\n\n2022-23 team: Vegas Golden Knights\n\n2022-23 stats: 82 GP, 14 G, 22 A, 36 P, 56.4% CF\n\nSummary: You could make an argument that there are more worthy candidates for the final spot on this list, but it seems right to give Phil the Thrill some credit.\n\nKessell is still capable of making secondary offensive contributions, his durability is beyond reproach and he's a locker room sage who's seen and done it all. The winger is just eight points short of 1,000 and should get a chance to purse that milestone with somebody if he wants to keep playing.", "tiktoken_token_count": 6206, "llama_token_count": 7898}, {"source_name": "Nbcsportsbayarea.com", "author": "NBC Sports BayArea", "title": "2023 NHL Draft: Five winners, losers from first round", "description": "The Chicago Blackhawks got their man in Connor Bedard, but did the Anaheim Ducks stumble? Let's look at winners and losers from Round One of the 2023 NHL Draft.", "url": "https://www.nbcsportsbayarea.com/nhl/5-winners-losers-from-round-one-of-2023-nhl-draft/1637080/?partner=yahoo", "text": "Round 1 of the 2023 NHL Draft didn't really get going until the second overall pick.\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks started things off by taking Connor Bedard at No. 1 overall, which has been known for some time since the team jumped from No. 3 to the top spot via the draft lottery.\n\nThen came the Anaheim Ducks right after, but their pick didn't quite settle well within the hockey spectrum.\n\nSo, who came away as winners and who stumbled as losers from the first round? Let's skate through five:\n\nWinner: Chicago Blackhawks\n\nLet's start with the easy one. The Blackhawks phased away from the Patrick Kane era and immediately into the Bedard era.\n\nLottery luck was the reason that dream became a reality, and now Bedard is bringing an elite skill set to the table after logging 71 goals and 72 assists in 57 games with the WHL's Regina Pats in 2022-23.\n\nBedard, 17, doesn't need acres of space to thrive. His dribbling and puck-striking abilities are simply extraordinary for his age, and his output statistics are mesmerizing from an analytics perspective.\n\nThere was no way the Blackhawks could mess up this pick, and they effortlessly exit the draft as clear winners. And that's before they landed Oliver Moore at No. 19, a player who could've cracked the top 10 based on his pure skating prowess.\n\nLoser: Anaheim Ducks\n\nIt was known for quite some time that Bedard would go to Chicago. That made the Ducks' selection at No. 2 overall the real intrigue. And they provided it.\n\nAnaheim currently is in a five-year playoff drought and needs potential stars through the draft to help accelerate its rebuild. The Ducks then drafted center Leo Carlsson, which came across as quite confusing.\n\nIt's not on Carlsson, who was generally considered a top-five prospect entering the draft, but rather Anaheim passing on a player like Adam Fantilli, who could've been the top pick himself had it not been for Bedard.\n\nCarlsson, best known for his playmaking and creativity, will need to add a legitimate goal-scoring bag down the line to justify the Ducks' decision to grab him this high.\n\nWinner: Columbus Blue Jackets\n\nColumbus has been around as an NHL franchise for 22 years since its founding in 2001. But it has only made the playoffs six times and currently is in a three-year drought.\n\nFor a small-market team, getting high draft picks right is the healthiest way to climb up the standings. Fortunately for Columbus, Anaheim's decision to pass on Fantilli made the Blue Jackets' job much easier.\n\nFantilli, boasting a 6-foot-2, 195-pound frame, has immense physical strength that doesn't hinder his speed when skating around the ice. The Michigan product recorded 1.81 points per game as a freshman, the most by a draft-eligible player since Paul Kariya in 1992-93.\n\nHis output is already solid for his age, but considering his mechanics and shot angles could benefit from enhancing, Fantilli falling to the No. 3 overall pick was an unbelievably colossal win for the Blue Jackets.\n\nLoser: Trades\n\nGeneral managers on Wednesday didn't have much to do besides making selections.\n\nIn terms of draft-night trades, there were none. All 32 picks passed by and none moved to another team.\n\nThe only trade involving the 2023 draft came earlier in the day when the Colorado Avalanche acquired forward Ross Colton from the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for a second-round pick.\n\nWinner: Philadelphia Flyers\n\nPhiladelphia had quite a special talent fall in its lap. Matvei Michkov was widely seen as a clear-cut top-five pick, with the potential of going at No. 3. However, he dropped to the Flyers at No. 7.\n\nThere were a couple of reasons for his slide that involved his availability to play in the NHL since he's currently under contract with KHL's SKA St. Petersburg in Russia through the 2025-26 season.\n\nBut the Flyers have a scout based in Russia, Ken Hoodikoff, who has watched prospects there in person, per NBC Sports Philadelphia. So landing a talent like Michkov, even though it's not transparent when and if he'll able to transition to the NHL, at No. 7 has the potential to be a crucial win in the long run.", "tiktoken_token_count": 902, "llama_token_count": 1131}, {"source_name": "Inside the Magic", "author": "Laura Hermoza", "title": "Universal Studios vs. Disney World: Which One is Better?", "description": "The Universal Studios vs. Disney World debate is forever ongoing.

Even nearby Tampa has contending Busch Gardens to boast about. But it\u2019s the consistently steady competition between Walt Disney World Resort and Universal Orlando Resort that continues to reign supreme.\n\nSome folks are diehard Disney fans, while others are unanimously loyal to Universal. Then there are others\u2014mainly first-timers\u2014who haven\u2019t yet made up their minds on which is the better pursuit. If the last scenario describes you, then you\u2019re in luck because we at Inside the Magic have compiled this ultimate comparison guide.\n\nAn Overview\n\nWalt Disney World Resort and Universal Orlando Resort (sometimes referred to as \u201cUniversal Studios Orlando\u201d) are easily the most renowned theme park destinations in Central Florida. Both comprise onsite hotels, sport some of the most innovative and impressive attractions in the world, operate multiple parks, and draw in millions of visitors annually. Disney World was first on the scene, opening in October 1971. Universal came about nearly two decades later, in June 1990.\n\nSize Comparisons\n\nDoes bigger always mean better? That all depends on whether you perceive an enormous Resort destination as having more profuse offerings or just being more burdensome to navigate.\n\nDisney World spans over 40 square miles in contrast to Universal Orlando Resort, which roughly covers two square miles. Although, let it be known that the latter is in the process of expanding, which will nearly double its current size specs. That\u2019s still significantly smaller than Walt Disney World Resort in its entirety.\n\nRelated: Just How Big IS Walt Disney World?\n\nHow Many Different Parks?\n\nWalt Disney World Resort features four main theme parks. They are Magic Kingdom Park, EPCOT, Hollywood Studios, and Animal Kingdom Park. There are also two resident water parks onsite\u2014Disney\u2019s Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach.\n\nUniversal Orlando Resort has two distinct theme parks, which are Universal Studios Florida and Universal Islands of Adventure. The Resort also boasts an impressive water park\u2014Universal\u2019s Volcano Bay. Also, as previously mentioned, Universal is in the process of expanding with the establishment of a new theme park\u2014Universal Epic Universe, which is slated to open by 2025.\n\nConsiderations for the duration of your vacation and how much you can reasonably accomplish during your time in Orlando may impact your decision on whether you initially decide to do Disney or Universal. Of course, there is no requirement for having to do all the aforementioned Parks at either Resort.\n\nRelated: How Does Each Disney Park Rank Against One Another?\n\nOnsite Accommodations\n\nDisney and Universal each have their very own onsite accommodations, all of which range in designations to suit various budgets. Disney World offers over 25 onsite accommodations and several honorary Good Neighbor Resorts. The current onsite offerings for Universal Orlando hotels stand at eight, with various other hotels near Universal Orlando additionally.\n\nGuests at Disney and Universal accommodations experience a wide range of exclusive perks and amenities, including complimentary transportation to each one\u2019s theme parks, water parks, and Resort Entertainment hubs (Disney Springs and Universal CityWalk). Disney and Universal Resorts all excel in outdoing the area competition by leaps and bounds.\n\nRelated: Is It Better to Stay at a Disney Value Resort?\n\nWhich Attractions Are Where?\n\nIt can be confusing for inexperienced first-time vacationers to the Orlando Resort Area to keep straight about which attractions and experiences are exclusive to Disney World and which are the products of Universal. This is especially true about those gray area matters, like how Marvel is now associated with the Walt Disney Company, yet Universal Islands of Adventure features Marvel Super Hero Island. Universal also has a few Simpsons-related attractions despite Disney\u2019s having bought Fox. Other areas of confusion emerge regarding the fact that Hollywood Studios in Disney World sounds far more like a place in Universal, and the Jurassic Park attractions in Universal seem far more suited to DinoLand U.S.A. at Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom Park.\n\nSo, our best advice for prospective vacationers is to thoroughly research beforehand which experiences to pursue and to learn which ones are where before ever purchasing any Disney or Universal tickets.\n\nTyke Likes and Family Thrills\n\nYour decision may also essentially come down to the types of rides and attractions you\u2019re seeking. For instance, Disney World tends to focus more on family-friendly attractions that can be enjoyed by variously aged members of any traveling party. By contrast, Universal boasts many more high-octane thrill rides that may not necessarily suit smaller Guests or those looking for calmer experiences. In fact, more rides at Universal have height restrictions than those at Disney World.\n\nRelated: Which One\u2019s Better? Disney\u2019s TRON or Universal\u2019s Hagrid?\n\nIn-Park Entertainment\n\nBoth Resorts present nighttime spectaculars, although Disney provides much more variation within its various Parks. Not to be outdone, Universal boasts some pretty top-rated sights, too, like Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle, for instance.\n\nThere are also multiple stage shows happening on the scene at each location, along with various parades and other fun. As a beloved and timeless tradition, Disney always has a daytime parade offering, while Universal doesn\u2019t adhere to such a constant ritual. When there is a Universal parade, though, it comes as a more casual affair\u2014far less congested than the crammed-in Disney scenes.\n\nCharacters\n\nCharacter offerings at each location also differ. Disney has trademark-licensed Disney and Pixar Pals on the scene, while Universal has varying other entertaining personas from film and otherwise. Disney Character Meet and Greets can sometimes be lengthy with extensive lines, while Universal\u2019s approach is more of a low-key mingling on-the-street affair. Disney also provides many more Character Meal engagements throughout Parks and even at some onsite Resorts.\n\nSeasonal Events\n\nYou can enjoy seasonal happenings at both locations at various times during the year. Holiday happenings, particularly around Halloween and Christmas, garner varying special celebrations. For the former, Disney is renowned for Mickey\u2019s Not-So-Scary Halloween Parties, while Universal offers Halloween Horror Nights. Both are after-hours ticketed extras. Universal\u2019s pricing is admittedly cheaper, but Disney\u2019s offering is far more family-friendly.\n\nMickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party reigns on the Disney scene, along with special ongoing holiday happenings throughout EPCOT. Universal focuses on various Grinch-related happenings, including a special nighttime parade and Breakfast Meet and Greet. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter also gets in on the seasonal celebrations. Additionally, there\u2019s a wonderful wintertime food festival to take note of at Universal.\n\nEPCOT\u2019s acclaimed festivals at Disney World are internationally renowned. Furthermore, there are now many seasonal happenings throughout the year, more times than not. The EPCOT International Food & Wine Festival is still the one that gets the highest recognition, though. But let it be known that Universal has a pretty hopping Mardi Gras food festival celebration onsite too, which occurs between February and mid-April.\n\nRelated: Disney Halloween Party Price Nearly Triples in Less Than a Decade\n\nFood for Thought\n\nFood festivals aside, let\u2019s discuss the dining options at both locations. Its grander size gives Disney an advantage in providing more options. That also means there\u2019s more versatility regarding specific cuisine features. We also previously mentioned that Disney has more Character Dining options.\n\nWhile Universal Resort can\u2019t compete with the versatile dining at Disney, it does succeed in offering better pricing for what you do get. This is especially impactful for those who generally stick to quick-service dining. Because neither Resort is offering dining plans presently, you\u2019ll be paying full price at both locations.\n\nDisney may be better for those seeking versatility in cuisine and experience, but Universal is more all-around convenient in pricing and the ease at which you can dine at a given venue. While you\u2019d do well to make advance dining reservations for places you\u2019re hoping to score a spot at, it\u2019s much more necessary to do so at Disney than it is at Universal.\n\nExpress Passes\n\nDisney and Universal each offer express pass options for enjoying select attractions with little or no wait time. Disney presents an extra paid-for Genie+ service. Additionally, Guests may purchase individual Lightning Lanes for some attractions that aren\u2019t included in the aforementioned Genie+ service. Universal features the Universal Express System but does an about-face move regarding the pricing for this paid extra, as it is shockingly higher than what Disney presents. Universal Express starts at $90 a person but increases on peak days to as much as $380! Current Genie+/Lightning Lane costs are nowhere near those prices. Let it be known, however, that Universal Express doesn\u2019t require prearranging arrival times. With Disney, you have to make requested purchases as far in advance as possible (depending on if you are a Resort Guest or staying off-property). This may mean waking up early the day of, on your vacation, no less!\n\nTickets\n\nYou may purchase single-day tickets to Universal or Disney World or upgrade to one of several multi-day combos at either location. While all prices are subject to change, current single-day (adult) pricing for all four Disney Parks is as follows: $154 for Magic Kingdom Park, $139 for EPCOT, $149 for Hollywood Studios, and $134 for Animal Kingdom Park. Single-day ticket prices for Universal Studios Florida and Universal Islands of Adventure are both currently priced at $109 for adults and $104 for kids. That said, Universal Orlando tickets are generally cheaper than those at Disney Parks.\n\nAdd-ons that allow visiting more than one Park a day can be applied to both Disney and Universal tickets alike. At Disney World, this popular option is known as the Park Hopper pass, and it works by letting Guests visit as many of Disney\u2019s four theme Parks in a single day as they want. Regular base tickets limit you to just one Park a day. Do note that Park Hopping only applies to Disney theme Parks. For those wishing to add water parks to the Park Hopping experience, there\u2019s an additional Park Hopper Plus option.\n\nUniversal allows you to choose from two single-day multi-park ticket upgrades. One is the rightly named 2-Park-1-Day ticket, which covers both Universal Studios Florida and Universal Islands of Adventure, and the other is a 3-Park option that also includes Volcano Bay.\n\nAs a common trend, Disney\u2019s current ticket and Park Hopping system is a bit more stressful and complicated, at least for the present time. That\u2019s because Guests are still required to make advance Park Reservations in addition to purchasing Park tickets. This infringes on the freedom of former Park Hopping as, for the present time, anyone with Park Hopper cannot \u201chop\u201d a second Park until after 2 p.m. Universal doesn\u2019t require any Advance Park Reservations, which earns it higher marks in Guest satisfaction in that regard.\n\nAnnual Passes\n\nBoth Resorts offer varying Annual Passes based on price, preference, and other included perks. Disney World currently has only one option for out-of-state visitors, though\u2014the Disney Incredi-Pass, which goes for $1,399. Other Annual Passes from Disney include Disney Sorcerer ($969) for Vacation Club Members or Florida State Residents, Disney Pirate Pass ($749), and Disney Pixie Dust ($399).\n\nWith some overlapping exceptions, Universal Passes tend to be cheaper, with its most expensive Premier Pass going for $904.99. Other Universal Passes include the Preferred Pass ($629.99), Power Pass ($474.99), and Seasonal Pass ($424.99).\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nWalt Disney World may offer many more pursuits across the board, but those extras generally result in elevated expenses that may be its undoing. Universal Orlando Resort tends to be more low-key and doesn\u2019t pack the same stressful need for preplanning. But again, it\u2019s that balance of iconic experiences and the cost for said experiences that each prospective Guest must personally consider before making any final decisions. Your perfect choice isn\u2019t necessarily ideal for someone else.\n\nDo you think Disney World or Universal Orlando is better?

The Crimson Tide face USF at Raymond James Stadium on Sept. 16. By then, a starter presumably will have been sorted out. For now, Notre Dame transfer Tyler Buchner, two-year backup Jalen Milroe and former five-star recruit Ty Simpson are vying for the job.\n\nWhile possessing arguably the most name recognition, Buchner is hardly a front-runner. The quintessential dual threat, he started three games at Notre Dame last season but missed 10 games with a shoulder injury. He struggled mightily in the Irish\u2019s 2023 spring game (8-for-18, 44 yards, interception) even as Wake Forest transfer Sam Hartman excelled.\n\nMilroe had his moments last season as Bryce Young\u2019s backup. When Young was injured in the first half against Arkansas, the 6-foot-2 Texas native entered and led Alabama to five touchdowns in a 49-26 romp. In his first career start the following week against Texas A&M, he totaled 194 yards with three touchdown passes and a pick.\n\nSimpson, a Tennessee native ranked as the No. 1 quarterback for the class of 2022 by the On3 consensus, made cameos in four games last season.\n\n\u201cI used the cake analogy because it\u2019s not done yet,\u201d Saban said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a decision that needs to be made at this point in time, nor are we ready to make that decision at this time until somebody separates themselves.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

And the NCAA\u2019s enforcement arm, which recently dealt a haymaker to the prior regime after hundreds of violations were uncovered, rendered only a couple of jabs to the current group.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s ever been a better time to be a Vol,\u201d third-year coach Josh Heupel said.\n\nIf all that weren\u2019t sufficient evidence that Heupel\u2019s living under a good sign, here\u2019s this anomaly: He\u2019s got a seasoned quarterback \u2014 a 23-year-old who actually waited his turn \u2014 poised to step in for 2022 SEC Offensive Player of the Year Hendon Hooker.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare that you\u2019re able to keep quarterbacks inside your quarterback room,\u201d Heupel said.\n\nThe Vols\u2019 hopes of preserving the momentum and mojo harnessed during last fall\u2019s 11-2 season hinge on sixth-year collegian Joe Milton III, a veritable oddity in college\u2019s free-agent era. A 6-foot-5 Pahokee native who began his career at Michigan, Milton won Tennessee\u2019s starting job upon his arrival in 2021, but sustained an ankle injury in Game Two, paving the way for Hooker\u2019s emergence.\n\n\u201cI was hurt, I couldn\u2019t go back in the game no more, so Hendon did his job,\u201d Milton said. \u201cHe went in there, he executed and he kept the offense rolling. What can I say if the coaches chose to (stick with him)? I mean, he did his job.\u201d\n\nIn lieu of the portal, Milton persisted. Now, Heupel has the rare luxury of replacing a third-round NFL draftee with a player well-versed in his breakneck offensive system.\n\n\u201cI truly respect Joe Milton so much for the fact that he had every opportunity to leave, every reason to leave, people talking bad about him and obviously he loses the (starting) job \u2014 all those different things,\u201d said Vols senior tight end Jacob Warren, who joined Heupel and Milton at SEC media days on Thursday.\n\n\u201cBut just the fact that he did stick through it and he learned a lot and he grew a lot through the last two years, definitely has my respect.\u201d\n\nBarring another injury, Milton\u2019s first start against an SEC foe will come in his home state, Sept. 16 against the Gators at The Swamp. In his most recent Florida appearance, he torched Clemson for 251 passing yards and three touchdown (completing 19 of 28 passes) with no picks in a 31-14 Orange Bowl triumph in January.\n\nHe had reassumed the starting role when Hooker tore his ACL in the fourth quarter of an astonishing 63-38 loss at South Carolina in mid-November. The following week against Vanderbilt, he essentially played point guard in a 56-0 romp of Vanderbilt, passing for 141 yards while the Vols ran for 362.\n\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\u2019s college football teams every day.

Explore all your options\n\nHis MVP performance in the Orange Bowl followed.\n\n\u201cNobody inside our program was surprised by the success that he had when he got his opportunity last year as a starter,\u201d Heupel said. \u201cHe played extremely well when he got in football games throughout the course of the season. But his preparation, his urgency, how he practiced, all those things led to everybody inside the building believing that he was going to play at that type of level.\u201d\n\nQuestion now is, can he maintain that type of level? The nation\u2019s seventh-ranked pro-style quarterback (per 247Sports) in a previous life, Milton is 5-4 as a college starter, with no more than five starts in one season (for Michigan in the COVID-19 year). Though he never has thrown an interception in 144 attempts as a Vol, he never has been known for his mobility either.\n\nYet Heupel said during spring practice, Milton excelled in \u201cnavigating the pocket.\u201d\n\nToday, a fan base remains grateful he didn\u2019t navigate the portal.\n\n\u201cI think one of the great stories in college football in the era of the transfer portal is his trust and ability to recognize areas that he can continue to grow in and trust the people around him, that we have his best interests at heart,\u201d Heupel said.\n\n\u201cUnderstand that within our scheme, he\u2019s going to have an opportunity to do everything he wants to, which is be one of the best players in college football.\u201d\n\nContact Joey Knight at jknight@tampabay.com.

Create explosive plays. Win the rushing battle. Play complementary football with offense, defense and special teams working together to win a game.\n\nOne issue: Napier isn\u2019t any other football coach. He\u2019s the coach of the Gators, where fans don\u2019t just want to win. They want to win by lighting up the scoreboard, as Florida did with Steve Spurrier and Danny Wuerffel, Urban Meyer and Tim Tebow.\n\n\u201cI love those days,\u201d Napier said during the recent SEC spring meetings. \u201cGive me a Wuerffel, five receivers that run 4.4 (seconds in the 40-yard dash), and let\u2019s go play.\u201d\n\nAlas, barring a remarkable, immediate transformation by Graham Mertz or Jack Miller III, Napier does not have a Wuerffel on his roster. And his receiving corps looks pedestrian by SEC standards.\n\nNapier\u2019s first season doesn\u2019t inspire much confidence that he\u2019ll lead an offensive renaissance in Gainesville. UF had a top-five pick (Anthony Richardson) at quarterback and scored only 29.5 points per game \u2014 the second-worst figure in Napier\u2019s eight seasons as a head coach or offensive coordinator.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to wonder whether Billy Ball is compatible with the fanbase\u2019s expectations. Napier thinks it is, once the talent level, schemes and organizational structure click.\n\n\u201cIf we do those things \u2026 if we evaluate well, we recruit well, we get good quarterback play, we get extremely fast and explosive skill players and we\u2019re winning the turnover battle and we\u2019re winning the explosive battle \u2014 the points will add up, right?\u201d Napier said.\n\nThey did at Napier\u2019s last stop. His 2019 Ragin\u2019 Cajuns ranked in the top 10 nationally in scoring (37.9 points per game), total offense (494.1 yards per game), yards per play (7.01) and plays from scrimmage that covered at least 10 yards (18.1 per game). Louisiana\u2019s statistics regressed slightly the next year, but he still fielded a top-30 scoring offense (33.6 points per game).\n\nNapier didn\u2019t have a stable of Jacquez Greens and Reidel Anthonys on that roster, either. He did, however, have great running backs. His 2019 backfield had three players who have spent time in the NFL: Elijah Mitchell was the 49ers\u2019 leading rusher in 2021, Raymond Calais was a Bucs\u2019 seventh-round pick in 2020, and Trey Ragas has been with the Rams and Raiders. Together, they fueled the nation\u2019s No. 6 rushing attack; Mitchell and Ragas led a top-25 run game the next year, too.\n\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\u2019s college football teams every day.

Florida\u2019s offensive strengths last year were a solid offensive line and a pair of talented running backs, Montrell Johnson and Trevor Etienne. That fits one of Napier\u2019s stated offensive goals, winning the ground game.\n\nWill that be enough to win over Florida supporters?\n\nThe question is relevant because of the unique nature of this fan base. Jim McElwain won the SEC East in each of his first two seasons but was chewed up in Year 3 partially because of fans\u2019 frustrations with his ugly offenses. His successor, Dan Mullen, knew from his time as UF\u2019s offensive coordinator that victories weren\u2019t always enough. During his first spring as head coach, he reminisced about how fans reacted if the team hadn\u2019t scored four touchdowns by halftime.\n\n\u201cThere were people telling me I was No. 1,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cDifferent fingers.\u201d\n\nThose fingers waved goodbye to him in 2021 because his entertaining offenses couldn\u2019t overshadow a historically bad defense and subpar recruiting.\n\nThe last point is key. Though Napier developed overlooked prospects into Sun Belt standouts at Louisiana \u2014 lightly recruited quarterback Levi Lewis threw a school-record 74 passing touchdowns under Napier \u2014 he\u2019ll need more than three-star recruits to put up 40 points per game or win titles in the SEC. He is starting to win the recruiting battles necessary to make that happen.\n\nThe Gators\u2019 2023 class featured three blue-chip receivers, including speedsters Aidan Mizell and Andy Jean. Florida has non-binding oral commitments from five-star quarterback DJ Lagway, one of the nation\u2019s top tight ends (Amir Jackson) and a pair of four-star receivers (IMG Academy\u2019s Jerrae Hawkins and Carrollwood Day\u2019s Izaiah Williams).\n\nNapier\u2019s rushing history suggests his Gators will probably never be as wide open as Spurrier\u2019s Fun \u2018n\u2019 Gun. But he has shown that Billy Ball can pile on points in a differently entertaining fashion. One Florida fans can probably embrace \u2014 as long as the wins come, too.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

But the \u2018Noles have an experienced, talented roster, led by my ACC preseason player of the year, quarterback Jordan Travis. I trust him more than Clemson\u2019s Cade Klubnik, just as I trust Mike Norvell\u2019s offense more than whatever the Dabo Swinney-Garrett Riley system looks like. I also give FSU an edge on offensive skill talent, and I think the defense will be good again.\n\nThere are, however, a few potential pitfalls. Clemson has generally outrecruited FSU, so depth is a concern. There\u2019s a big gap between star defensive end Jared Verse and the Seminoles\u2019 options to replace him, if he suffered a significant injury. It\u2019s also possible that Riley is a wunderkind like his older brother, USC coach Lincoln Riley. Maybe he\u2019ll immediately fix the Tigers\u2019 offense. The fact that their Week 4 matchup is at Clemson is another factor, though a rematch in the title game would be here in Charlotte at a neutral site.\n\nA few other thoughts from my ballot before the full media poll comes out Tuesday:\n\n\u2022 As usual, I had no idea what to do about Miami, which is consistently one of the hardest teams in the nation to figure out. If quarterback Tyler Van Dyke returns to his 2021 form and the Hurricanes\u2019 talent plays up to its potential, Miami could finish third, if not higher. I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Miami continued to struggle and finished as low as ninth. I settled in the middle at No. 6.\n\n\u2022 North Carolina was an easy choice at No. 3 for me because of star quarterback Drake Maye (whom I also strongly considered as my preseason player of the year). The future first-round pick is the separating factor between the Tar Heels and the rest of the ACC\u2019s large middle class. No need to overthink things, despite my concerns surrounding the defense.\n\n\u2022 Though I like Jeff Brohm\u2019s long-term future at Louisville, I\u2019m not sure about what he\u2019ll field in his first season at his alma mater. The Cardinals\u2019 schedule doesn\u2019t include Florida State, Clemson or North Carolina, which pushed them to fifth.\n\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\u2019s college football teams every day.

I don\u2019t feel strongly about that prediction or many others, but I\u2019ll explain my reasoning.\n\nSMU, Texas San Antonio and Tulane are the jumbled but clear top tier. I put them in that order. SMU\u2019s top-15 transfer class and a potential second-year boost from coach Rhett Lashlee made them my preseason championship pick ahead of the Roadrunners (who have high-end talent but are jumping from Conference USA) and Tulane (which I think will regress slightly after losing star running back Tyjae Spears).\n\nMemphis\u2019 stability at head coach and in the conference made the Tigers fourth, just ahead of new member Florida Atlantic and East Carolina (which loses all-time leading passer Holton Ahler).\n\nRice, surprisingly, ended up 10th on my ballot. I generally downgraded the newcomers because of concerns about depth as they move up, but I gave the Owls the benefit of the doubt thanks largely to former five-star quarterback JT Daniels.\n\nUSF landed in the bottom tier with Tulsa, Alabama Birmingham and Charlotte. All four teams have new coaches and are coming off seasons that ranged from mediocre to awful. I slotted the Bulls ahead of Charlotte (a bad team in a lesser conference last year) and the Blazers (I\u2019m skeptical about the short-term and long-term prospects under former Bucs quarterback Trent Dilfer).\n\nI do, however, think USF will be better this year, even if I don\u2019t view the Bulls as a bowl team. It\u2019s hard to envision the defense being worse or the team starting slower; some progress is inevitable. It\u2019s also reasonable to expect the injury luck to improve, too. Those factors alone should lead to better performances despite my questions about the talent level for Golesh\u2019s first year.\n\nThe Bulls get a break by not having to face SMU or Tulane in conference play, but the non-conference schedule features a national title contender (Alabama), a Conference USA frontrunner (Western Kentucky) and a trip to a UConn program that finally looks competent again. That means we should judge this season on baby steps and incremental growth, even if the win-loss record doesn\u2019t make a major leap forward.\n\nOur AAC predicted order of finish\n\n1. SMU\n\n2.

UCF\u2019s Gus Malzahn recently announced he is relinquishing play-calling duties to his offensive coordinator (Darin Hinshaw). Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz is doing the same.\n\nJimbo Fisher, who recently hired former Arkansas and Louisville coach Bobby Petrino as his coordinator, is expected to follow suit.\n\nBilly Napier? Not so fast.\n\nAfter a thorough assessment of his program in the wake of a 6-7 inaugural season, the second-year Gators coach said he didn\u2019t deem it necessary to surrender his play-calling role. Besides, he still loves it.\n\n\u201cI think it was part of our evaluation this offseason,\u201d Napier told reporters Wednesday at SEC media days.\n\n\u201cYou know, I think like most parts of our organization and our process, we will improve in Year Two. I think it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to evaluate. I like having my hand on the scripts, the installation, that process. I think I can help establish our identity and personality as a team through that process.\u201d\n\nWhile the Gators were a respectable 37th nationally in total offense (424.1 yards per game) and averaged 6.58 yards per play last season, critics have pounced on the fact they were 115th in completion percentage (54.4 percent) with a quarterback (Anthony Richardson) who was picked fourth overall in the NFL draft. Napier also served as quarterbacks coach.\n\nIt was similar mediocrity at Missouri (82nd nationally in total offense) that compelled Drinkwitz to relinquish the role.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t giving us the best advantage that we could have offensively to be be successful,\u201d said Drinkwitz, whose 2022 squad also finished 6-7. \u201cAnd so it was my estimation that I needed to embrace my role more as the head coach and do the things that needed to be done there and turn over the play-calling to somebody else.\u201d\n\nNapier indicated he\u2019s not at that point \u2014 yet.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s part of the evaluation to some degree, but I feel confident in our process,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done it before, and I do think some of the growing pains that come with Year One, I went through some of those things much like some of our other staff and other players did. So I\u2019m very hopeful we\u2019ll continue to improve, and I\u2019ll benefit from Year Two just as much as any player or any staff member.\u201d\n\nContact Joey Knight at jknight@tampabay.com.

So I got really, really excited about him, and I think he\u2019s going to add great value to us.\u201d\n\nFewer first-down clock stoppages\n\nA rule change being implemented in college football this fall isn\u2019t necessarily expected to put a restrictor plate on the breakneck pace of the modern game.\n\nBut it just might cut down on offenses\u2019 collective tread.\n\nStarting this season, the game clock will keep running after a team gets a first down inbounds, except in the final two minutes of each half. Additionally, teams won\u2019t be allowed to call consecutive timeouts during the same dead-ball period, essentially limiting just how long teams can ice a kicker.\n\nThe changes were explained Tuesday morning at the SEC Media Days by league officials coordinator John McDaid, who noted college games averaged 178 plays last season (and 177 in the SEC). While that figure represents a five-year low, the average barely has changed in the last half-decade.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not necessarily concern for games that average 180 plays a game,\u201d McDaid said. \u201cThere is concern for games that have 200-plus plays per game. There are a number of them each and every year in each and every conference.\u201d\n\nThe first-down rule basically reflects the NFL\u2019s. McDaid said the rules committee (comprising administrators, athletic directors, coaches, officials) discussed other possible changes for the purpose of reducing the number of plays per game, but adopted only the amended first-down rule.\n\n\u201cWe have this rule change for this year,\u201d McDaid said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see what effect it has on our game from an overall number of plays.\u201d\n\nToo much team speed\n\nShortly after indicating how his program continues mourning the deaths of a player and staffer killed in what police say was a high-speed street race in January, Georgia coach Kirby Smart was asked about the sequence of traffic-related incidents that have followed.\n\nStay updated on Tampa Bay\u2019s sports scene Subscribe to our free Sports Today newsletter We\u2019ll send you news and analysis on the Bucs, Lightning, Rays and Florida\u2019s college football teams every day.

Tennessee at Florida, Sept. 16\n\nAfter becoming the first Gators coach to lose to rivals Tennessee, Georgia and FSU in the same season, Napier could use a Week 3 victory over the Volunteers to boost his standing in the fan base. It\u2019s also Tennessee\u2019s first real test, so it will give us a gauge on how much of Josh Heupel\u2019s success should be attributed to Golesh, his now-former coordinator.\n\n12. UCF at Kansas State, Sept. 23\n\n11. UCF at Oklahoma, Oct. 21\n\nThough Kansas State is the reigning league champion and UCF\u2019s first conference game in the Big 12, the trip to Oklahoma\u2019s storied 80,000-seat stadium will be the Knights\u2019 real \u201cWelcome to the big time\u201d moment.

The Gators are recruiting well enough to close the talent gap with the back-to-back national champions, but they\u2019re not there yet.\n\n5. Miami at FSU, Nov. 11\n\nThough two of the last three meetings were blowouts, this rivalry almost always delivers intense drama. I think it returns this fall.\n\n4. FSU at Florida, Nov. 25\n\nLast year\u2019s game was arguably this rivalry\u2019s best since 2006, if not earlier. The Seminoles might need a win in The Swamp to keep their playoff hopes alive.\n\n3. Florida at Utah, Aug. 31 (Thursday)\n\nThe stakes will be high for the Utes, who will again be Pac-12 contenders (assuming quarterback Cam Rising fully recovers from a torn ACL). A Week 1 win at one of toughest venues in the West would be huge for the Gators\u2019 turnaround, too.\n\n2. FSU at Clemson, Sept. 23\n\nThe ACC favorites and playoff hopefuls have a Week 4 faceoff in Death Valley, where FSU will have a serious shot at ending a seven-game losing streak in the series. How will the Seminoles\u2019 strong defense fare against a new-look Tigers offense under coordinator Garrett Riley? This would have been atop my list if both teams were still in the same division. But the new scheduling format allows for a possible winner-take-all rematch in the Dec. 2 ACC championship. Which means my No. 1 is the same as last year ...\n\n1. FSU vs. LSU, Sept. 3 (Sunday) in Orlando\n\nThis game has everything: Two big-name programs and preseason top-10 teams squaring off at a neutral site a year after playing a thriller decided by a blocked extra point with no time left. A loss won\u2019t end the playoff hopes for either team, but the winner will get some wiggle room and solidify itself as a final four contender. This is FSU\u2019s biggest game since the 2017 opener against Alabama. That game didn\u2019t live up to the hype. Here\u2019s hoping this one does.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

Check out more newsletters\n\nThe Rangers have hit an expected lull in the action a bit past the midway point of this extended offseason.\n\nThe only outstanding business left for GM Chris Drury is finalizing Alexis Lafreniere\u2019s next contract.\n\nBut there are questions as 2023-24 approaches. You have them and, believe me, so do I. But I will endeavor to answer yours before I reel off mine in the pages of The Post through the summer and into camp.\n\nHere we go, with questions relayed from Sports+ members in the Texts from the Blue Seats text-message conversation with my colleague, Mollie Walker, who is on a well-earned summer siesta.\n\nThis is supposed to be the year Will Cuylle and Brennan Othmann, among other young players, step in. Why did Chris Drury feel the need to sign so many veterans?\n\n\u2014 Leonard Solomon\n\nI\u2019m not so sure the organization has set that ETA on the two \u2014 what else? \u2014 left wings. The Rangers do not want to make the mistake of rushing Othmann, who, at age 20, will be entering his first pro season. The same thought process applies to Cuylle, who will be in his second pro season at age 21.\n\nTyler Pitlick joined the Rangers from the Blues, but can be sent to the AHL during the season with no salary-cap pain.\n\nNHLI via Getty Images NHLI via Getty Images\n\nThe veteran free-agent forwards to whom you refer \u2014 Nick Bonino, Tyler Pitlick, Riley Nash, Alex Belzile and even Blake Wheeler \u2014 can be sent to Hartford without adverse effect on the cap. In a sense, they are placeholders until the kids prove they are ready for the NHL.\n\nI would be surprised if Cuylle is not in New York by Thanksgiving, at the latest, and I don\u2019t think the Rangers will hesitate to promote Othmann if he excels in the AHL and there is a need for him in the top six.\n\nIf you could undo any one trade the Rangers executed over the past eight years (in either the Jeff Gorton or Drury era), which one would it be?\n\n\u2014 Christopher Walkley\n\nLook, we all acknowledge that the Ryan McDonagh-J.T. Miller trade to Tampa Bay at the 2018 deadline was botched in all sorts of ways.\n\nI\u2019ve never understood why there seemed to be so little interest in McDonagh, who at very worst would have been a two-playoffs and one full-season rental at the time, but even more so I never understood why then-GM Jeff Gorton felt the need to move the captain under those circumstances. And tossing Miller in as a throw-in to secure Libor Hajek in return? It\u2019s almost impossible to believe that the team got almost zero return for McDonagh and Miller.\n\nSo, yes, that\u2019s the one to unwind.\n\nRyan McDonagh proved a valuable pickup in 2018 for the Lightning, who reached the playoffs each season he was with them and won back-to-back Stanley Cups.\n\nGetty Images Getty Images\n\nCarl Hagelin to Anaheim for Emerson Etem and a second-rounder on the floor of the 2015 draft in Glen Sather\u2019s last trade as a GM was another fiasco that hastened the team\u2019s demise. Woof. I\u2019d sure undo that one, too, if possible.\n\nThis team has underachieved in the postseason for a while, and all Drury has done is tweak. When does someone have to admit this team doesn\u2019t have what it takes to win a Cup?\n\n\u2014 Steven Ovadia\n\nWell, they did go to the conference finals two seasons ago, so the (long-time) underachieving-in-the-playoffs narrative doesn\u2019t exactly apply, does it?\n\nI understand the frustration, but I don\u2019t think that changing the entire coaching staff (other than Forever Benoit Allaire) after this spring\u2019s first-round defeat could be considered only a \u201ctweak.\u201d\n\nOf course, if you mean that winning the Cup once since 1940 represents underachieving in the playoffs for a while, you\u2019ll get no argument.\n\nIf some of the players on the Rangers in their exit interviews expressed some frustration with Gerard Gallant, do you have a sense of what the scene was? And would guys like Patrick Kane and Vladimir Tarasenko, who had both experienced winning the Cup, offer some more insight there? I would be curious to hear what they thought.\n\n\u2014 Thomas Vitiello\n\nGerard Gallant\u2019s playoff tactics against the Devils did not win him many games or many fans among the Rangers players.\n\nCorey Sipkin for the NY Post Corey Sipkin for the NY Post\n\nThese were one-on-one meetings with Drury. My understanding is that a meaningful number of veterans expressed frustration that the team was not tactically well-enough prepared for the Devils and was unable to make mid-game or mid-series adjustments.\n\nWhile style of play is dramatically different these days, would Harry Howell make your top six Rangers defensemen? Who would your top six be, and who would be your No. 1 Ranger be at center and the wings?\n\n\u2014 Paul Rieschick\n\nOh, for sure, Howell would be among the Rangers all-time top six, joining Brian Leetch, Brad Park, Adam Fox, Ron Greschner and Bill Gadsby.\n\nRod Gilbert on the right, Jean Ratelle in the middle, Vic Hadfield on the left. GAG Line Forever.\n\nWho stays or goes? Barclay Goodrow or Tarasenko?\n\n\u2014 Michael Borodinsky\n\nI believe that has already been established, hasn\u2019t it?\n\nDo you think with Tarasenko not signing as of yet, it\u2019s more likely he re-signs with the Rangers?\n\n\u2014 Mark Crawley\n\nNo, I do not. Nor do I foresee the team signing Kane when he completes his rehab.\n\nIf not Peter Laviolette, who would you have chosen to be the next Rangers head coach?\n\n\u2014 Michael Silvers\n\nPatrick Roy led the Avalanche to a 130-92 record in three season behind the bench, but has yet to find an NHL team willing to hire him since.\n\nGetty Images NHLI via Getty Images\n\nThere is no doubt that I \u2014 unlike every NHL general manager with a coaching vacancy to fill over the last half-dozen years \u2014 would have invited Patrick Roy for an interview and gone from there.\n\nJust for fun, let\u2019s pretend Artemi Panarin didn\u2019t have a no-movement clause this offseason. Do you think the Rangers would have traded him?\n\n\u2014 Robert Castano\n\nI don\u2019t know that Panarin would have been traded given the cap scenarios around the league, but I do think there\u2019d have been discussions.\n\nWant to catch a game? The Rangers schedule with links to buy tickets can be found here.\n\nDo you think the Rangers lost to the Devils more because of a lack of team speed, or because leadership and coaching were no-shows in Games 4, 5 and 7? Or all of the above? I think the opening night roster in October will be a deeper more balanced team than the one that lost to the Devils. Do you agree?\n\n\u2014 Ethan Levine\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a lack of speed that doomed the Rangers, but their inability to slow down the Devils anywhere on the ice. They never developed a forecheck. Three no-shows in the final four games sealed it.\n\nAnd as to this season\u2019s opening night roster vs. the playoff group, if we\u2019re talking about a healthy Patrick Kane, I\u2019ll take the playoff lineup.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the Rangers\u2019 lack of speed that hurt them in the playoffs so much as their inability to slow down the Devils.\n\nBill Kostroun for the NY Post Bill Kostroun for the NY Post\n\nWhat happened with Rammer?\n\n\u2014 Michael Dachs, Paul Palmer\n\nJim Ramsay\u2019s tenure as head medical trainer did not come to an end because of anything related to job performance. That is the best (and only) answer that I can provide.\n\nDo you think the Rangers have addressed the lack of grit that was sorely missing in last year\u2019s playoffs?\n\n\u2014 Peter Huh\n\nNot to my liking, no.\n\nWhy is the new deal for Lafreniere taking so long? Is the size of K\u2019Andre Miller\u2019s deal a problem in that it leaves too little for him and any cap room?\n\n\u2014 Jonathan Moore\n\nThis is not out of the ordinary. Kaapo Kakko didn\u2019t sign last year until July 28. There is approximately $3 million available to sign Lafreniere, who should come in at the $2.4 million-to-$2.7 million range on a two-year bridge deal. Miller\u2019s contract has no impact.\n\nThough he has not played for Peter Laviolette before, Zac Jones\u2019 potential should get him time as part of the Rangers\u2019 third defensive pair.\n\nGetty Images NHLI via Getty Images\n\nBecause he played for Laviolette, does Eric Gustafsson already have the inside track on third pair? Do you think it\u2019ll truly be an open competition with Zac Jones, Ben Harpur, etc.?\n\n\u2014 Zebop\n\nProbably, but I think the Rangers need to give Jones \u2014 who has a potentially higher ceiling than Gustafsson \u2014 a legitimate shot at the job.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1956, "llama_token_count": 2367}, {"source_name": "Hollywood Life", "author": "Eric Todisco", "title": "Travis Barker Shows Off Adorable Matching Jerseys For Him & His Baby Boy With Kourtney Kardashian: Photo", "description": "Travis Barker bought two custom ice hockey jerseys \u2014 one for him, and one for his son who will be born soon!", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2023/07/11/travis-barker-matching-jerseys-son-kourtney-kardashian-photo/", "text": "Travis Barker will be twinning with his and Kourtney Kardashian\u2018s son once the little one arrives.

The North Vancouver native was the most hyped prospect since Connor McDavid was drafted first overall by the Edmonton Oilers in 2015.\n\n\"It's incredible. I can't it put into words,\" Bedard said in his Wednesday news conference. \"Growing up, they were going on their runs, winning [Stanley] Cups. You see the United Center going crazy and all of Chicago getting behind them. I'm so happy to part of the Blackhawks organization.\"\n\nChicago earned the right to select Bedard after winning the 2023 NHL draft lottery, despite having only the third-best odds to win the No. 1 pick this year at 11.5%. The Blackhawks last selected first overall in 2007, when they took winger Patrick Kane.\n\nBedard was granted exceptional status as a 15-year-old to play in the Western Hockey League, the first time the WHL granted such an exception. This year, he was the inaugural winner of the IIHF Male Player of the Year Award, leading Canada to the gold medal at the World Junior Championship with a tournament-best 23 points (nine goals, 14 assists) in January. He swept the player of the year, top prospect and top scorer awards at the Canadian Hockey League awards after recording 143 points (71 goals, 72 assists) in 52 games for the Pats.\n\n\"We'll see. We'll let him figure that out,\" Blackhawks general manager Kyle Davidson said, when asked about his expectations for Bedard. \"He's a pretty special player, a very special person. We'll let him determine how special that first season is.\"\n\nBedard's arrival signals a new era for the Blackhawks, who completed a run of three Stanley Cups in six years in 2015. He joins a team that finished with a .360 points percentage in the standings, the worst season for Chicago since 2003-04. Kane was traded to the New York Rangers. The team parted ways with captain Jonathan Toews, an unrestricted free agent, as well.\n\n\"First of all, I want to make the team. That's the No. 1 goal. I want to have an impact on the ice and in the room, to be a teammate and give my all every day. Those are some things I can control,\" Bedard said before the draft Tuesday in Nashville.\n\nThe Blackhawks started building around Bedard earlier in the week when they acquired winger Taylor Hall from the Boston Bruins. \"He won a Hart Trophy. He's had a great career, his talent level is remarkable. Fun player to watch, for sure,\" Bedard said.\n\nEven with a phenom like Bedard, it could be a multiyear process for Chicago to return to prominence. It took Alex Ovechkin three years to bring the Washington Capitals to the playoffs after being selected first overall in 2004. It took Jack Hughes of the New Jersey Devils four years after going first overall in 2019.\n\n\"Listen, it doesn't need to necessarily have to happen right away, whether that's team success or individual success,\" said Tampa Bay Lightning captain Steven Stamkos, the first overall pick in 2008. \"I think he's going into a little bit of a different situation in Chicago, where they've kind of embraced the rebuild and it's obviously one of the best hockey markets in the world. It was maybe a little easier for me to go to Tampa and not have as much pressure.\"\n\nStamkos said his advice to Bedard is to understand the leap he's about to make.\n\n\"It's the best league in the world and now you're competing against guys who are bigger and stronger and more experienced. So I don't think he's going to have any problem adjusting, but if he does, just enjoy the moment. It goes by fast,\" he said.\n\nAt No. 19 overall, the Blackhawks selected another center, Oliver Moore from the U.S. National Development Program.\n\nMoore wasn't a top line forward for the USNDP, but his speed allowed him to be a dynamic presence. The way he can accelerate, enter the zone and get a shot off with enviable speed is what makes Moore a special prospect, one who had 26 goals and 64 points last season.", "tiktoken_token_count": 921, "llama_token_count": 1116}]}, {"query": {"get_url": "https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?", "q": "Donald Trump", "from": "2023-06-28", "sort_by": "popularity"}, "articles": [{"source_name": "Lifehacker.com", "author": "Stephen Johnson", "title": "ikTok, Meta, Twitter, and YouTube All Have Different Plans for 2024 Election Misinformation", "description": "It\u2019s never easy to separate political speech from disinformation in a democracy built upon the right of free speech, but the firehose of foreign and domestic weaponized bullshit that began in 2016, reached a fever pitch in the aftermath of the 2020 presidenti\u2026", "url": "https://lifehacker.com/iktok-meta-twitter-and-youtube-all-have-different-pl-1850653781", "text": "It\u2019s never easy to separate political speech from disinformation in a democracy built upon the right of free speech, but the firehose of foreign and domestic weaponized bullshit that began in 2016, reached a fever pitch in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, and continued throughout the pandemic, saw social media companies at least giving it a shot.\n\n\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, however, many of the biggest players in the social media game are quietly (or loudly) reversing course on their previous moderation policies regarding misinformation and disinformation (the forming being false information spread mistakenly; the latter, maliciously). Perhaps the the advertising money and engagement that election year political speech brings are too tempting to pass up. Or maybe they\u2019re just really committed to free expression.\n\n\n\nBelow I\u2019ve laid out how five of the most influential social media platforms are walking the tightrope right now between providing a platform for free speech and allowing people to spread lies and conspiracy theories outright.\n\nWhat is Twitter\u2019s political misinformation policy?\n\nTwitter\u2019s policies regarding speech have changed drastically over the last few years. Before the October 2022 ascension of Elon Musk to CEO, Twitter was fairly locked down when it came to mis/disinformation. It banned political ads altogether in 2019. Policies against spreading lies about Covid and vaccines lead to the suspension of over 11,000 accounts during the early part of the pandemic. Controversial accounts like those of Kanye West and Donald Trump were banned even though they had millions of followers. Significantly, the service prevented the spread of links to a New York Post story about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop during the final weeks of the 2020 election, a move many considered a step too far.\n\nEverything is different now. Among the first things Elon Musk did upon taking control of Twitter was announce a policy of \u201cGeneral Amnesty\u201d for suspended users, overturning bans on thousands of accounts that promoted vaccine denial, general hate speech, bullying, and just about everything else. Twitter has partially reversed its 2019 ban on political advertising this year too, deciding to allow \u201ccause-based\u201d ads in the U.S. Musk does draw the line somewhere, though: Trump and Kanye may be free to tweet, but Alex Jones\u2019s Twitter account remains suspended.\n\nHow does YouTube deal with political speech?\n\nAnyone who has watched YouTube already knows the company has no problem accepting ads from politicians. But until recently, it prohibited content that called elections into question. In June, YouTube reversed its election integrity policy that pledged to prohibit \u201cfalse claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in certain past elections to determine heads of government. Or, content that claims that the certified results of those elections were false.\u201d\n\nYouTube\u2019s new policy acknowledges that removing this content curbed \u201csome misinformation\u201d but that it had \u201cthe unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm.\u201d Going forward, YouTube says it will \u201cstop removing content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in the 2020 and other past U.S. Presidential elections.\u201d Yay.\n\nHow does TikTok censor political views?\n\nTikTok is a frequent flashpoint for controversy, with concerns over the network\u2019s connection to China going so far as to trigger Congressional hearings. Whether Americans\u2019 data is safe from China is an open question, but TikTok has fairly strict policies regarding mis/disinformation. The company\u2019s \u201cintegrity and authenticity policy\u201d prohibits \u201cinaccurate, misleading, or false content that may cause significant harm to individuals or society, regardless of intent. Significant harm includes physical, psychological, or societal harm, and property damage.\u201d\n\nTo combat misinformation and disinformation of all kinds, TikTok says it employs a small army of fact-checkers from around the world; if they confirm content to be false, TikTok \u201cmay remove the video from our platform or make the video ineligible for recommendation into For You feeds.\u201d TikTok does not allow \u201cpaid political promotion, political advertising, or fundraising by politicians and political parties (for themselves or others)\u201d either.\n\nWhat is Facebook\u2019s policy on political ads and misinformation?\n\nSpeaking of political promotion, Meta\u2019s Facebook, the world\u2019s largest social media platform, is all over the place on the issue. After being identified as a primary source of foreign-funded disinformation in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Facebook threw up its hands and said \u201cenough\u201d after the polls closed in 2020. In an effort to combat \u201cforeign interference, misinformation and voter suppression,\u201d the company stopped accepting all political ads, an easy decision to announce after a presidential election. They have since instituted what looks like a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d policy around major U.S. elections: During the 2022 midterms, Facebook instituted a restriction period for \u201cads about social issues, elections or politics in the U.S.\u201d between Nov. 1\u2014Nov. 8, 2022 (election day). Whether the policy will stay in place for the 2024 elections remains to be seen.\n\nHow does Reddit moderate misleading political speech?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine what Reddit would look like if all of the misinformation it houses were removed. Reddit has no top-down comprehensive moderation policy concerning misinformation, and that\u2019s by design. Instead, individual users invent their own moderation policies for subreddits, with whatever rules they like. If a subreddit passes some unspoken line of egregiousness, actual Reddit employees step in and \u201cquarantine\u201d the offensive message board, i.e. remove it from search results. It could also be banned, but this is usually caused by violating anti-harassment policy as opposed to an anti lie-about-literally-anything policy.\n\nFor example, Reddit banned r/nonewnormal, a vaccination and Covid conspiracy subreddit in 2021, but not for lying or worsening an international pandemic. Instead, r/NoNewNormal was axed for \u201cbrigading\u201d other subreddits. Reddit\u2019s recent moves toward controlling how its unpaid moderators do their non-jobs may suggest a more heavy-handed, \u201cwe need advertising\u201d approach is forthcoming at the site.\n\nReddit does allow political ads, but promises it \u201cforbids deceptive, untrue, or misleading advertising, even among politicians.

The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has put a pause on Judge Terry A. Doughty's order that prohibits most federal officials from talking to companies like Meta about content. According to The New York Times, the three-judge panel has ruled for Doughty's preliminary injunction to be put aside \"until further orders of the court.\"\n\nIf you'll recall, the state attorneys general of Louisiana and Missouri filed a lawsuit against President Joe Biden and other top government officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci. They accused the current administration of pressuring social media companies to censor certain topics and remove content. The lawsuit, the Washington Post reports, is based on emails between the administration and social networks, wherein the former questioned the companies' handling of posts on their websites containing conservative claims on the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential elections, as well as anti-vaccine sentiments.\n\nDoughty, a Trump-appointed judge, said the plaintiffs \"produced evidence of a massive effort\" by the defendants \"to suppress speech based on its content.\" He also wrote in his decision that if the allegations are true, \"the present case arguably involves the most massive attack against free speech in United States history.\" His order prohibits federal agencies that include the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security from asking online platforms to take down content with \"protected free speech.\" They could still, however, communicate with those entities for issues related to criminal activity, national security and election interference by foreign players.\n\nConservatives have long believed that mainstream social media platforms are biased against right-wing ideologies. That had led to the launch of social networks associated with conservatives, such as Parler and Donald Trump's Truth Social. The state attorneys argued that federal officials crossed the line by threatening to take antitrust actions against social networks and to limit their Section 230 protections, which allow internet companies to moderate content on their platforms as they see fit. It's worth noting that former President Trump previously signed an executive order that sought to limit federal protections offered by Section 230 after Twitter fact-checked a false tweet he posted.\n\nThe Justice Department appealed Doughty's order the day after it was issued, arguing that it was too broad and could limit the government's ability to warn people about false information in times of emergency. Apparently, the administration has already felt its effects after its scheduled meeting with Meta to discuss strategies on how to counter foreign disinformation campaigns was cancelled. This stay will allow federal agencies to continue working with online platforms until the court can look further into the complaint. The appeals court has ordered for the case's oral arguments to be expedited so a final decision could be reached in the near future.", "tiktoken_token_count": 554, "llama_token_count": 645}, {"source_name": "The Verge", "author": "Makena Kelly", "title": "House GOP could try to hold Mark Zuckerberg in contempt of Congress", "description": "Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee may vote to hold Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in contempt of Congress for allegedly failing to comply to a subpoena request.", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/24/23806054/meta-mark-zuckerberg-contempt-congress-jim-jordan-go", "text": "Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee may vote to hold Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in contempt later this week, according to a new report from Punchbowl News Monday.\n\nThe potential contempt vote hinges on a February subpoena from the committee demanding Meta produce documents and communications related to content moderation discussions it has had with executive branch officials. Members of the committee have accused Meta of failing to cooperate with the investigation by withholding documents.\n\nSources told Punchbowl the committee plans to hold the vote on Thursday.\n\nResponding to the possible vote, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone directed The Verge to a statement the company gave to Fox Business saying that Meta had \u201cshared over 50,000 pages of documents\u201d and \u201cmade nearly a dozen current and former employees available to discuss external and internal issues\u201d in response to the committee\u2019s subpoena.\n\nThat clearly hasn\u2019t been enough for Republicans, who have used their newfound House majority to investigate coordination between the White House and tech companies to censor content since the 2020 election.

Jim Jordan (R-OH), chairman of the committee, told Punchbowl.\n\nDemocrats have pointed out that there is no law forbidding tech companies from collaborating with the government to find and remove harmful content, namely content falsely claiming that the 2020 presidential election was rigged or downplaying covid.\n\nThe GOP-led committee left Twitter out of the investigation, instead opting to support its new owner, Elon Musk, and the accusations he\u2019s helped raise in a series of reports called the \u201cTwitter Files.\u201d Shortly after purchasing the company last year, Musk gave a limited group of journalists access to select internal company documents describing moderation decisions related to Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop, \u201cshadowbanning,\u201d and former president Donald Trump\u2019s 2021 suspension.\n\nWhile the committee\u2019s subsequent hearings haven\u2019t amounted to more than saber-rattling, a federal judge recently issued a preliminary injunction banning Biden administration officials from making moderation requests of platforms.\n\nThe committee already escalated its fight with Meta last week in a letter to Zuckerberg suggesting that the company\u2019s new Threads platform \u201craises serious, specific concerns because it has been marketed as a rival of Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter, which has faced political persecution from the Biden administration following Musk\u2019s commitment to free speech.\u201d\n\nThe letter seems to be addressing an ongoing Federal Trade Commission investigation into Musk\u2019s acquisition of the company. Earlier this month, the committee brought FTC Chair Lina Khan in for a hearing that mostly focused on that probe and document requests it made of the company regarding its privacy and security practices.\n\nUp until the Trump administration, Congress rarely voted to hold contempt votes.

In the first year of the pandemic, the number of covid-related deaths was evenly dispersed among both Democrats and Republicans, but that quickly changed within a month after the vaccine became available to all U.S. adults.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study found the \u201cexcess mortality was significantly higher for Republican voters than Democratic voters after COVID-19 vaccines were available to all adults, but not before,\u201d noting that the death rate for Republican voters was 43% higher than for Democratic voters after the vaccine was widely available. However, the study notes that the data did not include whether the individual was vaccinated or if their deaths were directly linked to co vid-19, but researchers looked at the divide in political party-affiliated deaths between January 2018 and December 2021 and compared the pre-pandemic death rate to deaths recorded post-Covid vaccine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying that if you took someone\u2019s political party affiliation and were to change it from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party that they would be more likely to die from covid-19,\u201d the study\u2019s lead researcher Jacob Wallace told The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis study is not the first to reflect an increase in deaths following the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine, with KFF estimating in April of last year that at least 234,000 Covid deaths recorded between June 2021 and March 2022 could have been prevented if the individuals had received the vaccine. \u201cThese findings suggest that differences in vaccination attitudes and reported uptake between Republican and Democratic voters may have been factors in the severity and trajectory of the pandemic in the US,\u201d the study says.\n\nThe higher rate of Republican deaths has been widely attributed to misinformation and mistrust in official sources of information surrounding both the vaccine and the pandemic. Liz Hamel, the vice president of public opinion and survey research at the Kaiser Family Foundation told NPR in 2021, \u201cAn unvaccinated person is three times as likely to lean Republican as they are to lean Democrat.\u201d The NPR analysis found that people in counties that primarily voted for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election were three times as likely to die from c ovid-19 compared with those living in counties that leaned toward President Joe Biden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite Wallace and his team\u2019s findings, Florida Governor and presidential candidate Ron DeSantis continues to claim that Florida got it right when it came to its handling of the pandemic and filed a petition to investigate vaccine makers for fraud. He filed the petition to the Florida Supreme Court in December, alleging conspiracies about the scientific evidence that the vaccine is resistant to new variants. \u201cIt is impossible to imagine that so many influential individuals came to this view on their own,\u201d he wrote. \u201cRather, it is likely that individuals and companies with an incentive to do so created these perceptions for financial gain.\u201d\n\nThe rise in misinformation about Covid vaccines is still affecting the number of people who believe it is safe, with only 49% of Republicans reporting they are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d confident in the vaccine versus 88% of Democrats, according to a March study conducted by Stephen Neely at the University of South Florida.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on the Yale study, Neely told The Post the findings were important because they shed light on how a response to the Covid vaccine has shaped how the death toll played out. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most telling metrics I\u2019ve seen in how the politicization of the pandemic has played out in the real world,\u201d he said.", "tiktoken_token_count": 771, "llama_token_count": 981}, {"source_name": "BBC News", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "title": "Jared Kushner testifies in probe of Trump and the 6 Jan riots - reports", "description": "Donald Trump's son-in-law sat before a federal grand jury last month, US media report", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-66202405", "text": "Mr Trump has repeatedly claimed - with no evidence - that the 2020 election was rigged against him.

It\u2019s when we had our first date last year, in a Spanish restaurant in New York\u2019s Washington Heights. We\u2019d been chatting online, assessing each other and asking questions. When we met, I knew immediately that he was different. It was love at first sight. He\u2019s a wonderful guy, sincere and attentive. It\u2019s miraculous in some ways: Christopher is Chilean and only intended to come as a tourist, then we met and decided we have something special. We got married exactly a year to the day after we met.\n\nOur wedding at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau in City Hall, which is near the other New York courthouses, was supposed to be small and secretive, but it turned out to be more of a public event.\n\nI\u2019d known that Donald Trump\u2019s arraignment was coming because of the media hype, but I didn\u2019t really pay attention to it. We had no idea it was on the same day until an hour before our wedding. On our way to the ceremony, we bumped into someone we knew. He hugged me and said, \u201cHow strange that you\u2019re getting married on the same day that Trump is getting arraigned.\u201d In shock, I said: \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nIt was hard to process. I was getting wedding jitters, too. We began walking to the bureau and the crowds started building \u2013 it was right next to where Trump was to go to court. I thought, \u201cOh, God, we\u2019ve got to get to the church on time.\u201d When we got within three blocks, it was impassable. We couldn\u2019t get through the crowds because people were dancing with signs and playing Kool & the Gang\u2019s Celebration. It was really quite a scene, although I was disturbed by the number of Trump supporters there, saying he had already won the 2024 election and things like that. I am sensitive, so there was sadness as those words registered with me.\n\nAs we were about to go in to get married, Trump\u2019s motorcade arrived\n\nIt was supposed to be a three\u2011block walk, but ended up taking eight blocks because we had to detour around the barriers and the police. We were suited, had a bouquet of flowers and were running through the crowd, trying to get to the courthouse on time while constantly being congratulated and getting a lot of attention.\n\nI fed off the crowd\u2019s energy. As we were passing through, I saw a sign that read \u201cNo one is above the law\u201d. It made me think about how, because of same-sex marriage laws passed by the state in 2011, and then legalised across the country in 2015, Christopher and I were able to get married. We have laws to abide by, to honour and respect, but the court next door would soon hold a man who seems to have abused the law and manipulated it constantly.\n\nWe were getting married at 2pm and as we were about to go in, Trump\u2019s motorcade arrived. Before that it had felt like a celebratory street festival \u2013 despite the angry Trump supporters \u2013 but when he stepped out of the vehicle, the energy moved up a level; the crowds threw their arms in the air and yelled things like, \u201cThere is the big lie!\u201d\n\nI remember seeing the scaffolding on the courthouse; to me it represented the idea of being caged, in prison. But next to that, in the marriage bureau, there was joy, matrimony and union. By the time we left, he had left.\n\nWe did get to the wedding on time, despite the crowds, and couldn\u2019t hear the craziness outside. Christopher and I were there together holding hands, I was looking into his eyes, my hands shaking, and I thought, \u201cThis is what I want. This is the steadiness I\u2019m looking for, and this is love.\u201d\n\nInside, there were about 15 other couples waiting in line. We all smiled at each other \u2013 it was like we were all saying, \u201cThis is the day we\u2019re getting married?\u201d It was unreal.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

He has pursued a hard-right agenda, including signing a six-week abortion ban, loosening gun controls and attacking the teaching of race and LGBTQ+ issues in public schools.\n\nBut he has struggled to make an impact on the campaign trail, observers suggesting he lacks the skills to truly connect with voters, even in a Republican primary, let alone in a general election.\n\nOn Sunday, DeSantis told Fox News: \u201cThe media does not want me to be the nominee. I think that\u2019s very, very clear. Why? Because they know I will beat [Joe] Biden. But, even more importantly, they know I will actually deliver on all these things.\u201d\n\nHead-to-head polling shows Biden and DeSantis in a tight race. Recent surveys from Emerson and Yahoo News gave Biden leads of six and three points respectively. NBC News found the two men in a tie.\n\nDeSantis listed hard-right priorities he said he would pursue in power: \u201cWe will stop the invasion at the border. We will take on the drug cartels. We will curtail the administrative state. We will get spending under control.\n\n\u201cWe will do all the things that they don\u2019t want to see done, and so they\u2019re going to continue doing the type of narrative.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez was not convinced.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday to the former White House press secretary Jen Psaki, now an MSNBC host, she said: \u201cHe may be trying to win a base, but that base belongs to Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAnd he has sacrificed, I think, the one thing that others may have thought would make him competitive, which is this idea that he would somehow be more rational than Donald Trump, which he isn\u2019t.\u201d", "tiktoken_token_count": 592, "llama_token_count": 714}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Presented by Jonathan Freedland with Larry Sabato, produced by Joleen Goffin and the executive producer is Maz Ebtehaj", "title": "How would a possible third indictment affect Trump\u2019s 2024 run? \u2013 podcast", "description": "On Tuesday, Donald Trump said he had received a letter suggesting he was about to be indicted by special counsel Jack Smith in connection with the criminal investigation into the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021.

They were: obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and an unusual statute that makes it unlawful to conspire to violate civil rights.\n\nA federal grand jury investigating Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election has heard testimony from an aide who was with the former president for much of the day on 6 January 2021. William Russell was asked to appear on Thursday after making previous grand jury appearances. A data expert who worked on the 2020 election was also reportedly scheduled to appear before a grand jury.\n\nHouse speaker Kevin McCarthy has denied he privately promised Trump that he would get legislation passed that would erase Trump\u2019s two impeachments. According to a Politico report, in return for delaying an endorsement for Trump\u2019s 2024 president election, McCarthy pledged that he would get the House to vote to expunge both impeachments against the former president. The outlet said McCarthy had promised to do so before Congress leaves for an August recess.\n\nThe Democratic-led Senate judiciary committee voted to advance a supreme court ethics reform bill that would tighten financial disclosures and bolster recusal requirements for justices. The vote was along party lines, with Republicans adamantly opposed. The panel vote came after months of scrutiny on the court over ethical controversies supreme court justices have been involved in.\n\nConservative non-profit groups steered by the rightwing legal activist, Leonard Leo, reportedly orchestrated a $1.8m public relations campaign to defend and celebrate supreme court justice, Clarence Thomas, after he faced renewed scrutiny over his past misconduct claims.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr defended himself against accusations of racism and antisemitism at a hearing on alleged \u201cweaponization\u201d of the federal government. Kennedy provoked anger last week when he was filmed falsely suggesting that the coronavirus could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people. A report seen by the Guardian said Kennedy has a long history of racism, antisemitism and xenophobia.\n\nUpdated at 16.02 EDT\n\n20 Jul 2023 15.53 EDT Florida Governor Ron DeSantis backed Senator Tommy Tuberville\u2019s months-long blockade on military nominations over the Pentagon\u2019s abortion policy, saying that the policy would \u201cgo out the window\u201d if he became president. Asked by radio host Hugh Hewitt if he thinks Tuberville should release his hold, DeSantis replied: \u201cNo I don\u2019t.\u201d He added: The military\u2019s policy is not following US law. They are using tax dollars. They\u2019re funding abortion tourism, which is not an appropriate thing for the military to be doing. He said: Day one as commander-in-chief, that policy will go out the window. Tuberville, the Republican senator for Alabama, mounted his obstruction effort earlier this year. He is seeking the end of Department of Defense policy that provides paid time off and covers travel costs for servicewomen and dependents in need of abortion services. Tuberville\u2019s blockade has so far impacted nearly 300 military promotions, according to the Hill. The Pentagon has said more than 650 leadership positions could be vacant by the end of the year. Joe Biden and the US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said last week that the senator\u2019s hold is jeopardising US national security.\n\n\n\n20 Jul 2023 15.38 EDT Maya Yang Texas women who were denied abortions took the stand and delivered harrowing testimonies of their experiences of carrying life-threatening pregnancies as a result of the state\u2019s highly restrictive abortion laws. The women are part of a lawsuit filed in March by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is seeking clarification on which situations fall under the \u201cmedical emergency\u201d exception in Texas\u2019s abortion bans. The lawsuit appears to be the first of its kind where women who were denied abortions are suing a state since the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade last year. During Wednesday\u2019s hearing, plaintiff Samantha Casiano delivered an emotional testimony about being forced to give birth to a baby who died four hours later as a result of a fatal birth defect. Twenty weeks into her pregnancy, Casiano discovered that her baby had anencephaly, a rare condition in which parts of the baby\u2019s skull and brain are missing. Casiano said that doctors informed her that they were unable to perform an abortion in the state and that she was instead given funeral home information. \u201cI felt like I was abandoned,\u201d Casiano said. I had this funeral home paper and this is just supposed to be a scan day. Casiano went on to describe her thought processes upon learning about her baby\u2019s defect, telling the court that she considered getting an abortion out of state but was also afraid of losing her job or being jailed. She said: I felt like I was imprisoned in my own body. At one point, as Casiano read aloud a doctor\u2019s note about her high-risk pregnancy, she became overwhelmed and vomited during the hearing. Following a recess, Casiano returned to the stand and said that recalling the events \u201cjust makes my body remember, and it just reacts\u201d. She added: I now have a psychiatrist \u2026 I now vomit a lot more. I\u2019ve never vomited before like that, ever, before my pregnancy. My body\u2019s never reacted that way.

From Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney: NOTABLE: Woodward was reluctant to reveal this in open court. McFadden asked him if that was due to grand jury secrecy rules.

William Russell, a former White House aide who continued to work for Trump after he left office, was at a federal courthouse in Washington to testify before the grand jury convened by special counsel Jack Smith. Russell was asked to appear on Thursday after making previous grand jury appearances, the Washington Post reported. According to the paper, a data expert who worked on the 2020 election was also scheduled to appear before a grand jury. In addition, Smith\u2019s team are reportedly in the process of scheduling a grand jury appearance by Bernard Kerik, a former New York city police commissioner who worked with Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in the effort to overturn the election results.\n\n\n\n20 Jul 2023 14.54 EDT Senate committee approves new supreme court ethics rules The Democratic-led Senate judiciary committee voted to advance a supreme court ethics reform bill that would tighten financial disclosures and bolster recusal requirements for justices.

The legislation has little chance to make it through the full Senate and in a divided Congress.\n\n\n\n20 Jul 2023 14.35 EDT Donald Trump\u2019s court dates are set to clash with the Republican primary calendar. The former president faces three civil trials in New York, one to begin in October and two in January. The clash is raising extraordinary and unprecedented questions about the logistical, legal and political challenges of various trials unfolding against the backdrop of a presidential campaign, according to the New York Times. The paper cites Bruce Green, a Fordham University professor and former prosecutor, as saying: The courts will have to decide how to balance the public interest in having expeditious trials against Trump\u2019s interest and the public interest in his being able to campaign so that the democratic process works. That\u2019s a type of complexity that courts have never had to deal with before.\n\n\n\n20 Jul 2023 14.22 EDT Martin Pengelly In polling averages for the Republican primary, Donald Trump leads by about 30 points. He has maintained that lead even while facing 34 criminal charges in New York, over hush-money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels; 37 federal charges over his retention of classified documents; the prospect of state and federal indictments over his election subversion; a $5m fine after being held liable for sexual abuse and defamation against the writer E Jean Carroll; and ongoing investigations of his business affairs. Denying all wrongdoing, Trump has pleaded not guilty to all criminal charges. Nonetheless, polling regarding a notional general election shows him in a close race with Joe Biden. Earlier this week, Miles Taylor, who was a US homeland security official when in 2018 he wrote a famous anonymous New York Times column warning of Trump\u2019s unfitness for office, told the Guardian Trump could yet return to the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s been a number of polls that show the ex-president beating Joe Biden by several points,\u201d Taylor said. It would be hubris to say, \u2018Oh, no, we would beat him again a second time.\u2019 Actually, I don\u2019t think that. If the election was held today, I think Donald Trump would defeat Joe Biden, and that really concerns me. Taylor also pointed to the supine nature of the Republican party, saying McCarthy, the House speaker, \u201cthought Trump was a buffoon and a danger and I\u2019m sure Kevin still thinks that privately\u201d but is unwilling, or unable, to move in any way against him. Taylor said: Those people publicly, because they\u2019re afraid, are still supporting the man. That collective anonymity is putting us in pretty seriously great danger.\n\n\n\n20 Jul 2023 14.06 EDT Martin Pengelly Donald Trump faced a deadline of midnight on Thursday to say if he would appear before a Washington grand jury convened by the special counsel Jack Smith to consider federal charges over his election subversion and incitement of the attack on Congress on 6 January 2021. Late on Wednesday, citing two people familiar with the matter, the Guardian reported that prosecutors had assembled evidence to charge Trump with three crimes. They were: obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and an unusual statute that makes it unlawful to conspire to violate civil rights. Obstruction of an official proceeding is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Conspiracy to defraud the United States carries a maximum five-year sentence. The civil rights charge is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. By Thursday afternoon, all indications were that Trump would not agree to testify.\n\n", "tiktoken_token_count": 2459, "llama_token_count": 3052}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Hugo Lowell in Atlanta, Georgia", "title": "Georgia prosecutors eye criminal solicitation crimes in Trump inquiry", "description": "Exclusive: Fulton county DA has identified multiple state election crimes in the 2020 election investigation, sources sayThe Fulton county district attorney investigating Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia in recent weeks \u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/25/trump-georgia-investigation-fulton-county-prosecutors", "text": "The Fulton county district attorney investigating Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia in recent weeks has weighed several potential statutes under which to charge, including solicitation to commit election fraud and conspiracy to commit election fraud, according to two people briefed on the matter.\n\nThe move by the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, to identify a list of potential charges marks a major juncture in the criminal investigation and suggests prosecutors are on course to ask a grand jury to return indictments next month.\n\nAmong the state election law charges that prosecutors were examining: criminal solicitation to commit election fraud and conspiracy to commit election fraud, as well as solicitation of a public or political officer to fail to perform their duties and solicitation to destroy, deface or remove ballots, the people said.\n\nThe district attorney is also seeking to charge at least some of the Trump operatives who were involved in accessing voting machines and copying sensitive election data in Coffee county, Georgia, in January 2021 with computer trespass crimes, the two people said.\n\nThe outcome of deliberations, as well as the manner in which the statutes might be enforced, remains unknown. For instance, prosecutors could charge under certain statutes individually, fold them into a wider racketeering case of the kind that the Guardian has previously reported, or do a combination.\n\nProsecutors are expected to bring charges stemming from the Trump investigation at the start of August, a timeline inferred from the district attorney\u2019s instructions to her staff in May to work remotely during that period because of potential security concerns.\n\nThe grand jury that would decide whether to return an indictment against Trump or others was selected in mid-July. The selection process was attended by Willis and two prosecutors known to be on the Trump case: the deputy district attorney Will Wooten and special prosecutor Nathan Wade.\n\nA spokesperson for Willis did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nFor a criminal solicitation charge, prosecutors would have to show that Trump persistently requested another person to engage in certain illegal conduct that are \u201clikely and imminent\u201d as a result of the solicitation. The fact that the solicited acts were not carried out is not considered a defense.\n\nThe statute for soliciting a public officer to fail to perform duties could apply to Trump when he pressured the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to \u201cfind 11,780 votes\u201d, as well as his phone calls to chief investigator Frances Watson and the house speaker, David Ralston.\n\nThe threshold question there is whether Raffensperger would have failed to perform his duty as the state\u2019s top election official if he had done what Trump wanted, according to the Brookings Institution \u2013 for instance, if he actually went and \u201cfound\u201d 11,780 votes to reverse Trump\u2019s loss.\n\nThe statute for soliciting the tampering of ballots, meanwhile, could apply to Trump when he pressed Watson to go beyond protocol to go back \u201ctwo years, as opposed to just checking, you know, one against the other\u201d in conducting signature checks during ballot audits.\n\nThe critical issue in that call would come down to whether Trump was in effect asking Watson to use a non-standard method to invalidate legitimate ballots that he hoped would benefit him because it would whittle down the number of legitimate votes for Joe Biden, Brookings found.\n\nProsecutors are also expected to seek a criminal conspiracy charge, the people said. The conspiracy statute in Georgia is interpreted broadly, and the district attorney\u2019s office would only need to show that two or more people tacitly came to a mutual understanding to further a crime.\n\nTrump could have wide legal exposure under the conspiracy statute with prosecutors for months investigating whether Trump, his top lawyers and his campaign aides took steps they knew were illegal in replacing the legitimate slates of electors in Georgia with 16 fake Trump electors.\n\nThe district attorney\u2019s office has spent more than two years investigating whether Trump and his allies interfered in the 2020 election in Georgia, while prosecutors at the federal level are scrutinizing Trump\u2019s efforts to reverse his defeat that culminated in the January 6 Capitol attack.\n\nA special grand jury in Atlanta that heard evidence for roughly seven months recommended charges for more than a dozen people including the former president himself, its forewoman strongly suggested in interviews, though Willis will have to seek indictments from a regular grand jury.\n\nWillis originally suggested charging decisions were \u201cimminent\u201d in January, but the timetable has been repeatedly delayed after a number of Republicans who sought to help Trump stay in power as so-called fake electors accepted immunity deals as the investigation neared its end.", "tiktoken_token_count": 924, "llama_token_count": 1112}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Rich Tenorio", "title": "The Big Break: Ben Terris on his portrait of Washington after Trump", "description": "The Washington Post reporter discusses his tale of pollsters, chancers, gamblers and more in a capital rocked to its coreIf you were a pollster, would you ever bet on elections?

McElwee placed multiple bets on the midterms, including that Fetterman would lose. Fetterman\u2019s organization became displeased. Following its victory, it severed ties with McElwee. It was just the beginning of a dramatic downfall heightened by the pollster\u2019s connections to the pandemic-prevention advocate Gabe Bankman-Fried, whose billionaire brother Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto empire collapsed in scandal around election day.\n\nThe rise and fall of Sean McElwee is one of many storylines in a new book The Big Break: The Gamblers, Party Animals and True Believers Trying to Win in Washington While America Loses its Mind. For the author, the Washington Post reporter Ben Terris, the individuals he profiles tell a collective story about DC processing the fallout from the Trump years.\n\n\u201cNobody knew what the world was going to be like post-Trump,\u201d Terris says, adding: \u201cIf there is a post-Trump.\u201d\n\nTo explore that world, he turned to Democratic and Republican circles: Leah Hunt-Hendrix, an oil heiress turned funder of progressive causes, whose conservative grandfather HL Hunt was reportedly the world\u2019s wealthiest man; Matt and Mercedes Schlapp, a Republican power couple whose fortunes crested after Matt decided to stick with Trump in 2016; Ian Walters, Matt\u2019s protege until political and personal differences ruptured the friendship; Robert Stryk, a cowboy-hatted lobbyist who parlayed Trump connections into a lucrative career representing sometimes questionable clients; and Jamarcus Purley, a Black staffer for the Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein who lamented the impact of George Floyd\u2019s murder and the pandemic on Black Americans including his own father, who died. Disenchanted with his boss, Purley lost his job in disputed circumstances and launched an unconventional protest in Feinstein\u2019s Capitol office, after hours.\n\nTerris is a reporter for the Post\u2019s Style section, which he characterizes as strong on features and profiles. He can turn a phrase, likening Fetterman to \u201ca Tolkien character in Carhartt\u201d, and has an ear for the telling quote. Once, while Terris was covering the Democratic senator Jon Tester, from Montana, in, of all places, an organic pea field, nature called. A staffer asked: \u201cCan the senator\u2019s penis please be off the record?\u201d Terris quips that he\u2019s saving this for a title if he ever writes a memoir.\n\nHis current book is \u201csort of a travelog, not a memoir\u201d, Terris says. \u201cI tried to keep myself out of the book as much as I could. I wanted the reader to feel like they knew Washington, knew the weirdos, the odd scenes \u2026 the backrooms, poker games, parties.\u201d\n\nHunt-Hendrix\u2019s Christmas party is among the opening scenes. Attendees include her aunt Swanee Hunt, a former ambassador to Austria. Hunt-Hendrix aimed to make her own mark, through her organization Way to Win.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very progressive,\u201d Terris says, \u201ctrying to unwind a lot of projects, in a way, that her grandfather was all about. To me, it was fascinating, the family dynamics at play.\u201d\n\nJust as fascinating was her \u201cfiguring out how to push the [Democratic] party in the direction she believed it should go in \u2013 a more progressive direction than some Democrats pushed for. It told the story of Democratic party tensions \u2013 money and politics, the idea of being idealistic and also super-wealthy \u2026 All of these things made for a very heady brew.\u201d\n\nOn the Republican side, Stryk went from running a vineyard to savoring fine wine in a foreign embassy, thanks to his connection to Trump. Stryk joined the campaign in 2016. When Trump won, Stryk celebrated on a patio of the Four Seasons hotel in DC. A dog sniffed his crotch. When its owner apologized, Stryk found she worked for the New Zealand embassy, which was having difficulty reaching Trump. It was Stryk\u2019s lucky break.\n\n\u201cHe was in a position to connect New Zealand to Trump,\u201d Terris says. \u201cHe got a phone number and was off to the races, a sideshow guy making major deals \u2026 $5m with the Saudis, that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nWhen Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine last year, Stryk was in Belarus, exploring a potential relationship with that country\u2019s government. He had to make his way home via the Baltics.\n\n\u201cOne of the themes of the book is that the Donald Trump era allowed a bunch of sideshow characters to get out on the main stage,\u201d Terris says. \u201cStryk is a great example of that.\u201d\n\nOthers distanced themselves \u2013 eventually. Terris sees the rupture between Matt Schlapp and Ian Walters as illustrative. As head of the American Conservative Union, Schlapp presided over CPAC, the annual conservative conference, with Walters his communications director. As Schlapp welcomed fringe elements to CPAC \u2013 from Trump to Matt Gaetz to Marjorie Taylor Greene \u2013 Walters felt increasingly repelled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting tale of a broken friendship,\u201d Terris says. \u201cIt also helps the reader understand how did the Republican party get to where it is now \u2013 where are the fault lines, why one way over another.\u201d\n\nThe 2020 election was the point of no return. Schlapp stayed all-in on Trump, supporting his claim of a stolen election even in a graveside speech at the funeral of Walters\u2019s father, the legendary conservative journalist Ralph Hallow.\n\n\u201cWe have to take confidence that he would want us, more than anything else, to get beyond this period of mourning and to fight,\u201d Schlapp is quoted as saying. Walters and his wife, Carin, resigned from the ACU. Ian remained a Republican but marveled at the bravery of the whistleblower Cassidy Hutchinson in the January 6 hearings.\n\nAs for Schlapp, he faced scandal late last year. Assisting with the Senate campaign of the ex-football star Herschel Walker, when Schlapp arrived in Georgia, he allegedly groped a male campaign staffer.\n\nDonald Trump shakes hands with Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, at CPAC in 2020. Photograph: Yuri Gripas/Reuters\n\n\u201cI had to go back into my reporting and ask, were there signs of this?\u201d recalls Terris. \u201cCould I run through all of this [with] the alleged victim over the phone? I did. I ran a bunch of questions by Matt \u2013 he never answered.\u201d\n\nThere was another last-minute controversy. McElwee\u2019s polls proved inaccurate. Another red flag was his ties to Gabe Bankman-Fried, whose brother was arrested in December. Reports of McElwee\u2019s gambling made clients wonder where their money was going. Senior staff threatened to resign. McElwee stepped down.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, it was national news in a way I was not prepared for,\u201d Terris says.\n\nCan anyone be prepared for what comes next in Washington?\n\n\u201cDonald Trump proved you can win by acting like Donald Trump,\u201d Terris says. \u201cThere are a lot of people that learned from him \u2013 mostly in the Republican party, but [also] the Democratic party \u2013 how to comport yourself in Washington, what you can get away with. People\u2019s confidence is broken, politics is broken, relationships.\u201d\n\nCan it all be restored?\n\n\u201cNobody knows yet how to do it. It\u2019s not the same thing as normal. Maybe that\u2019s fine. Maybe normal led to Donald Trump.\u201d", "tiktoken_token_count": 1612, "llama_token_count": 1909}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Kira Lerner", "title": "\u2018Anger and radicalization\u2019: rising number of Americans say political violence is justified", "description": "Survey shows a small but significant share of Americans believe in use of force to attain political goals \u2013 on both the left and the rightThe June federal indictment of Donald Trump is \u201cradicalizing\u201d support for the use of force on behalf of the former presid\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/25/us-political-crisis-radicalizing-republicans-democrats-alike", "text": "The June federal indictment of Donald Trump is \u201cradicalizing\u201d support for the use of force on behalf of the former president and current presidential candidate, according to the author of a recent survey about threats to democracy.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, support for violence to restore the federal right to an abortion has also increased over the last few months, researchers found, although there\u2019s little indication that any organized groups support acting on this belief.\n\nThe Dangers to Democracy report indicates that a growing number of Americans support the use of political violence as the 2024 presidential campaign heats up and further indictments of Trump are probably imminent.\n\n\u201cThe indictment is radicalizing support for Trump, but that\u2019s not the only source of radicalization,\u201d said Robert Pape, a University of Chicago professor who led the research. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing growing anger and radicalization on the left as well.\u201d\n\nThe number of Americans who believe the use of force is justified to restore Trump to the White House increased by roughly 6 million in the last few months to an estimated 18 million people, according to the survey conducted by the university in late June and shared exclusively with the Guardian.\n\nOf those 18 million people, 68% believe that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump and 62% believe the prosecutions of Trump are intended to hurt his chances in 2024. An estimated 7% of Americans now believe violence could be necessary to restore Trump to the presidency, up from 4.5%, or 12 million people, in April.\n\nBut over the same period, Trump\u2019s general favorability slightly decreased among Republicans, the survey found.\n\nThe university\u2019s Chicago Project on Security & Threats (CPost) research center has been conducting Dangers to Democracy surveys of American adults on political violence and attitudes towards democracy since shortly after the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.\n\nThe most recent report marks the first increase in radical, violent support for Trump since April 2022, according to Pape, who directs CPost.\n\n\u201cThe public is more radicalized than it was in April and it\u2019s really quite significant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been tracking this quite a while, and this is a really big bump.\u201d\n\nStill, a radicalized public isn\u2019t enough for actual violence to occur, Pape said. He compared the support to kindling, but said Trump would have to give a speech or rally inciting people to act at a certain time to light the fire, as he did in Washington DC on 6 January 2021.\n\nDemocrats, however, expressed support for political violence for a different purpose. The survey found support for the use of force to coerce members of Congress to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d grew from 9% in January to 17% \u2013 an estimated 44 million Americans \u2013 at the end of June, with the sharpest rise among Democrats. Support for violence to restore the federal right to an abortion also increased during this time.\n\n\u201cThings are definitely heading in the wrong direction in terms of the radicalization of the country and we need to be aware of that because there were some hopes that the Trump indictment would actually reduce support for Trump,\u201d Pape said.\n\nSurvey respondents also said they view Trump as a bigger threat to democracy than President Joe Biden, with a difference of 52% to 33%.\n\nResearchers also asked participants about support for dangerous conspiracy theories, including whether they believe that a secret group of Satan-worshiping pedophiles is ruling the US government. The number of people who believe that statement \u2013 a major tenet of the QAnon conspiracy theory \u2013 increased slightly, although the change was not greater than the margin of error.\n\nThe survey also found that nearly 90% of Trump\u2019s most radical supporters believe the federal government is run by a \u201cdeep state\u201d of immoral people.\n\nWith more indictments of Trump likely to come in the next few weeks, both from the federal government and the Fulton county, Georgia, district attorney, Pape said he was concerned that further radicalization of the public is likely to occur.\n\nAs Trump faces more complicated legal trouble and the 2024 election season gets under way with the first GOP debate just one month away, the number of Americans who believe that the 2020 election was stolen from him remains largely unchanged at roughly 20%.\n\n\u201cThings are going in the wrong direction of radicalization, and we haven\u2019t even gotten into the really heated part of the 2024 election season,\u201d Pape said.\n\nCPost\u2019s research is supported by the University of Chicago, the Pritzker Military Foundation, the Hopewell Fund, and the Anti-Defamation League and contributions from the CPost board of advisers", "tiktoken_token_count": 952, "llama_token_count": 1110}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Chris McGreal in New York", "title": "Netanyahu and Trump: two desperate men exploiting power to save themselves", "description": "Israeli PM growing increasingly Trumplike in willingness to turn a personal crisis into a national one to stay in power and out of jailWhen Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to ensure his re-election four years ago, he turned to Donald Trump.Or, to be exact, to giant\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/27/netanyahu-and-trump-two-desperate-men-exploiting-power-to-save-themselves", "text": "When Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to ensure his re-election four years ago, he turned to Donald Trump.\n\nOr, to be exact, to giant billboards of the then US president putting on his least threatening smile as he shook hands with the Israeli prime minister, under the Hebrew caption: \u201cNetanyahu: in a different league\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s endorsement was a win for the man who has been Israel\u2019s prime minister longer than any other. The US president was popular with Israelis for thumbing his nose at longstanding Washington policies by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognising Israel\u2019s annexation of the Golan Heights. Trump\u2019s standing in Israel, at 71% approval for his handling of international affairs, was higher than in almost any other country.\n\nBut as much as many Israelis liked Trump, few foresaw the extent to which their own prime minister would prove as willing to turn a personal crisis into a national one in order to save his own skin.\n\n\u201cThe driving priority for both Trump and Netanyahu is their own personal interests,\u201d said Hadar Susskind, president of Americans for Peace Now, sister organisation to the Israeli peace movement. \u201cThe creation of this most extreme government in Israel\u2019s history was about keeping Netanyahu in power and hence out of jail.\u201d\n\nElection poster ahead of the 2019 general election, with the caption \u2018Netanyahu: in another league\u2019. Photograph: Oded Balilty/AP\n\nBoth men are in a fight to stay out of prison. Federal and state charges are stacking up against Trump; Netanyahu is in the middle of a corruption trial that has already lasted more than three years. And power gives the pair the best prospect of avoiding justice.\n\nTrump proved his willingness to launch populist attacks on the institutions of state throughout his presidency, culminating in his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election result and his part in rousing a mob to storm the Capitol. If he returns to power, Americans can expect a full-on assault on the independence of the judicial system and Department of Justice.\n\nNetanyahu has gone a different route by forging a coalition with some of the most extreme ultranationalist parties in Israel, even if he does not share some of their views, such as their hostility to LGBTQ rights. Their leaders are unashamedly racist about Arabs and open about their ambitions to annex some or all of the occupied territories, and make permanent the Israeli dominance over the Palestinians.\n\nThe coalition is pushing ahead with legislation to curb the power of Israel\u2019s judiciary that has prompted some of the biggest demonstrations in the country\u2019s history and a deep political crisis. The first stage passed on Monday, when Israel\u2019s parliament voted to limit the supreme court\u2019s ability to overturn laws.\n\nNetanyahu and his allies have a common interest in weakening the power of the courts. It gives him a chance of avoiding prison while removing what the far right fears will be a block on its ambitions for a Greater Israel.\n\nBut if Trump and Netanyahu are two desperate men hoping to exploit their power to save themselves at the expense of their countries, there are important differences. For a start, when Americans elected Trump as president in 2016, they knew exactly what kind of political leader they were getting \u2013 even if he proved more destabilising and seditious than some supporters expected.\n\nIn contrast, Aaron David Miller, who knows Netanyahu from his time as a US Middle East peace negotiator during several administrations, said the Israeli prime minister is not the same politician he was a few years ago.\n\nLegislation to curb the power of the judiciary has prompted some of the biggest demonstrations in Israel\u2019s history.

If the government feels the restrictions aren\u2019t enough, they can decide whether they still want to continue with the case.\n\nWhile Cipa established a mechanism through which the government can safely charge cases involving classified documents, the series of steps that have to be followed means it takes longer to get to trial compared with regular criminal cases without national security implications.\n\nCipa also requires the defense to review all classified materials and draft briefs in an ultra-secure room designed to handle secret documents called a sensitive compartmented information facility (Scif). If the only Scif is in Miami, just the back-and-forth travel could necessitate a slower schedule.\n\nThe prosecutors in the Trump case have indicated they want to get to trial quickly, but the complexities of Cipa and Trump\u2019s clear preference for delay \u2013 if he wins the election before it gets to trial, the case may be dropped \u2013 could significantly push back the government\u2019s proposed timetable.\n\nTo that end, the timetable amounts to more of a signal from prosecutors that they believe they would be ready to take the Trump case to trial before the end of the year, than a realistic schedule, since it will be subject to multiple hurdles, as identified by legal experts familiar with the process.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers can challenge the protective order for classified discovery by asking Cannon for an exemption \u2013 potentially to extend access to Trump himself. Photograph: Elizabeth Williams/AP\n\nCipa section 2: timings conference\n\nSection 2 requires the US district court judge Aileen Cannon, who is presiding over the Trump classified documents case in Florida, to promptly hold a hearing with prosecutors and the Trump legal team to establish a timetable for the discovery of classified materials and their use at trial.\n\nThe process was started on Monday when Cannon scheduled a hearing to take place on 14 July. That date suggests she will pursue a slower schedule than proposed by the government, which had sought to get the hearing done and start the discovery of classified documents by 10 July.\n\nCipa section 3: classified discovery\n\nJust like in any other case, the government is required to provide to the defense all materials they intend to use at trial \u2013 including the classified documents. Section 3 requires Cannon to issue a protective order governing the discovery of classified documents to the defense.\n\nThe protective order is the first hurdle because it needs to be blessed by Cannon before the government can start with the classified discovery. The Trump legal team may challenge the conditions of the protective order.\n\nTrump can challenge the protective order by asking Cannon for an exemption \u2013 potentially to extend access to the former president himself \u2013 according to an informal handbook for prosecutors known as the Justice Manual, which could delay the start of the classified discovery towards the end of July.\n\nIf Trump opposes DOJ's proposed CIPA protective order and Cannon permits full briefing on it that goes past the July 14 hearing, we're looking at our first significant delay from DOJ's proposed schedule.\n\n\n\nThey are negotiating it now, but if they can't agree, DOJ will file soon. \u2014 Secrets and Laws (@secretsandlaws) June 27, 2023\n\nCipa section 4: redactions in discovery\n\nSection 4 stipulates that Cannon can authorize the government to \u201cdelete specified items of classified information from documents to be made available to the defendant through discovery\u201d or to substitute the classified documents for \u201cunclassified summaries\u201d of the material.\n\nIt is unclear whether the government will file a section 4 motion. But if it does, that could prompt a challenge from the Trump legal team. If Cannon then agrees that Trump can have all the discoverable documents without restrictions, the government may seek an interlocutory appeal.\n\nIn its proposed timetable, the government gave itself a deadline of 14 August for a section 4 motion. Since that motion would govern the extent of the classified discovery, the Trump legal team may use it as a pretext to push back filing their section 5 notice (explained next).\n\nCipa section 5: notice from Trump\n\nAfter the classified discovery is complete, section 5 requires the Trump legal team to file a notice specifying the precise classified information they intend to disclose at trial, including a \u201cbrief description of the classified information\u201d.\n\nAccording to legal experts, the defense at this juncture typically files a notice that the government finds too vague \u2013 a problem because it reduces the notice to \u201cgraymail\u201d in writing \u2013 and the Trump legal team could do the same in this case.\n\nIn that event, the government would have to ask Cannon to force Trump to produce a more specific section 5 notice, pushing back the proposed deadline of 12 September multiple weeks after adding up the delays in section 4 and 5.\n\nCipa section 6(a): trial admissibility\n\nTwenty-one days after Trump\u2019s section 5 notice, the government has said it would be ready to file a motion asking Cannon to schedule a hearing under section 6(a) of the statute to adjudicate the relevance and admissibility of the classified information Trump wants to disclose at trial.\n\nThe government then suggests the Trump legal team get two weeks to file a response to the section 6 motion, for the government to get a week to file a reply to Trump\u2019s response, and for Cannon to schedule the hearing to come seven days after the government\u2019s reply.\n\nThe proposed timetable suggests the hearing takes place on 31 October, though earlier cumulative delays may push it back months, potentially to December.\n\nAt the hearing, Cannon would consider whether the Trump legal team needs the classified information that it outlined in its section 5 notice to make an effective defense against any potential objections from prosecutors who might want to limit the extent of the disclosure at trial.\n\nCannon would make a determination on each item of classified information. Her final ruling might not come down for days after the hearing, not least because she may choose to look through all of the classified documents and classified discovery herself to reach a decision.\n\nIf US judge Aileen Cannon rules that Trump can use the classified documents he wants at trial, the government can appeal to the 11th circuit appeals court.

If the appeals court also rules against the government, the attorney general must decide whether to continue the prosecution or drop elements of the case.\n\nThe proposed timetable from the government suggests a section 6 hearing on 5 December.

Trump and Nauta\u2019s lawyers are next due at a hearing before US judge Aileen Cannon on 14 July.\n\nFor weeks, Nauta had struggled to find a suitable Florida-based lawyer after he was forced to abandon his top choice over a dispute about legal fees and because of the need for any potential candidate to satisfy certain unique conditions, a person familiar with the situation said.\n\nThe conditions: an ability to gel with Nauta and his team, who had specifically not wanted a former prosecutor because of differences in style and strategy, such as not pressuring Nauta to take a plea deal.\n\nNauta was comfortable with Dadan, a former assistant public defender in the 19th judicial circuit in Florida who has limited federal trial experience but has argued cases before Cannon, and formally retained her the day before his rescheduled arraignment, the person said.\n\nNauta was charged by federal prosecutors earlier this month after he helped Trump remove boxes out of a storage room at the Mar-a-Lago club before Trump\u2019s lawyer could search them for classified documents demanded by a grand jury subpoena, according to the indictment.\n\nThe steps Trump took to have those boxes removed from the storage room, an episode now at the heart of the obstruction charge, caused former Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran to certify a false certification to the justice department confirming that no further documents were at the property, the indictment said.\n\nSeparately, according to the indictment, Nauta lied to the FBI when he allegedly said he was unaware about how boxes of classified documents were taken to Trump\u2019s residence before Trump agreed to return 15 boxes to the National Archives in January 2022.\n\n\u201cWhen asked whether he knew where Trump\u2019s boxes had been stored, before they were in Trump\u2019s residence and whether they had been in a secure or locked location, Nauta falsely responded, \u2018I wish, I wish I could tell you.

They were there on behalf of the centrist political advocacy organization No Labels, which is considering fielding a third-party ticket in the 2024 presidential election, and had enlisted the two men to debut its 67-page policy manifesto.\n\nEarly on in the evening, the moderator asked the question looming over the event: were Manchin and Huntsman running for president? After a smattering of applause died down, Manchin deflected, saying they were simply there to \u201cexplain to you that we need options\u201d. But Manchin\u2019s refusal to announce whether he will seek re-election for the US Senate next year, and his presence at the town hall, has drawn speculation that he and No Labels may combine to upend the 2024 election.\n\nNo Labels has been around since 2010, largely promoting centrist policies and occasionally working to elect moderate Democrats to Congress. Its recent ambitions are far grander, as it plans to raise $70m, get on the ballot in every state across the country, and build a third-party ticket for the presidency. The group has become a specter looming over the 2024 election for Democrats, with polls showing that a centrist third-party candidate would draw votes away from Joe Biden and tilt the race toward Donald Trump.\n\nThe growing prominence of No Labels and its potential to run a third-party candidate has resulted in backlash from Democrats and more centrist Republicans as a result. Democratic representatives and political organizations such as MoveOn have mobilized to oppose the group, including holding briefings for congressional staffers on the risk of a third-party ticket. Democratic and Republican strategists additionally commissioned a poll that showed how an independent centrist candidate would act as a spoiler against Biden.\n\nBut efforts to show that No Labels could take a significant portion of the vote and effectively hand Trump the presidency have only emboldened the group. No Labels\u2019 chief pollster told Axios that the recent survey \u2013 which showed a moderate independent candidate would receive around 20% of the vote and shift the election to Trump \u2013 was proof that their strategy was sound and that they had a viable chance at the presidency.\n\n\u201cThe people who are spearheading this are not doing it cynically. They have convinced themselves that this is a unique historical moment and they intend to seize it,\u201d said William Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who co-founded No Labels in 2010 before leaving it earlier this year.\n\nGalston disagreed with the group\u2019s decision in 2022 to focus on fielding a third-party candidate, he said, and after a year of offering arguments against the shift decided to quit the organization in April of this year. Although he still supports the group, he sees its current mission as misguided and has spoken out about how it\u2019s likely to benefit Trump\u2019s presidential hopes.\n\nDonald Trump at the Turning Point Action USA conference in West Palm Beach, Florida last Saturday. Photograph: Giorgio Viera/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI could not go along with the formation of an independent ticket,\u201d Galston said. \u201cI saw no equivalence between Donald Trump and Joe Biden and feared that this ticket would, on net, draw support away from Biden\u2019s candidacy.\u201d\n\nNo Labels, and its potential candidate Manchin, reject the notion that they will act as spoilers. The group has claimed it will not go ahead with its plans if it appears to shift the election to one party, though has been vague on its criteria for such a decision, and Manchin on Monday told the audience in New Hampshire that \u201cif I get in a race I\u2019m gonna win\u201d.\n\nUndisclosed donors\n\nAs No Labels moves forward with its fundraising and attempts to get on nationwide ballots, it has faced increased scrutiny over who exactly is backing their efforts. The group refuses to disclose its donors, which it is not obligated to do, but a Mother Jones investigation identified dozens of wealthy contributors affiliated with No Labels.\n\nAlthough it includes several major Democratic donors, many of the contributors favor conservative causes and Republican candidates. A separate investigation from the New Republic found that conservative billionaire Harlan Crow, most recently known for his close ties with the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, donated $130,000 to the group between 2019 and 2021.\n\nNo Labels officials have cited privacy concerns as the reason that the group will not release its donors, while its chief executive, Nancy Jacobson, told NBC News this week that there was \u201cnothing nefarious\u201d about its fundraising. Galston brought up to Jacobson in the early days of the group\u2019s operations that a lack of transparency might become an issue, he said, but she told him \u201cin no uncertain terms\u201d that was how things would be run.\n\nJacobson and No Labels did not respond to a request for comment on this article.\n\nIt is unclear just how much of its $70m goal No Labels has raised, although previous years and Jacobson\u2019s status as veteran fundraiser show that it is able to draw large sums. No Labels\u2019 2021 tax forms, the most recent year publicly available, state that it took in just over $11.3m in revenue that year. The organization\u2019s highest-paid staffer was the former political commentator Mark Halperin, according to the 2021 tax form, who made about $257,000 as No Labels\u2019 chief strategist. The organization hired Halperin despite allegations from multiple women of sexual harassment and assault against the once-prominent journalist. Halperin, who has previously apologized for some of the harassment allegations against him while denying other allegations including physical assault, left No Labels in March of this year. He could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe tax forms also show that No Labels paid top Democrat-run consulting firms for their advocacy and communications work. It gave around $946,000 in compensation to the communications firm Rational 360 in 2021. Rational 360 did not respond to a request for comment on this article.\n\nThe group has faced criticism from Democrats before, including when it endorsed an anti-LGBT, anti-abortion Illinois congressman during the 2018 midterms. A Super Pac tied to No Labels spent about $1m backing the campaign, according to the Intercept. But previous backlash against the group is nothing compared towithwhat it currently faces, with growing concern among Democrats that No Labels has the potential to lose them the White House.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that a No Labels candidate would help re-elect Donald Trump,\u201d the Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen told the Hill.\n\nNo Labels has given itself until Super Tuesday \u2013 when a large number of states hold primaries in early March of next year \u2013 as a deadline for announcing whether or not it will run a third party. The group\u2019s national co-chair Pat McRory stated on Monday that if Biden and Trump are the likely match-up by then and the group sees a path to victory, it will run a candidate.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1420, "llama_token_count": 1725}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Lloyd Green", "title": "Unafraid review: Kari Lake as election denier, birther \u2026 and Trump VP?", "description": "The former TV host refuses to accept Arizona defeat, spews hate against LGBTQ+ Americans and idolizes the ex-presidentDonald Trump never won the popular vote.

In didn\u2019t quite work out that way.\n\nMeadows wrote that Trump tested positive for Covid several days before the first 2020 debate.

Revenge is best served cold.\n\nLike her idol, Lake is simultaneously embittered and energized by the electorate\u2019s rejection. The pair occupy the same wavelength. Reality is an inconvenience.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Kari Lake on 8 November 2022 is one of the most egregious cases of \u2018highway robbery\u2019 in any state\u2019s history,\u201d Trump thunders on the page. \u201cKari Lake\u2019s story does not end in defeat, because she is just getting started!\u201d\n\nLake also harbors ambitions for the US Senate seat held by Kyrsten Sinema.\n\nUnafraid is bile-filled and breezy. Introspection takes a holiday. Lake trashes high-profile LGTBQ+ Americans, embraces Paul Gosar of Arizona, one the most extreme and incendiary members of the Republican party \u2026 and demands national unity.\n\n\u201cCongressman Gosar is \u2018the GOAT\u2019. We need strong, America First Patriots like Gosar at every level of government.\u201d\n\nFor the record, among countless controversies, Gosar has publicly defended Nick Fuentes, the white supremacist and neo-Nazi who dined with Trump and Ye, the recording artist formerly known as Kanye West.\n\nPredictably, Lake holds the left responsible for America\u2019s divide.\n\nShe also delivers a shoutout to Karl Olsen, her \u201chero and attorney\u201d. Olsen has reportedly caught the attention of Jack Smith, the special counsel, and not in a good way. In Lake\u2019s eyes, Olsen \u201cis dedicating his life to saving our Republic\u201d. According to Politico, he sits amid a rogue\u2019s gallery: \u201cAmong those under a microscope for their roles in orchestrating a scheme of fake electors are Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Kurt Olsen, Kenneth Chesebro and Jeffrey Clark, with investigators homing in on whether they \u2018were following specific instructions from Trump or others, and what those instructions were\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn May, the Arizona supreme court fined Olsen and two other lawyers for making \u201cfalse factual statements to the court\u201d, wrote the chief justice, Robert Brutinel, a Republican. \u201cSometimes campaigns and their attendant hyperbole spill over into legal challenges. But once a contest enters the judicial arena, rules of attorney ethics apply.\u201d\n\nLake does nothing to mask her antipathy toward Biden and gay, lesbian and transgender members of his administration. She singles out Pete Buttigieg, Biden\u2019s transportation secretary, and Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, for particular opprobrium.\n\nButtigieg, she writes, \u201ccouldn\u2019t even fix the potholes in South Bend, Indiana\u201d, where he was mayor, but became \u201ctransportation secretary just because he was gay\u201d.\n\nThe fact he won the Iowa caucus in 2020 and tied Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire apparently escaped her gaze. Lake also forgets that Buttigieg\u2019s March 2020 exit from the Democratic primary helped pave the way to Biden taking down Sanders. Buttigieg also spent seven months in Afghanistan as a navy lieutenant, by the by.\n\nOnce upon a time, Lake hosted a drag show in her own house. Her daughter attended. Consistency is not Lake\u2019s strength. She tags Barack Obama with the birther smear, deriding him as a man with a \u201cmysterious past\u201d who engaged in \u201cflirtations with Marxism\u201d. But she omits that she donated to Obama in 2008 and reportedly campaigned for him while a broadcaster, in violation of journalistic ethics.\n\nIndeed, Lake contributed to Obama\u2019s campaign shortly after National Journal ranked him as the most liberal senator. His liberalism wasn\u2019t a negative for Lake, until it was. The line between conviction and convenience is often blurry.\n\nLake ponders the question of whether Trump on the debate stage was an \u201casshole\u201d or simply a jerk. She concludes the latter.\n\n\u201cTrump was an expert at walking that tightrope,\u201d she explains.\n\nHeading into election season, Arizona is one of four true swing states, according to the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. Last time, Biden eked out a win in the Grand Canyon state by 0.4% and fewer than 11,000 votes. Two years later, Lake lost the governor\u2019s race to Katie Hobbs by 0.6% and 17,000 votes.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Arizona remains a crucial battleground.

Jean Carroll was part of the \u201cpolitical Witch Hunt\u201d he faces while campaigning for the presidency as a Republican.\n\nThe justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCarroll, 79, sued Trump, 77, for defamation months after he vehemently denied her claims first made publicly in a 2019 memoir that a chance encounter between the pair at a Bergdorf Goodman store began with flirtations but ended in a violent encounter inside a dressing room in a desolate section of the store.\n\nThe progression of the lawsuit, filed in 2020, was delayed for three years as an appeals court considered claims by Trump and the justice department that he was protected from liability for remarks he made while president. When Joe Biden became president, the justice department did not change its position.\n\nBut the department said in a letter to a Manhattan federal judge on Tuesday that circumstances have changed since it made its original recommendation and it no longer believes Trump can claim that his comments about Carroll were carried out as part of his official duties as president.\n\nIt noted that a court in Washington had recently further defined when a president is immune from civil lawsuits, and it cited a federal jury\u2019s $5m award to Carroll in May after finding that Trump had sexually abused and defamed her, though he didn\u2019t rape her. It also considered that the lawsuit has been updated with remarks Trump made about Carroll\u2019s claims after leaving the presidency.\n\nIn three posts Wednesday on Truth Social, Trump offered fresh support for claims he made about Carroll that led the jury to conclude he had defamed her.\n\n\u201cThe statements that I made about Carroll are all true.

That was the word he hid behind in writing a damning essay in the New York Times from inside Donald Trump\u2019s White House and a subsequent book.\n\nToday, Taylor is speaking openly to anyone who will listen. The 35-year-old conducts part of a phone interview with the Guardian while boarding a flight from Chicago to north-west Michigan. At one point he breaks off to make sure two fellow passengers get to sit together. With the grateful couple safely ensconced, Taylor carries on talking. What if his unvarnished views on the former president trigger a display of Maga air rage?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my experience the past couple of years that when someone notices you and they come over and say, \u2018Are you such and such person?\u2019, you don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to be someone who says thank you for what you did or someone spits in your face and tries to punch you. So yeah, I try to lower my voice in public.\u201d\n\nEven so, Taylor has proudly attached his name to a second book, Blowback: A Warning to Save Democracy from the Next Trump, which combines raw politics with uncomfortable disclosures from his own life. Showing the zeal of a convert, the man who for a time was at the centre of the biggest mystery in Washington has become an apostle of radical transparency. With Trump once again charging towards the White House and vowing revenge, Taylor sees the cloak of anonymity he once embraced as a fundamental threat to democracy.\n\nTaylor insists he hates politics but was inspired to work in government after the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. He started in the George W Bush administration and was a senior aide on Capitol Hill. After Trump\u2019s election he joined the homeland security department, eventually becoming chief of staff to the secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nIn September 2018, Taylor wrote his column in the Times, under the headline \u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration\u201d. The article made public what cabinet members were saying in private: Trump was unstable and unfit.\n\nGuessing the identity of the author became a Washington parlour game, with Trump demanding the Times unmask him (\u201cTREASON?\u201d he tweeted). Taylor quit the administration and followed up with a book, A Warning, attributed to \u201cAnonymous: A Senior Trump Administration Official\u201d, another chronicle of incompetence and malevolence in the White House.\n\nYet he was finding the secrecy an unbearable burden and, after much agonising, unmasked himself in October 2020.\n\nHe recalls: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously very ironic coming from me but, in the aftermath of all of that, I came to the conclusion that the biggest threat to our democracy was anonymity.\n\n\u201cThe people who most needed to come forward and tell the truth were cowed into silence, including me. I thought anonymously sounding the alarm about the president would draw attention to the message instead of the messenger and always intended to unveil myself. But in the aftermath I realised I really should have done that a lot sooner both for political reasons and personal reasons.\u201d\n\nPolitically, he believes, coming forward sooner would have given more people cover to do the same. When Taylor went public ahead of the 2020 election, it proved helpful in recruiting what would be the biggest alliance of ex-officials in US history to campaign against the president who appointed them.\n\n\u201cBut then personally, the living two lives was an enormous stressor on my psyche and my life. The pressure to come forward or not? Frankly, at the core of it, the reason why I delayed was fear and, as I dove deeper into myself, it felt like cowardice because I saw what happened to people who went against Trump. While I convinced myself, \u2018Look, you\u2019re going to unmask yourself eventually,\u2019 I was hesitant in that time after the publication of the op-ed and the book, because I didn\u2019t want my life ripped to shreds. But ultimately, I felt I really had to do that,\u201d he says.\n\nTo manage anxiety attacks, Taylor abused alcohol and prescription drugs. He was hospitalised after overdosing on caffeine, alcohol, marijuana and Xanax, at levels that had killed other patients. After revealing his identity, he received death threats, took on a bodyguard and was forced to shuttle between safe houses.\n\nTaylor now writes: \u201cThe public fight against Donald Trump cost me my home, my job and savings, friendships, a relationship, and my family\u2019s security, temporarily putting me on the run. Late one evening in a Virginia high-rise, it also nearly cost me my life.\u201d\n\nThis last point is a reference to how, alone with a gun on election night in 2020, Taylor contemplated shooting himself. Now, sober for nearly 18 months, he sees the experience as metaphor for the US in the Trump era.\n\nThe flirtation with putting another hyper-populist far-right person in the White House is effectively civic suicidal ideation\n\nHe says: \u201cThe ways that we individually, if we ignore our guardrails, can end up causing ourselves to drift towards self-destruction and similarly, as a democracy, ignoring those guardrails is effectively suicidal ideation. That\u2019s what we are as a country grappling with right now.\n\n\u201cThe flirtation with putting another hyper-populist far-right person in the White House is effectively civic suicidal ideation. In the course of writing this, the personal guardrails being ripped off in my life looked an awful lot like what\u2019s happening right now where our collective silence, at least in the Republican party, about this guy is leading us potentially towards self-destruction.\n\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t people sounding the alarm but, by and large, the leading figures of the Republican party refuse to repudiate this man and continue to support him. We are doing this again, even though those people say privately he\u2019s a threat.\u201d\n\nTaylor accompanies Kirstjen Nielsen, then homeland security secretary, in a meeting in Honduras in March 2018. Photograph: Tim Godbee/AP\n\nTaylor offers the example of Kevin McCarthy, the House speaker whom Taylor used to meet weekly.\n\n\u201cHe thought Trump was a buffoon and a danger and I\u2019m sure Kevin still thinks that privately. Those people publicly, because they\u2019re afraid, are still supporting the man. That collective anonymity is putting us in pretty seriously great danger.\u201d\n\nIn November 2020, the journalist Carl Bernstein listed 21 Republican senators he said had \u201crepeatedly expressed contempt\u201d for Trump. Many Republicans on Capitol Hill have confided in reporters about such disdain, generating countless stories. But few ever go on the record. Taylor talked to many of them for his book.\n\n\u201cSome of the people who were incredibly critical of me for publishing anonymous critiques of the president are the same people who when I interviewed them, asked that I not use their names so that they could speak candidly. They asked if they could be anonymous in the book. You can\u2019t even make that shit up: that\u2019s insane hypocrisy,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAnd after I submitted to the publisher, I went back to some of these people multiple times and said, \u2018I really think you should consider letting me put you on the record here. Let\u2019s make this an opportunity for you to be on the record pushing back against this.\u2019 \u2018Oh, no, no, no, no. It doesn\u2019t make sense right now. I\u2019m better positioned in my job in Congress or within the party to steer the direction.\u2019\n\n\u201cTo them I would say: I thought the same thing and was completely fucking wrong because we weren\u2019t able to steer in the right direction. Look, you guys aren\u2019t having an effect. He\u2019s still dominating. Stop fooling yourselves. The best impact you can have will be to speak out from within the tribe because it is air cover for other people to do the same. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re sleepwalking back into the exact same mistakes we made last time and that\u2019s why I called this Blowback.\u201d\n\nOn or off the record, Taylor\u2019s sources shared horror stories to add to his own. Trump allegedly sought to tap aides\u2019 phones in an attempt to catch leakers. He was said to have viewed military veterans as \u201clazy malingerers\u201d and planned to destroy the $250bn veterans\u2019 social safety net so he could spend the money elsewhere. He put his own government on edge about the prospect of nuclear war.\n\nTaylor recalls: \u201cOfficials were so worried that the president would accidentally lead us into a nuclear war with North Korea that, for the first time in the history of the Department of Homeland Security, we convened every single leader to talk through actual real-life preparations for what we might have to do if we ended up in a nuclear conflict with another nation state. I will tell you that, in the wake of those preparatory meetings, I felt like we were woefully unprepared as a country to enter that type of conflict, which made it all the more reckless that Trump was being so bellicose with regard to the North Koreans.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Guardian Headlines US Free newsletter For US readers, we offer a regional edition of our daily email, delivering the most important headlines every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Aides mused about using American firepower against helpless migrants.\n\nTaylor writes: \u201cOn the flight back to Washington DC, Trump adviser Stephen Miller took a seat next to me to float an idea. Across from us at a small table sat the commandant of the coast guard, Adm Paul Zukunft. \u2018Admiral, the military has aerial drones, correct?\u2019 Stephen inquired. \u2018Yes,\u2019 Zukunft replied. \u2018And some of those drones are equipped with missiles, correct?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Sure,\u2019 the commandant answered, clearly wondering where the line of questioning was going. \u2018And when a boat full of migrants is in international waters, they aren\u2019t protected by the US constitution, right?\u2019 \u2018Technically, no, but I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re getting at.\u2019 \u2018Tell me why, then, can\u2019t we use a Predator drone to obliterate that boat?\u2019 Adm Zukunft looked nonplussed. \u2018Because, Stephen, it would be against international law.\u2019\u201d\n\nAll of it, Taylor warns, would be far worse under \u201cTrump 2.0\u201d, with guardrails gone and third-rate officials in place. Taylor fears Trump could use secret powers known by national security officials as \u201cthe doomsday book\u201d to manipulate elections and satisfy his authoritarian impulses.\n\nHe says: \u201cThe aides that guarded that book were concerned about the president reading it, or Maga allies around him getting ahold of it, because especially towards the end of the administration, they witnessed the president\u2019s proclivity to abuse his authorities for political purposes, and especially as he started to signal that the 2020 election might be stolen or he could be cheated, those same people were concerned about Trump realising he had even more extraordinary powers than he knew and that he might potentially use those to cement a coup.\u201d\n\nThe US dodged a bullet: the doomsday book almost fell into the hands of Christina Bobb, a Trump lawyer, election denier and former host on the far-right One America News Network.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that she would have taken the doomsday book to Trump and said, \u2018Wait a second, look at all of the classified emergency powers we could use to make sure that power is not transferred to Joe Biden.\u2019 That\u2019s pretty terrifying,\u201d Taylor says.\n\n\u201cIn a second term, Trump will be very much aware that exists and I suspect from day one they\u2019ll want to get their hands on it and see what tools we in the American public aren\u2019t aware of that they could use to further cement a hold on power and disrupt the political process.\u201d\n\nIn Blowback, Trump\u2019s vulgar sexism also comes under scrutiny. Taylor recounts how the president made lewd comments about his own family members. He writes: \u201cAides said he talked about Ivanka Trump\u2019s breasts, her backside, and what it might be like to have sex with her, remarks that once led [then chief of staff] John Kelly to remind the president that Ivanka was his daughter. Afterward, Kelly retold the story to me in visible disgust. Trump, he said, was \u2018a very, very evil man.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump was not beyond \u201clocker room talk\u201d at national security meetings. Taylor says: \u201cHe would critique women about their looks on their television appearances and their bodies, including my own boss, Kirstjen Nielsen, at one point, and that was incredibly off-putting. There\u2019s an anecdote I tell in the book about him joking about [press secretary] Sarah Sanders\u2019 weight.\n\nI\u2019ve got to think that people who are still hardcore supporters of Trump\u2019s will at least draw the line at incest fantasies\n\n\u201cBut the comments about his own daughter were the most disgusting. I debated actually whether to even include those anecdotes in the book because they are so graphic and disgusting. But I\u2019ve got to think, or hope at least, that people who are still hardcore supporters of his, who\u2019ve stuck with him through impeachments and indictments, will at least draw the line at incest fantasies.\n\nIvanka Trump speaks at a campaign event while her father, Donald Trump, watches in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Photograph: Morry Gash/AP\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s got to be a point that you just decide, no matter how much you like someone\u2019s policies, that their character is so vile that you can\u2019t support them. So I ultimately decided to put that in there to talk about his misogynistic behaviour because I think it\u2019s reflective of the way he conducts himself as commander-in-chief. You can\u2019t firewall those two things from each other. He can\u2019t be a disgusting person in his private life and a paragon virtue in his public life. That doesn\u2019t exist. Those private behaviours lead to public danger.\u201d\n\nThat much should have been clear in 2016, when the public learned of the Access Hollywood tape, on which Trump boasted about grabbing women\u2019s genitals, and elected him anyway. He has always been the opposite of anonymous, a celebrity flaunting his vices in plain sight. Taylor thinks 2016 might be happening again.\n\nTaylor says: \u201cThere\u2019s been a number of polls that show the ex-president beating Joe Biden by several points. It would be hubris to say, \u2018Oh, no, we would beat him again a second time.\u2019 Actually, I don\u2019t think that. If the election was held today, I think Donald Trump would defeat Joe Biden, and that really concerns me.\u201d\n\nTaylor proposes harsh medicine few Democrats would be willing to swallow: a coalition with moderate Republicans, perhaps even with the former congresswoman Liz Cheney replacing Kamala Harris as Biden\u2019s running mate.\n\n\u201cThe single best jump to beat Trump is a unity coalition that Biden would undertake to form. He talked a lot about bringing Republicans into his administration in the first term. Not a whole lot came in. He needs to bring someone to the top of the ticket to show he would govern for the first time in American history as a unity president with a unity administration. That\u2019s maybe his only shot to decisively beat Donald Trump,\u201d he says.\n\nTaylor\u2019s plane is about to take off. After celebrating his father\u2019s 80th birthday in Michigan, he will head to a memorial service for a family member who died at 95.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking heart in the fact that I\u2019ve got family members that are living so long,\u201d he says, philosophically. \u201cHopefully that means something for me. The stupid situation that I keep putting myself in in going against these political crazies probably is not terribly good for my lifespan.

There are the texts between various Trump underlings and Walt Nauta, the Trump body man who has also been indicted, showing the president directing his employees to move the boxes containing classified information back and forth to various locations around his properties in Palm Beach and Bedminster, New Jersey. There is the annoyed missive from Trump\u2019s wife Melania, trying to make sure the boxes don\u2019t crowd out room for her luggage on a private plane. There is the claim from Trump\u2019s former attorney, compelled to testify against him in an unusual arrangement, that the former president suggested, with a Grinch-like pinching gesture, that the lawyer destroy confidential documents to prevent them from being produced in a subpoena. There is a text message Nauta sent to another Trump underling, showing a box having fallen over in a storage room at Mar-a-Lago, secret documents spilling on to the floor \u2013 whoops.\n\nWhat there is not, conspicuously, is a motive. Over the course of more than a year following his departure from office, it appears that Trump spent considerable effort and resources in transporting the documents with him and keeping them near at hand \u2013 and that later, as the federal government began to demand the boxes back, that he then went out of his way to keep and conceal them, going to great length, sparing no expense, and ultimately breaking the law so much that he incurred himself a series of felony charges. Anyone can tell you how this behavior is typical of Trump: how it reflects his pettiness, his contempt for the law, his willingness to sacrifice and endanger others. What no one can tell you is why he did it.\n\nIt would be more convenient \u2013 legally, for Jack Smith and his prosecutors, and politically, for Joe Biden, for the Democrats, and for the growing number of Republicans who are looking to challenge Trump in the 2024 Republican primary \u2013 if we could say precisely why Trump wanted to keep the documents so badly, exactly what he wanted them for. It would be very easy to make a case to a skeptical jury \u2013 or to a divided American people \u2013 that Trump was a danger and could not be trusted with national secrets again if it could be said that he wanted to keep the documents for any of the straightforwardly dangerous and nefarious reasons that have been speculated: if he was seeking to sell national security secrets to the Saudis, say, or to Israel; if he was hoping, as some have suggested, that he one day might be able to blackmail someone powerful, like the president of France.\n\nIt\u2019s very possible that Trump had concocted such a plan. There is much that we do not know about the investigations into Trump, including about the special counsel\u2019s query into his illegal document retention. But we do know that in the past, we know that he has gone further, and risked more, in the pursuit of even more harebrained schemes.\n\nBut what seems the most likely explanation is the simplest, stupidest, and most aggravating one: that Trump had no plan for the documents, except perhaps for use as souvenirs, trophies to be shown off, maybe as evidence for petty score-settling. That the documents that Trump smuggled out of the White House and squirreled away around Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster were not instruments in a coherent, well-formed plan, but instead mere ornaments to Trump\u2019s ego. In transcripts of Trump\u2019s statements about the documents that were included in the indictment, and in audio of Trump showing some of the secret papers off to a writer that was recently released by CNN, Trump uses the documents to contradict a former national security official he was then in a spat with in the press; he tells one interlocutor not to get too close to one of the secret papers, seeming to want to create a hush of reverence for the documents in place of respecting their confidentiality in the first place. At these moments, Trump does not sound as if he has a plan. He sounds as if he wants to impress the people in the room with him, and like he can think no further ahead than to how good it will feel to get their praise.\n\nWhy did Trump want the secret documents? Why did he refuse to return them? The answer may be the one truest to Trump\u2019s piddling, puerile character: because they looked cool; because they reminded him of his own importance; because the government had asked for them back, and Trump has never missed an opportunity to throw a petulant little tantrum.\n\nIt is this smallness of Trump\u2019s character, and the possible triviality of his motives, that poses a peculiar risk to both of the cases being made against Trump \u2013 the one being pursued in a Miami courthouse, and the one being pursued in public. Because there has always been an uncanny mismatch with Trump, an incongruence: between the awesome and vast powers he had in office, the historical forces he unleashed on America, and the horrible ways his presidency warped millions of lives, on the one hand; and on the other, his pettiness, his vanity, his short-sightedness, his piddling personal grievances and constant need to be flattered and reassured.\n\nThe gap between the seriousness of Trump\u2019s role in history and his unseriousness as a person is the strange place where the documents case \u2013 and, now, much of American political thought \u2013 risks getting stuck. The very silliness of Trump\u2019s use of the documents undercuts the grave risks posed by his hoarding of them.

The White House was asked about it during the press briefing today and Jean-Pierry called Kennedy\u2019s remarks not just \u201cfalse\u201d but also \u201cvile\u201d.

It just wrapped up.\n\nUpdated at 16.30 EDT\n\n17 Jul 2023 19.00 EDT Summary of the day Here\u2019s a recap of today\u2019s developments: Family members of Democratic presidential hopeful Robert Kennedy Jr joined the White House in condemning his \u201cdeplorable\u201d claim that Covid-19 was engineered to target some ethnic groups and spare others. The former attorney and nephew of John F Kennedy made the extraordinary assertion during a recent dinner in New York city, saying the virus was \u201ctargeted to attack Caucasians and Black people\u201d.\n\nDemocratic Senator Joe Manchin and Republican former Utah governor Jon Huntsman repeatedly dodged questions on whether they would run on a third-party ticket in the 2024 presidential election under the No Labels movement. The pair appeared at the group No Labels\u2019 town hall meeting to co-headline the organization\u2019s \u201ccommonsense\u201d policy platform release, the first in a series of events that the group says it will hold as the 2024 presidential election takes shape.\n\nManchin\u2019s appearance at the No Labels event on Monday has fueled speculation that he is considering a run for the presidency . If he ran for the presidency as a No Labels candidate, it could not only split the Democratic vote in a way that gives the White House to the Republicans in 2024 but also hands the party his crucial seat in what is currently a finely-balanced Senate where the Democrats have a very narrow majority.\n\nAn Iowa judge has temporarily blocked the state\u2019s new abortion ban from taking effect, just days after Governor Kim Reynolds signed the measure into law. The move restores access to abortion in Iowa for up to 20 weeks of pregnancy while the courts assess the new law\u2019s constitutionality. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut warned that it is \u201c100% certain\u201d that the Republicans will pass a national abortion ban if they win Congress next year.\n\nHouse Democrats plan to unveil a resolution to formally censure Republican congressman George Santos for lying to voters about his education, work history and family background. The resolution from Representative Ritchie Torres will be privileged, meaning that the Republican-controlled House must act on it. Santos has \u201cdisgraced [Congress], and the institution should speak with one voice against his misconduct,\u201d said Torres.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy announced a list of candidates he would nominate to the supreme court if he were elected, including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Mike Lee of Utah as possible nominees for the nation\u2019s top court.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds dodged a question about whether she would be Florida Governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s running mate if he won the Republican presidential primary. DeSantis, at a fundraising event on Saturday, told reporters that he would consider Reynolds as a pick for vice president if he won the GOP nomination.\n\nOhio secretary of state Frank LaRose formally announced his candidacy for US Senate, becoming the third prominent Republican hoping to challenge Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown in 2024. Ohio\u2019s Senate race looks to be one of the most competitive in the country next year, alongside races in Arizona, Montana and West Virginia. The state backed Trump in the 2016 and 2020 elections.\n\nA leading environmental group has hit out at US climate envoy John Kerry over comments he made rejecting calls for the US to pay climate reparations to developing countries affected by climate-change fueled disasters.\n\nJoe Biden has invited Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to Washington for an official visit, according to a statement from Netanyahu\u2019s office. The phone call between the two leaders took place as Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, is traveling to Washington for meetings with Biden and to address a joint address to Congress.\n\nThe chair of the US Congressional Progressive Caucus apologized for calling Israel a \u201cracist state\u201d. \u201cI offer my apologies to those who I have hurt with my words,\u201d Pramila Jayapal of Washington state said in a statement on Sunday.\n\n\n\n17 Jul 2023 18.44 EDT Joe Manchin refuses to rule out third-party run for president Democratic Senator Joe Manchin and Republican former Utah governor Jon Huntsman repeatedly dodged questions on whether they would run on a third-party ticket in the 2024 presidential election under the No Labels movement. Manchin and Huntsman appeared at an event hosted by the bipartisan group in New Hampshire to unveil their platform, called Common Sense. The event at Saint Anselm College in Manchester was described as the first public opportunity to highlight the group\u2019s policies. Asked if he would consider Huntsman as a potential running mate on a unity ticket, Manchin said people were \u201cputting the cart ahead of the horse\u201d and that the pair were there \u201cto make sure the American people have an option\u201d. He dismissed concerns that his candidacy could serve as a \u201cspoiler\u201d to Joe Biden that could help Donald Trump become president. I\u2019ve never been in any race I\u2019ve ever spoiled, I\u2019ve been in races to win. And if I get in a race, I\u2019m gonna win. I haven\u2019t made a decision. At a No Labels event in New Hampshire, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) says he \u201chasn\u2019t made decision\u201d on a 2024 independent run but rejects the idea he\u2019d be a spoiler.\n\n\n\n\"I\u2019ve never been in any race I\u2019ve ever spoiled, I\u2019ve been in races to win.

It\u2019s no coincidence that these \u2018banned books\u2019 are often written by or feature people of colour, Indigenous people, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. Obama\u2019s letter on Monday supported Unite Against Book Bans, a campaign led by the American Library Association (ALA). Obama also appeared in a TikTok video posted by the Kankakee Public Library, from Illinois, which has found success with viral videos. The 44th president appeared at the end of the short video, which otherwise featured staff reading books subject to bans or attempted bans. Obama was shown reading and sipping from a library-branded mug. More videos are set to be released. The ALA has found that in US public schools last year, \u201ca record 2,571 unique titles were targeted for censorship\u201d, often by parent-led groups, \u201ca 38% increase from the 1,858 unique titles targeted for censorship in 2021\u201d. \u201cOf those titles, the vast majority were written by or about members of the LGBTQ+ community and people of colour,\u201d it adds.\n\n\n\n17 Jul 2023 18.03 EDT House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Republicans will move forward with a scheduled hearing featuring Robert Kennedy Jr after the Democratic presidential hopeful was condemned for falsely claiming that Covid-19 was engineered to target some ethnic groups and spare others. \u201cI disagree with everything he said,\u201d McCarthy told reporters. But he rejected calls by Democrats to cancel Kennedy\u2019s public appearance on Thursday before a Republican-controlled House committee. The hearing we\u2019re going to have this week is about censorship. I don\u2019t think censoring somebody is the answer here. Seconds after condemning purported Democratic anti-semitism, Kevin McCarthy defends House Republicans inviting RFK Jr to testify before Congress despite his anti-semitic remarks because \"I don't think censoring somebody is actually the answer here\" pic.twitter.com/yx5DscxSy8 \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) July 17, 2023\n\n\n\n17 Jul 2023 17.52 EDT Richard Luscombe Close Kennedy family members weighing in reflects the growing outrage at Democratic presidential hopeful Robert Kennedy Jr\u2019s words, which he tried to disavow on Monday in a statement sent to the Guardian by his campaign staff. The statement reads: The New York Post story is mistaken. I have never, ever suggested that the Covid-19 virus was engineered to \u2018spare Jews,\u2019 and I unequivocally reject this disgusting and outlandish conspiracy theory. New York Post reporter Jon Levine exploited this off-the-record conversation to smear me as an antisemite. This cynical maneuver is consistent with the mainstream media playbook to discredit me as a crank - and by association, to discredit revelations of genuine corruption and collusion. Separate messages sent to the Guardian purportedly from Kennedy\u2019s personal email address cite Wikipedia links to press articles about the plausibility of ethnically-targeted bioweapons. \u201cThe study is solid, and not at all controversial,\u201d one of the messages says of a research paper by the British Medical Association, reported by the Guardian in 2004, that \u201crogue scientists\u201d could develop bioweapons designed to target certain ethnic groups based on their genetic differences.\n\n\n\n17 Jul 2023 17.40 EDT Iowa judge temporarily blocks state's abortion ban An Iowa judge has temporarily blocked the state\u2019s new abortion ban from taking effect on Monday, just days after Governor Kim Reynolds signed the measure into law. Polk County District Court Judge Joseph Seidlin ruled that a lawsuit by abortion providers is likely to succeed, and the temporary injunction will remain in place for the duration of the lawsuit. The move restores access to abortion in Iowa for up to 20 weeks of pregnancy while the courts assess the new law\u2019s constitutionality. Last week, Iowa lawmakers passed a six-week ban on abortion in a rare special legislative session, called by Governor Reynolds, who signed the bill on Friday afternoon. The law would ban almost all abortions once cardiac activity can be detected, which is usually six weeks into a pregnancy and before many women know they are pregnant. Prior to the law, abortion was legal in the state up to 22 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\n\n17 Jul 2023 17.29 EDT West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin is speaking at an event hosted by the moderate group No Labels, fueling speculation that he could run on a third-party ticket for the presidency. Manchin has not declared whether he will run, but it\u2019s difficult to see how his flirtation with No Labels would amount to a serious candidacy, according to a Vox report. It\u2019s true that many Democrats don\u2019t want Biden to run again, and many Republicans say the same of Trump, who is the current GOP frontrunner. But while 2024 may shape up to be the rematch no one asked for, third-party candidates don\u2019t have a successful track record in the US, and there\u2019s no indication a third-party candidate would be able to launch a credible challenge to either party\u2019s nominee this time. If Manchin or another third-party candidate runs, they would probably lose badly. They might, however, get enough support among moderates to derail Biden in states that he narrowly won in 2020, despite No Labels co-chair Joe Lieberman\u2019s assurances that his group is not looking to get in the race for a \u201cspoiler.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 17.30 EDT\n\n17 Jul 2023 17.13 EDT The White House\u2019s press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, described Robert F Kennedy\u2019s comments that Covid-19 was \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people as false\u201d and \u201cvile\u201d. \u201cThe claims made on that tape is false,\u201d she said during a press briefing earlier this afternoon.

But she warned that the presidential candidate\u2019s remarks amounted to encouraging racist theories around the virus. If you think about the racist and antisemitic conspiracy theories that come out of saying those type of things, it\u2019s an attack on our fellow citizens. And so it\u2019s important that we essentially speak out when we hear those claims more broadly. She also cited a statement from the American Jewish Committee that called Kennedy\u2019s claims \u201cdeeply offensive\u201d and reflective of \u201csome of the most abhorrent antisemitic conspiracy theories throughout history.\u201d Jean-Pierre added: This is something that this president, and this whole administration, is going to stand against.\n\nUpdated at 17.13 EDT\n\n17 Jul 2023 17.07 EDT Former Utah governor Jon Huntsman, who is due to speak at this evening\u2019s No Labels event in New Hampshire, has insisted it is \u201cnot a campaign\u201d.

DeSantis, at a fundraising event on Saturday, told reporters that he would consider Reynolds as a pick for vice president if he won the GOP nomination. Asked about DeSantis\u2019s comments, Reynolds told Fox\u2019s Ainsley Earhardt: I appreciate the comments. But look, I\u2019m so focused. We are implementing a boldest universal school choice plan in the country. I just called a special session last week. This last week we passed the fetal heartbeat bill, and I actually cut state government and I cut 21 agencies from my Cabinet and we\u2019re implementing our alignment bill. She added: So I\u2019m busy working on being governor of the great state of Iowa and I\u2019m already working on cutting taxes again next year. So that\u2019s my focus right now. Donald Trump last week expressed his frustration with Reynolds for declining to endorse a candidate early in the race. In a post to Truth Social, Trump wrote: I opened up the Governor position for Kim Reynolds, & when she fell behind, I ENDORSED her, did big Rallies, & she won. Now, she wants to remain \u2018NEUTRAL.\u2019 I don\u2019t invite her to events! DeSanctus down 45 points! DeSantis, speaking on Saturday, also dismissed Trump\u2019s criticism of Reynolds, saying: I thought the attacks on her were totally, totally out of hand and totally unnecessary.\n\n", "tiktoken_token_count": 3319, "llama_token_count": 4061}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Lloyd Green", "title": "No Trade Is Free review: Trump\u2019s man plots an unusually civil course", "description": "Robert Lighthizer, once US trade representative, is a rare aide of little interest to investigators.

Unlike the former president and his director of trade and manufacturing policy, Peter Navarro, Lighthizer is not now fending off prosecution. He did not pique the interest of the January 6 committee.\n\nBut Trump and Lighthizer are still members of a mutual admiration society. No Free Trade, Lighthizer\u2019s first book, comes with Trump\u2019s endorsement. It is \u201ca masterpiece that describes how my administration stood up to China and fought back against the globalists and communists that have been ripping off American workers for decades\u201d, the former president gushed on Truth Social.\n\nLighthizer, Trump added, was \u201cthe greatest United States trade representative in American history\u201d.\n\nOn the page, Lighthizer returns the favor. \u201cTrump was a great boss,\u201d he writes. In return, he recalls Trump saying: \u201cBob Lighthizer is great; I\u2019ve heard it for years.\u201d\n\nIn 2016 and 2020, Lighthizer donated an aggregate of $3,950 to Trump\u2019s campaigns. Talk about a return on investment.\n\nNo Free Trade is replete with intellectual gymnastics. Lighthizer repeatedly delivers hosannas to the \u201cliberal democratic\u201d order and criticizes Vladimir Putin \u2013 but keeps mum about January 6 and Trump\u2019s indictments. Nor does he have anything to say about the 45th president\u2019s relationship with the Russian dictator or his tropism toward despots in general.\n\nAs is to be expected, not everyone on Trump\u2019s team was enamored with Lighthizer. In his own book, Taking Back Trump\u2019s America, Navarro scolded him for refusing to appear on TV in the run-up to the 2020 election. The \u201cGreta Garbo of the West Wing\u201d, to quote Navarro, Lighthizer possessed savvy and presence \u2013 and refused to engage when the election hung in the balance.\n\nBack in the day, as a member of the Reagan administration, Lighthizer helped negotiate \u201cvoluntary restraints\u201d on imports of Japanese cars and steel. The experience provided valuable knowledge of the trade playbook. After his stint in the executive branch, Lighthizer returned to Bob Dole\u2019s orbit as treasurer to the Kansas Republican\u2019s 1996 presidential campaign. The pair had backed the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), enacted in 1994, when Bill Clinton sat in the White House.\n\nOver time, however, Lighthizer became a Nafta critic. He now writes that Ross Perot got it right when he warned of a middle-class job exodus if the agreement became law, of a \u201cgreat sucking sound\u201d, indeed. Along with the Iraq war and the opioid crisis, the downside of the free trade deal with Canada and Mexico helped drive lunch-bucket voters into Trump\u2019s arms and transform the Democrats into an upstairs-downstairs coalition.\n\nNafta \u201cis no longer an acronym \u2013 it\u2019s a noun and a profanity\u201d, Salena Zito and Brad Todd caught an interviewee saying in The Great Revolt, their 2018 book about the forces that helped empower Trump.\n\nAs a lawyer in private practice, Lighthizer represented the US steel industry. As Trump\u2019s trade representative, he negotiated the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement, aka the USMCA, to replace Nafta. He also clashed and negotiated with China.\n\nHe now castigates the Biden administration for being insufficiently tough with Beijing, but observes that Trump\u2019s tariffs against China have been maintained. Lighthizer calls Katherine Tai, his successor as US trade representative, \u201cestimable\u201d, lauding her efforts to protect American industry. He also has kind words for Nancy Pelosi and Richard Neal, Democrats now former House speaker and former chair of the tax and trade committee. Lighthizer was once chief of staff to the Senate finance committee. He maintains respect for Capitol Hill.\n\nHe testified there recently, about the danger posed by China.\n\n\u201cI believe that China is the most dangerous threat that we face as a nation,\u201d he told a House select committee. \u201cIndeed, it may be the most perilous adversary we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nWhatever the danger posed by China, Lighthizer has indirectly invested there himself. His 2019 and 2020 executive branch personnel public financial disclosures show ownership of between $2m and $10m in the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund. Tencent, the Chinese technology and entertainment conglomerate, is one of the fund\u2019s largest holdings.\n\nIrony abounds. In August 2020, Trump issued an executive order to \u201caddress the threat posed by WeChat\u201d, seeking for it to be banned. WeChat is \u201ca messaging, social media and electronic payment application\u201d owned by \u2026 Tencent.\n\nPredictably, Lighthizer trashes \u201cglobalists\u201d, the Koch-funded Cato Institute and other ideological free-traders. He takes aim at Larry Summers, a veteran of the Clinton and Obama administrations and former president of Harvard. Summers called for tariff cuts to reduce the sting of inflation. Lighthizer calls him \u201cChina\u2019s favorite former treasury secretary\u201d.\n\nLighthizer neglects to examine how free trade became a Republican orthodoxy \u2013 until it wasn\u2019t. In 1962, Milton Friedman, of the University of Chicago, wrote in Capitalism and Freedom, his best-known work, that the US should scrap tariffs.\n\n\u201cIt would be far better for us to move to free trade unilaterally, as Britain did in the 19th century when it repealed the Corn Laws,\u201d Friedman urged. \u201cWe are a great nation, and it ill behooves us to require reciprocal benefits from China, Mexico or Europe before we reduce a tariff on products from those countries.\u201d\n\nIn August 1980, Friedman repeated that call. A decade later, George HW Bush did the heavy lifting on Nafta. More Republicans than Democrats backed that agreement.\n\nIn Lighthizer\u2019s eyes, Friedman fairs better than Summers. Lighthizer takes issue with the Nobel-winner\u2019s take on floating exchange rates but ignores his legacy on trade. Likewise, he goes easy on Bush.\n\nBeyond all that, No Trade Is Free is an accessible and readable chronicle of US trade history and policy over the past half-century.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1278, "llama_token_count": 1552}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Rich Tenorio", "title": "Filthy Rich Politicians: journalist Matt K Lewis on Trump, ethics and money in Washington", "description": "New books discusses \u2018disturbing\u2019 discoveries about how politicos enrich themselves, from stocks to lobbying and book dealsWhen Covid-19 materialized as a serious threat, Richard Burr took action.

Burr also contacted his brother-in-law, who made his own stock dump. After the trades were publicized, Burr resigned as chair of the intelligence panel. But he was not charged with a crime.\n\nFor the reporter Matt K Lewis, the story is part of an ever-increasing problem: the outsized role of wealth in Washington. The Daily Beast journalist has written a book, Filthy Rich Politicians, that was published in the US this week. The extent of the problem is reflected by Lewis\u2019s subtitle: The Swamp Creatures, Latte Liberals, and Ruling Class Elites Cashing in on America.\n\n\u201cRich people get elected, and people, when elected, tend to get richer,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cOver time, it has gotten worse.\u201d\n\nThe narrative is bipartisan and includes progressives and populists from members of the Squad to election deniers.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just an irony that I wrote the book Filthy Rich Politicians in a moment when all the politicians in America \u2026 one thing almost all have in common is trying to position themselves as being populist outsiders attacking elites,\u201d Lewis says.\n\nHe is concerned by politicians bolstering their finances during moments of crisis, as Burr did during Covid.\n\n\u201cThat, I think, is one of the most interesting and disturbing parts of the book. Everybody kind of knows politicians are rich and some of what they do is sketchy. This, I think, most Americans don\u2019t fully appreciate.\u201d\n\nWhether regarding Covid or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lewis says, \u201cThese are the moments when it really pays off to have inside information.\u201d He points out that the list of members of Congress who made advantageous stock purchases ahead of the Ukraine war included Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, a Democrat, and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a notorious hard-right Republican.\n\nThe House of Representatives has become a flashpoint. In the lower chamber, where members are ostensibly closer to average Americans, incomes have climbed quite high. The average member of Congress is now 12 times wealthier than the typical US household.\n\n\u201cIn the last four decades, the gap has demonstrably widened between politicians and \u2018We, the people,\u2019\u201d Lewis says.\n\nCauses range from insider trading to book deals to lobbying, family members and friends getting in on the action through paid positions as campaign or office staffers. Lewis cites numerous examples.\n\nMatt Lewis. Photograph: Center Street\n\nThe former Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi and her husband, Paul Pelosi, have netted millions from his stock deals, outperforming top investors including Warren Buffett while Nancy Pelosi fended off attempts at reform.\n\nIn the annals of lobbying, there is Billy Tauzin, a former Republican congressman from Louisiana. On Capitol Hill, Tauzin helped then-president George W Bush pass a Medicare bill. His term done, Tauzin became a lobbyist for big pharma.\n\nRunning for office is a perfect fit for high-net-worth individuals. After all, it requires significant time off from work and enough campaign funds to draw in outside donations. It helps if you\u2019re born into wealth, marry into it \u2013 or both.\n\nLewis comes from a different background \u2013 though he notes that his wife, Erin DeLullo, is a political consultant who has worked with some of the Republicans he criticizes as self-proclaimed populists, despite their Ivy League degrees.\n\nLewis\u2019s father was a prison guard for three decades. The family never lacked for food on the table, but Lewis got a rude introduction to the wider world when he made his own foray into campaign politics. A $1,000 check was late to his bank account, giving him an impromptu lesson in how much it costs to be poor in Washington.\n\nThen, after becoming an opinion journalist at the Daily Caller, a conservative site, Lewis learned how rich people populate the DC landscape. One day, he was researching a tip that a prominent liberal family was polluting the environment with its penchant for boating. A family member contended otherwise, asking if Lewis knew anything about sailing or yachting. Lewis confessed he did not, asked his colleagues if they did, and saw a sea of hands.\n\n\u201cFor me, it really hit home that I wasn\u2019t in Kansas any more, so to speak,\u201d he recalls.\n\nLewis planned his book as a survey of America\u2019s 100 richest politicians. It evolved into a more substantive project, although the original idea is reflected by two lists in the appendix: the 25 wealthiest members of Congress and the 10 richest presidents.\n\nThe Florida Republican senator Rick Scott \u2013 who before entering politics ran a company fined $1.7bn for Medicare fraud \u2013 leads the congressional list with more than $200m. Top of the presidential list is Donald Trump, whose net worth topped out at $3.1bn.\n\n\u201cPutting money aside, [Trump] changed the game in many ways,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be the same, and not primarily because of his wealth \u2013 he\u2019s such a different type of human being and president than we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nIronically, Trump\u2019s populist denunciations of corruption and the DC \u201cswamp\u201d resonated strongly with voters.\n\nCiting a 2015 Pew Research Center survey, Lewis says: \u201cThree-quarters of Americans believed politicians were primarily selfish and interested in feathering their own nest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise that one year later, Donald Trump was elected. He talked about how the game was rigged, he talked about elites and the establishment and the need to drain the swamp.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden stands on stage with his wife Jill, sons Hunter and Beau and father Joe Biden Sr, at a campaign event in 1988.

Thursday\u2019s 6 to 3 ruling barring affirmative action at Harvard and the University of North Carolina will affect virtually every selective higher education institution in the US, with potential ramifications far beyond.\n\nOn Friday, the last day of the term, the six conservatives wielded their sword over LGBTQ+ rights. In another 6 to 3 ruling, they slashed to the ground anti-discrimination protections to allow a devout Christian web designer to turn away same-sex couples.\n\nThe case, 303 Creative v Elenis, was instigated by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a rightwing Christian group that has been classed as an extremist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Its legal arguments were based on questionable evidence.\n\nThe icing on the conservative cake, also delivered on Friday by a 6 to 3 margin, struck down the Biden administration\u2019s student debt forgiveness plan. Buried with it were the financial hopes of 40 million Americans.\n\nThe noise of the last couple of days comes at the end of a judicial term in which, in other respects, the chief justice John Roberts had made notable efforts to keep the court more attuned to rest of the nation. In rulings over voting rights and Native American protections he had steered a middle course, much to the relief of progressives who had been expecting the worst.\n\nBut it is the booming decisions on race, LGBTQ+ rights and student debt for which the 2022-23 term will most be remembered. The willingness of the six rightwing justices to stamp their mark on essential spheres of American life, shredding up to half a century of settled law in the process, confirmed the exceptional nature of the current bench.\n\nJoe Biden put it pithily: \u201cThis is not a normal court.\u201d\n\nLia Epperson, a constitutional law professor at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law, said that a clear pattern was now emerging. \u201cWe see the court willing to go places it has not gone so quickly in the past, eviscerating precedent and disrupting social norms in ways that are so far reaching.\u201d\n\nThe decision to end race-conscious admissions puts an abrupt halt to 40 years of established practice in both public and private colleges. That is an echo of the Dobbs abortion ruling, in which the conservative supermajority tore up Roe v Wade, which had stood as the law of the land for 50 years.\n\nA majority of Americans support Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan. Photograph: Shutterstock\n\nThe court\u2019s most seismic decisions not only discarded long-held precedent, they also swam against the tide of public opinion. The five men and one woman who compose the Trump-created supermajority \u2013 unelected and appointed for life \u2013 are dramatically impacting the lives of millions of Americans in what amounts to minority rule:\n\nThe right to an abortion is supported by 61% of Americans;\n\nThe court\u2019s block on Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan goes against the views of 62%;\n\nThe decision to tear down affirmative action flies in the face of 63% of Americans who want the practice to continue;\n\nSeventy-one per cent think same-sex marriages should be recognized by law and entitled to the same rights as traditional marriages.\n\n\u201cThe court system has become so independent of American public opinion and desires \u2013 and certainly our understanding of the constitution \u2013 that it risks damaging democracy in a significant way,\u201d said Caroline Fredrickson, a law professor at Georgetown University.\n\nSo fierce has been the supermajority\u2019s assault on American values and norms that it is certain further to embolden calls for a reboot. Anger towards the court is on the rise, and confidence in it at an historic low.\n\nThe recent spate of ethics scandals have only aggravated the situation. All three of the conservative hardliners \u2013 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and the Trump-appointed Neil Gorsuch \u2013 have fallen foul of ethics disputes.\n\nThe trio were exposed as having failed to disclose luxury travel, lavish gifts or financial interactions with billionaires or corporate interests. Uniquely though, they have the ability to turn a blind eye to the accusations \u2013 supreme court justices are the only judges in the country who are unbound by any ethics code.\n\nThe backlash is already gathering speed. Within hours of the affirmative action ruling, Hank Johnson, a Democratic congressman from Georgia, denounced it as the work of \u201cMaga\u201d justices, after Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again slogan.\n\nJohnson is sponsoring a bill that would expand the court from nine to 13 justices as a means of loosening the hard right\u2019s grip on power. \u201cJudicial activism must be met with passage of my legislation,\u201d he thundered.\n\nCalls to the barricades such as Johnson\u2019s threaten the reputation and stability of the supreme court. The standing of one justice is especially imperiled: Chief Justice Roberts.\n\nThe court\u2019s shift sharply to the right has led observers to question whether Roberts has ceded leadership to his most extreme peer, Clarence Thomas. \u201cRoberts has lost control of the supreme court,\u201d warned the New York Times opinion pages. \u201cThe Thomas court,\u201d proclaimed the anti-Trump conservative group, the Lincoln Project.\n\nHeadlines like these cannot please Roberts, a lawyer who cares about the public-facing aspect of his job. Roberts cut his judicial teeth in the political realm, as counsel in Ronald Reagan\u2019s justice department.\n\nAs a result of that exposure to the cut and thrust of political life, perhaps, he is sensitive to public opinion and shows a keenness to hold the people\u2019s trust. Those are sentiments that seem not to perturb his more headstrong colleagues.\n\n\u201cRoberts is more careful in suppressing his viewpoints when he recognizes that they will inflame those who want to reform the court; he plays a long game,\u201d Fredrickson said. \u201cThomas and Alito don\u2019t have that vision \u2013 they want immediate gratification, whereas the chief is satisfied with delayed gratification.\u201d\n\nThat distinction was on display in three important rulings issued earlier in June. In each, Roberts surprised observers by breaking up the monolithic 6 to 3 hard-right supermajority and forging new alliances.\n\nIn Haaland v Brackeen, Roberts forced Thomas and Alito back into the minority by orchestrating a 7 to 2 ruling that preserved the Indian Child Welfare Act. The decision was hailed by Native American groups as an existential victory upon which the survival of tribes depended.\n\nTwo major voting rights decisions, both written by Roberts himself, were also met with stupefaction. Progressive groups had been bracing themselves for further blows to democratic norms from a court that appeared hell-bent on undoing the gains of the civil rights movement.\n\nYet when they came down, Roberts\u2019s decisions were surprisingly humble, sticking closely to existing law. In Allen v Milligan, he and another Trump appointee Brett Kavanaugh joined the three liberal justices to find against Alabama in its attempt to draw congressional maps that blatantly discriminated against Black voters.\n\nThat ensured the continuation of Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Lyndon Johnson\u2019s landmark civil rights legislation that brought millions of African Americans into the democratic process. Part of the puzzle of the Milligan ruling was that it went against Roberts\u2019s own track record: over decades he had expressed an open antagonism towards Section 2 stretching all the way back to the early 1980s.\n\nIn the second voting rights case, Moore v Harper, Roberts yet again drew back from the nuclear option, forcing Thomas and Alito into the minority alongside Gorsuch. Had the hardliners prevailed, a crank reading of the constitution known as the \u201cindependent state legislature theory\u201d would have given state legislatures virtually untrammeled power over elections free from judicial oversight from state courts.\n\nFar-right Republican lawmakers would have been empowered to do their worst, ranging from extreme partisan gerrymandering all the way to a potentially supercharged assault on democracy in the 2024 presidential race that might have made the assault on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 look like a tea party.\n\nRoberts assuaged those fears, resoundingly rejecting the theory.\n\nThe headline writers duly obliged. \u201cJohn Roberts has wrested back control of the supreme court,\u201d Slate magazine pronounced on Tuesday.\n\nTwo days later came the storm.\n\nThe release of three devastating rulings, blasted out over the two final days of the term, will at least for now silence talk about Roberts\u2019s moderating influences. This is the chief justice, after all, who personally wrote two of them \u2013 affirmative action, and the block on student loan forgiveness \u2013 and who joined the third attacking LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nAnalysts point out that it was always a mistake to perceive Roberts as a moderating force or to underestimate the intensity of his conservative ambitions. A quick look back at the landmark rulings of the Roberts court settles that score:\n\nCitizens United (2010), which Roberts joined opening the floodgates for corporate cash to enter politics;\n\nShelby County (2013), which he wrote punching a giant hole in the Voting Rights Act and prompting a resurgence of voter suppression;\n\nObergefell v Hodges (2015), which guaranteed the right to gay marriage and which Roberts opposed, issuing a strongly worded dissent;\n\nAnd this week\u2019s affirmative action and LGBTQ+ rulings (2023), which respectively set back the fight for equal opportunities for minorities in education and opened the door to overt discrimination of protected groups.\n\nThat is quite the record.\n\n\u201cI remain very skeptical of chief justice Roberts\u2019s judicial temperament,\u201d Fredrickson said. \u201cHe is driven not by disagreement with his conservative peers, but by a different strategy: how to get to the same ends.\u201d\n\nAs the judicial term draws to a close, that may be the greatest take away: the Roberts court remains very much alive, just don\u2019t expect it to deliver too many more surprises.", "tiktoken_token_count": 2057, "llama_token_count": 2560}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Lois Beckett", "title": "How a 24-hour drag show predicted the past seven years in America", "description": "Just before Trump\u2019s election, Taylor Mac staged a spectacular queer history of the US that was mysteriously prophetic about the culture wars that would followIn 2016, I bought a ticket to a drag show that promised to recap the entire history of American democ\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/30/taylor-mac-24-hour-drag-show", "text": "In 2016, I bought a ticket to a drag show that promised to recap the entire history of American democracy.

I was exhausted by the 24-hour news cycle of American politics, and unsure if I could take another 24 hours of the performance art version.\n\nBut I dragged myself to a draughty warehouse theatre in Brooklyn, New York, and was there at noon when the show\u2019s star teetered on stage in heels and a giant 18th-century wig made of tinsel, and started reading from Thomas Paine\u2019s Common Sense.\n\n\u201cGovernment, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence,\u201d Taylor Mac drawled. \u201cThe palaces of kings are built upon the ruins of the bowers of paradise.\u201d\n\nFor the next 24 hours, Mac, who would later be named a MacArthur genius and Pulitzer prize finalist, would sing some of the most popular songs of each decade of US history: 246 in all, starting with Amazing Grace and a hit from the 1770s, Everybody Hates the Congress.\n\nTo enact this \u201cradical faerie realness ritual,\u201d Mac donned elaborate new costumes every decade, all designed by artist Machine Dazzle: a barbed-wire hoop skirt studded with hotdogs for the 1860s; a pop art Jackie Kennedy suit for the 60s; a Lesbian Avenger outfit of denim, shredded flannel shirts and massive vulvar wings for the 1990s. The audience \u2013 more than 600 performance arts enthusiasts \u2013 were asked to reenact the American civil war and the Oklahoma land grab and the first world war, to line up for bread during the Great Depression and rearrange their seats to mimic white flight. There was dinner and breakfast and snacks, shadow puppets, readings from Walt Whitman, a troupe of burlesque performers, even an entire marching band.\n\nTaylor Mac in judy\u2019s A 24-Decade History of Popular Music in Montclair, New Jersey, in 2018. Photograph: Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images for Montclair film festival\n\nThis was a lurid, maximalist version of American history, told from the very queer margins. Mac, who uses the gender pronoun judy, after Judy Garland, was exploring the country\u2019s 240 years of anxiety over gender and sexuality, from the fraught effeminate figure of the 18th-century dandy, lampooned and reclaimed in Yankee Doodle Dandy, to the 1926 vaudeville song decrying the rise of \u201cmasculine women and feminine men,\u201d to the grief and terror of the Aids crisis.\n\nFor all its excess, this was an intimate performance \u2013 an attempt to explore, as Mac puts it in a new HBO documentary about the show, \u201cwhat happens when history is filtered through one body,\u201d and \u201cthe idea that a queer body could become a metaphor for America\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s almost too appropriate that Mac\u2019s drag history documentary is being released during a violent Pride month, as the Human Rights Campaign announces a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d for LGBTQ+ people in the US, lawmakers have introduced hundreds of bills targeting transgender youth and adults, and multiple states have attempted to ban or restrict drag performances. The 24-Decade History of Popular Music explores the defiant fabulousness of queer Americans as well as their intense vulnerability to shame and violence, and it forces its audience to experience the exhaustion and exhilaration of queer endurance.\n\nMac sang and joked and narrated almost nonstop the entire 24 hours, with brief pauses for pee breaks or to chug smoothies, during which the orchestra played on. Each decade, one musician departed the stage, a constant reminder of the losses of the Aids epidemic, and Mac kept singing on, voice fraying to its absolute limits.\n\nA New York Times critic called the performance \u201cone of the great experiences of my life\u201d; the Guardian said it was \u201ceverything\u201d. I have spent the past seven years thinking about it \u2013 trying to understand what Mac managed to explain about American democracy that I and my fellow news journalists still cannot.\n\nBy early October 2016, when I showed up to see Mac\u2019s spectacle, plenty of people who were not performance artists had already weighed in on the state of American politics. Confronted with Trump, they had come up with buzzwords: economic anxiety, populism, the \u201calt-right\u201d. Onscreen at Fox and CNN and NBC, surrogates and outrage peddlers assuaged and contested, and behind them the fact-checkers said: \u201cTrue\u201d, \u201ctrue\u201d, \u201cmostly true\u201d, \u201cfalse\u201d, \u201cpants on fire\u201d.\n\nTaylor Mac in A 24-Decade History of Popular Music. Photograph: HBO\n\nThe vast machinery of American politics had predicted that Clinton would win. President Trump would spend the next years gloating: Democrats, the media, all his enemies had been wrong. But Mac, dancing in false eyelashes and glitter, had not been wrong.\n\nThe Democratic party had come into the 2016 election with pretty ideas: civility, tolerance: \u201cThey go low, we go high.\u201d Then the moral arc of the universe bent right past Obama towards a president who told the Proud Boys to \u201cstand back and stand by\u201d and whose supporters stormed the Capitol.\n\nMac\u2019s 24-Decade History of Popular Music was crammed with catchy tunes, but the backstories of these hits were dark. Mac\u2019s America was not marching in a slow line of dutiful liberal progress. It was struggling in a compulsive spiral of hope and trauma and repression and denial. It was glittering and terrifying; vulnerable and vicious.\n\nThis was a country powered by a violent sentimentality that stole its popular culture from the people it enslaved, imprisoned, or refused to recognise as citizens. It was an American dream founded by people who had built their stolen nation with waves of people who had been kidnapped or who had come to this promised land from homes set aflame.\n\nMac demanded that we understand all of this. And Mac also made clear, as so many politicians and pundits still do not, that understanding is not the same as forgiveness.\n\nMac grew up in Stockton, California, a town the artist recalls as full of depressing tract houses and intense homophobia. There were no gay role models, or even out adults, and the Aids crisis was fueling an intense backlash. In 1986, as Mac tells it, judy\u2019s first wet dream featured Maggie Smith riding a Pegasus and two men having sex, and Mac spent next day at school worrying, \u201cI must have given myself Aids.\u201d\n\nThen Mac and a friend finally made it to the Aids walk in San Francisco: \u201cThe very first time I met an out homosexual, it was thousands all at the same time.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Guide Free weekly newsletter Get our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every Friday Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What I experienced was a community of people that were being built as a result of being torn apart.\u201d\n\nThis was the inspiration for what would turn into the 24-Decade History of Popular Music, an attempt, Mac says, to make audiences feel what it is like to try to build community under extreme duress.\n\nIt\u2019s strange to look back now at how this marathon of American song seemed to contain within it all the major news events of the years to come: it narrated explicit white supremacist violence and xenophobia, uprisings against police violence, threats of civil war, tensions with Russia, a devastating epidemic. This was a more accurate vision of what was ahead for the US than most political analysts had provided in 2016. I\u2019ve kept asking myself: what do artists tell us that CNN can\u2019t?\n\nPart of the answer is simply that Mac\u2019s drag show took the violence of American history seriously. People lost to war and accident tend to show up in popular songs: when will Johnny come marching home? Mac and music director Matt Ray added songs to this tradition, writing a ballad for the show\u2019s final decade to honour the people killed in the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando that year. But they also investigated the American songbook, finding passing references to the Trail of Tears in folk songs and twisting apart racist minstrel tunes.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t applaud it,\u201d Mac warned the audience as judy finished one of the most gorgeous numbers of the entire show, the lilting sea shanty Coal Black Rose. The rhythm of the sailor\u2019s physical labor is in the pace of the lines, but, Mac explained, it was also a song about gang-rape \u2013 about men building community through sexual violence. Midway through the show, and 10 months before Charlottesville, the performers also staged a furious exorcism of a Confederate soldier \u2013 denying him honour, demanding that he stay dead.\n\nIt is also the case that American politics is much more bizarre, theatrical and absurd than most of the tidy news coverage produced about it. Trump himself is, of course, an incredible performance artist, a master of audience participation.\n\nPart of what made Mac\u2019s 24 hour show so accurate was simply that it contained multitudes. There were people knitting on stage as a tribute to American handicrafts. There was a production of the Mikado staged on Mars.\n\nThere was the burlesque artist Tigger!, who pantomimed an elaborate striptease while not wearing any clothes at all, the best preparation I can imagine for eight years of watching the jiggle and droop of a president\u2019s naked ego.\n\nMac and judy\u2019s collaborators had built failure into their marathon performance, arguing that greatness could only be achieved when perfection was physically impossible. Would Mac even be able to sing for the full 24 hours? Nobody knew. But Mac was also arguing for failure on a deeper level, proposing a queer American origin story rooted in grief and struggle. We did not need to wait for a better time, the show suggested. Right here, in the middle of losing everything \u2013 this is the heart of our country. This is the only place to build.\n\nAt around 7am, the sleepiest part of an all-nighter, Mac asked us to take revenge on Ted Nugent by staging a gay prom to Snakeskin Cowboys, a country song about gay bashing.\n\nFind someone of the same gender to dance with, Mac commanded us, and I wandered through the crowd. \u201cThere are so many men in this room,\u201d another woman told me, as we finally turned towards each other. I had not realised it, but it was true. Then a third woman found us, and we sighed and wound our arms around each other.\n\nWe were so impossibly tired by then, but somehow we swayed gently to the music, held each other up. I knew already, in those slow news days of 2016, that history does not stop, but if you are lucky it will ignore you for a little while, and you can hide together, rest in the smell of her shampoo.\n\nAt some point in the last of the 24 hours, I stumbled out of the dark cave of song and into the lobby. I was surprised to find it was light again, a gray, dim light, and the world was still there. Rain. The Brooklyn Bridge.

The white nationalist ideology which inspired Payton Gendron to travel 200 miles to massacre 10 people in a Black Buffalo neighborhood is becoming as American as cherry pie.\n\nNeiwert shows such extremism has been \u201cwidely adopted\u201d from \u201cthe highest reaches of the Republican party\u201d to broadcasts by Tucker Carlson, \u201cthe most popular cable talk show host\u201d until Fox News fired him.\n\nThe surge in rightwing extremism inspired by the election of the US\u2019s first Black president was reflected in an explosion in militia groups during Barack Obama\u2019s first year in office. Then came Donald Trump, the first modern president to celebrate white supremacists. He praised \u201cfine people on both sides\u201d in Charlottesville, Virginia, where in August 2017 neo-Nazis clashed with counter-protesters, and he embraced the Proud Boys in 2020, telling them to \u201cstand back and stand by\u201d.\n\nThe collaboration between such a president and the high-speed locomotive of social media has had disastrous consequences. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have brought American wackos together faster than any previous medium.\n\nNeiwert is a former senior writer for Daily Kos, the admirable progressive website founded by Markos Moulitsas 21 years ago. But Neiwert\u2019s work goes back further. When he started out, he saw rightwing extremism as \u201can excellent bet\u201d to propel a career in journalism, \u201can endless wellspring of human misery, social disruption and frightening violence \u2013 the kind of behavior that always makes news\u201d.\n\nWhen Timothy McVeigh killed 168 by blowing up a truck outside a federal building in Oklahoma City, it became clear to Neiwert that the far right was \u201can existential threat not just to innocent people in its vicinity, but to democracy itself \u2026 What was striking \u2026 was how frequently their rhetoric waded into open sedition.\u201d What Neiwert has learned over decades is one of the essentials lessons of his book: \u201cThey never ever give up \u2026 They are relentless in finding new ways to insinuate their toxic beliefs within the mainstream of American politics.\u201d\n\nNeiwert offers some of the most detailed descriptions I have read of the movement\u2019s biggest moments, including Charlottesville and the January 6 Capitol attack. His rigorous reporting produces many details new to me, including the fact that when a Swat team evacuated congressmen from a balcony on January 6, the officers drew guns on insurgents \u201coutside the balcony doors\u201d and forced them to \u201clie prone\u201d as the legislators escaped.\n\nAfter Charlottesville, as a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center, Neiwert covered events that advanced the right\u2019s strategy for \u201csimultaneously intimidating the general public while generating a phony narrative blaming leftists \u2026 for the brutality they themselves inflicted\u201d. Now, he documents how so many far-right conspiracies have made their way into the mainstream, especially the great replacement theory, which says progressives want to flood the country with immigrants, to undermine white citizens.\n\nHow successful has this effort been? In 2020, the Republican party refused to withdraw support from of any of the \u201c64 GOP candidates \u2026 with QAnon connections\u201d. In 2022, a poll found that nearly 70% of Republicans believed in the great replacement theory. Last week, the Washington Post reported the adoption of the great replacement theory as far away as Tunisia, where President Kais Saied sparked \u201cevictions, firings, arrests and brutal assaults\u201d of Black Africans, causing a surge in their efforts to escape to Europe.\n\nWhen Ron DeSantis\u2019s press secretary, Christina Pushaw, said that any opponent of the Florida governor\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t say gay bill\u201d was \u201cprobably a groomer or a least you don\u2019t denounce the grooming of 4-8 year old children\u201d, she used language \u201cdirectly inspired by the hysterical QAnon conspiracy cult \u2026 in no time at all, Pushaw\u2019s tweets made \u2018grooming\u2019 a mainstream rightwing talking point\u201d.\n\nNeiwert\u2019s book is full of reminders of how social media promote rightwing lies. When a veteran of the Tea Party movement teamed up with two ex-writers for Steve Bannon\u2019s Breitbart News to start a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d Facebook group in November 2020, it got 300,000 followers in 24 hours. Facebook took the page down but Bannon started his own page the same day, then changed its name to \u201cOwn Your Vote\u201d. The associated groups \u201camassed 2.5 million followers\u201d. YouTube, another giant purveyor of hatred and lies, hosted Stop the Steal videos which attracted 21m views and 863,151 likes.\n\n01:16 Trump namechecks Proud Boys as he refuses to condemn white supremacists in debate \u2013 video\n\nNo one has been more important to the mainstreaming of extreme rightwing views than Trump.

Though, extended litigation from Trump or prosecutors could delay proceedings further.\n\nTimings in this case are significant because of the consequences of an extended delay. If the case is not adjudicated until after the 2024 election and Trump is re-elected, he could try to pardon himself or direct the attorney general to have the justice department drop the case.\n\nThe trial date of 20 May 2024 means it will come after most of the Republican primaries and his criminal trial in New York, but only two months before the Republican national convention in July, where Trump is the frontrunner to clinch the nomination.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Cannon\u2019s trial date will hold. Notably, Cannon appears to have taken prosecutors\u2019 own estimate that they would only need roughly two weeks to decide Cipa Section 6(c), where the judge will decide what redactions for classified information are appropriate.\n\nThe justice department can propose to Cannon, for instance, that Trump should only get to present redacted versions of the classified documents so that they can protect some of the sensitive information from public disclosure.\n\nBut Cannon is not required to accept the request for redactions, in which case prosecutors could appeal her decisions to the US court of appeals for the 11th circuit \u2013 a move that would take far longer than the two weeks allotted and substantially push back the current trial date.\n\nThe scheduling order was the first major decision in the classified documents prosecution for Cannon, who is under heightened scrutiny for issuing favorable rulings to the former president during the criminal investigation, before they were overturned on appeal.\n\nIn her seven-page order, Cannon gave neither side exactly what they wanted, rejecting Trump\u2019s request to indefinitely postpone setting a trial date after finding that some case management was necessary and rejecting the government\u2019s idea for a December trial as \u201catypically accelerated\u201d.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Start the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day\u2019s must-reads from across the Guardian Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His own siblings disagree. His uncle\u2019s presidency, like his namesake father\u2019s career and presidential campaign, had an aura of hope and responsibility as well as glamour. RFK Jr talks vaguely of overcoming divisions, but in reality trades upon a peculiar blend of \u201ccynicism and credulity\u201d, as one commentator notes. Most recently he claimed that \u201cCovid-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese,\u201d in comments reported by the New York Post.\n\nHowever jarring the remarks \u2013 he partially backtracked later \u2013 they sit comfortably with his long history of fomenting conspiracy theories and his nonsensical, anti-scientific views. He has falsely linked childhood immunisations to autism and wifi to cancer and \u201cleaky brain\u201d, claimed that HIV does not cause Aids, and suggested that chemicals in drinking water could make children transgender. One of his sisters warned that his latest comments put people\u2019s lives in danger.\n\nSo much for the Kennedy legacy. Nor does he look like much of a Democrat. He is being hyped by billionaires and rightwing broadcasters such as Sean Hannity, and has gained traction among Republicans rather than Democrats. Some see his campaign primarily as a vehicle for his ego and brand, which may be less damaging to President Biden\u2019s chances than a possible third-party bid by Democratic senator Joe Manchin and Republican former governor Jon Huntsman\u2019s No Labels group. A poll this month suggested that a \u201cmoderate, independent third-party candidate\u201d could gain about 20% of the vote and result in a second term for Donald Trump. But talk up Mr Kennedy enough and he might have a marginal effect in denting President Biden. Others suspect that Mr Kennedy wants the Republican vice-presidential slot. Steve Bannon and Roger Stone have both floated the idea of a Trump-Kennedy ticket.\n\nNone of this has prevented him finding up to 20% support among Democrats in polls. Camelot nostalgia and the celebrity factor have clearly played a large part in that. Mr Kennedy has never run for any public office, still less held it, but boasts that he\u2019s \u201cbeen around\u201d politics since he was a little boy. The lack of enthusiasm for the sitting president is also potent: most Democrats do not want him to run again, although they indicate that they would vote for him over Mr Trump. Voters, including independents, are not giving Mr Biden credit for the improving the economy or other achievements. That may not be fair. But it\u2019s a fact.\n\nMr Kennedy\u2019s appeal goes deeper, however. He has found a home in the world described by a new book, Conspirituality, where new age spirituality and the \u201cwellness\u201d industry overlap with the politics of paranoia, as well as alongside the Trumpian right. Distrust of institutions, suspicion at the marriage of state and corporate power, and fear and sadness at the despoliation of the environment are in themselves reasonable concerns. But the political ambition that feeds upon and mutates them into more poisonous beliefs is unpalatable.\n\nMr Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine conspiracy-mongering has caused enough damage. His latest remarks show how easily conspiracy theories blur into bigotry and scapegoating. It may be farcical to hear a multimillionaire from the country\u2019s most famous political dynasty railing against \u201celites\u201d, but there is nothing funny about this campaign.", "tiktoken_token_count": 709, "llama_token_count": 855}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Margaret Sullivan", "title": "A strong whiff of desperation surrounds threats to impeach Biden | Margaret Sullivan", "description": "Anything to please Trump and disparage the successful Democratic presidentThe setting was inevitable, and the personalities predictable.On a Fox News interview (where else?) conducted by Sean Hannity (who else?), the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, floated the\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/26/republican-threat-impeach-biden-desperation", "text": "The setting was inevitable, and the personalities predictable.\n\nOn a Fox News interview (where else?) conducted by Sean Hannity (who else?), the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, floated the idea on Monday that House Republicans should move toward impeaching President Biden.\n\nUnhampered by the lack of evidence of presidential malfeasance, McCarthy took the leap that the Republican party\u2019s right wing has long been craving.\n\n\u201cThis is rising to the level of impeachment inquiry,\u201d he told his eager media helper, one of Donald Trump\u2019s staunchest allies.\n\nSo what are the purported reasons for an impeachment inquiry? Both involve Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s undoubtedly troubled and troubling son.\n\nThe first claim is that Joe Biden, while vice-president, participated in his son\u2019s influence peddling. That Hunter did engage in influence peddling for personal profit is a fair claim. Did he suggest that his father, the veep, was willing to go to bat for foreign companies or governments? Not proven but not hard to believe. But that is a far cry from impeachable wrongdoing by Biden himself. (Hunter Biden never worked in the White House, let\u2019s recall, unlike certain opportunistic Trump family members.)\n\nTrump\u2019s more incendiary claims that Joe Biden \u201creceived millions of dollars\u201d from foreign sources appears to be made up out of whole cloth; the House oversight committee has been investigating Biden for months with little to show for it.\n\nThe second claim is that Hunter Biden got a sweetheart deal from the current justice department, resulting in his recent guilty pleas on misdemeanor charges of tax evasion. Although two former Internal Revenue Service representatives told the House committee that they thought a justice department investigation was hamstrung because of political interference, and that Hunter Biden committed felony-level offenses, no evidence of Joe Biden\u2019s malfeasance has emerged. In fact, in an unusual move, the justice department is allowing David Weiss, the Trump-appointed US attorney who led the Hunter Biden investigation, to testify \u2013 presumably to counter the notion that the Biden administration hobbled his investigation.\n\nAs for the Republicans\u2019 excited touting of a potential witness who would somehow produce proof of the president\u2019s corruption, that went up in flames when it was revealed that the would-be witness himself was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2022 (long before his present accusations surfaced) of brokering arms deals with China and Iran. Oh, yes, and he\u2019s a fugitive from justice.\n\nIn the wake of that mess, the Maryland Democrat and committee member Jamie Raskin was blunt: \u201cThis Inspector Clouseau-style quest for something that doesn\u2019t exist has turned our committee into a theater of the absurd, an exercise in futility and embarrassment.\u201d\n\nEven the former Trump insider, the Ukrainian-born American businessman Lev Parnas, once assigned to find wrongdoing by the Bidens in Ukraine, agreed. In a letter to the chairman of the House committee, Parnas wrote that \u201cthere has never been any factual evidence, only conspiracy theories\u201d about such claims.\n\nStop the charade, he urged. \u201cThe narrative you are seeking for this investigation has been proven false many times over by a wide array of respected sources. There is simply no merit to investigating this matter any further.\u201d\n\nBut McCarthy and company have no intention of taking that advice. They are, after all, playing to the Trump-controlled base of a Republican party that has gone off the rails \u2013 with the dedicated help of the rightwing media and the incessant normalization of the mainstream press.\n\nAnd they are playing to a powerful audience of one: the twice-impeached Trump himself, frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nMeanwhile, things are \u2013 from the perspective of their boss \u2013 going a little too well for incumbent Biden.\n\nInflation is under control. Unemployment is extremely low. Real wages are up.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem like everything\u2019s breaking Biden\u2019s way lately?\u201d Nate Cohn of the New York Times asked recently, even while noting that Biden\u2019s approval numbers remain low. They have ticked up recently and they may rise more as the reality of an improved economy penetrates public opinion.\n\nSuch good news for Trump\u2019s biggest political adversary is unacceptable. Thus, the desperate measure.\n\nThe \u201cimpeach Biden\u201d movement should be seen for what it is: a maneuver to distract from Trump\u2019s own legal troubles, as investigations mount over election meddling, misuse of classified documents and his role in fomenting the January 6 insurrection.\n\nIt\u2019s also an effort to confuse those Americans who have trouble sorting fact from fiction.\n\n\u201cIf everybody always lies to you, the consequence is not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer,\u201d the great social critic, Hannah Arendt, warned in the 1950s.\n\n\u201cAnd with such a people,\u201d she added ominously, \u201cyou can then do what you please.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what is scary about McCarthy\u2019s move this week.

What do you do?\n\nFor most normal people, the answer would be to build your political career gradually. Start small, work your way up, and hope that one day your hard work gets you one of the biggest jobs in the world.\n\nBut Kari Lake, a self-described \u201celection-denying deplorable\u201d who has helped boost conspiracy theories about Covid vaccines and once called Anthony Fauci an \u201cevil elf\u201d, is not like most normal people. Her two-pronged strategy for rising to the top of the political world? 1) Say as many bigoted and outlandish things as possible, in a bid to generate headlines. 2) Become Donald Trump\u2019s loudest lapdog.\n\nFor a while, that strategy seemed to work. A few months ago, Axios reported that Trump was strongly considering picking a woman to be his running mate for the 2024 election, and Lake was one of his top choices. Lake also won a straw poll for the Republican vice-presidential pick during the Conservative Action Political Conference in March. She got 20% of the vote, beating the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley (10%) and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis (14%). Not bad for someone whose biggest political accomplishment is running for governor of Arizona in 2022, losing, then baselessly claiming that the election was rigged.\n\nWhat Lake lacks in experience she makes up for in shamelessness. It\u2019s not clear what \u2013 if anything \u2013 the 53-year-old actually believes but she\u2019s clearly willing to say whatever it takes to get ahead. In 2008, for example, Lake donated to Obama and even reportedly campaigned for him. Now, however, she\u2019s reviving the racist birther conspiracies about him. She was once friends with one of Phoenix\u2019s best-known drag queens; now she\u2019s demonizing drag shows. She\u2019s an ambitious woman but she also has no problem telling young conservatives that women \u201caren\u2019t equal to men\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t want to be equal to them because we are not the same\u201d.\n\nLake has also positioned herself as Trump\u2019s biggest cheerleader, proclaiming her devotion to the former president at every opportunity \u2013 even threatening armed resistance against anyone who went after her idol. She\u2019s also gone to great lengths to stay as close as possible to the presumed Republican nominee. Last month People reported that Lake essentially moved into Mar-a-Lago and is at Trump\u2019s resort more than Melania Trump. It\u2019s not clear whether she\u2019s having official meetings with Trump or if she\u2019s just sidling up to him every time he hits the DJ decks (something he apparently does after dinner at the club every weekend) and begging for a key role in his 2024 campaign. \u201cShe is working the deal,\u201d sources previously told People about Lake\u2019s vice-presidential ambitions. \u201cShe wants something bigger, fast, to compensate for her loss in Arizona.\u201d\n\nAlas, it seems that Lake may have flown just a little too close to the sun. Despite her sycophancy (she once told Piers Morgan that Trump is so powerful he wouldn\u2019t even need a vice-president), there are reports that Trump has soured on his protege. His newfound objections? Lake likes the limelight too much, apparently. She\u2019s a \u201cspotlight hound\u201d, one Trump adviser complained to the Daily Beast. When Trump thinks you\u2019re too thirsty for attention, that\u2019s really saying something.\n\nIf Trump really has turned on Lake, is this the end of her career? Unfortunately, I doubt it. Her hopes of being Trump\u2019s running mate may have hit a snag, but she\u2019s still got her eyes on a Senate seat. \u201cShe\u2019s a shameless, ruthless demagogue who wants power and will do whatever she has to do to get it,\u201d a Trump adviser complained to the Daily Beast. Which is exactly the sort of person who tends to do well in modern politics.\n\nMarjorie Taylor-Greene called Lauren Boebert a \u2018little bitch\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s heartwarming to see two of the worst politicians in America publicly feuding.

He also criticized the right-leaning bench by equating them with Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rightwing voting base, by characterizing the ruling as having come from the \u201cMaga Republican-controlled supreme court\u201d.\n\nSchumer also called out the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of the court, ruling Biden\u2019s loan forgiveness plan unconstitutional while its leading conservatives, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, are embroiled in ethics scandals over accepting luxury gifts from conservative billionaires without declaring them.\n\n\u201cThe hypocrisy is clear: as justices accept lavish, six-figure gifts, they don\u2019t dare to help Americans saddled with student loan debt, instead siding with the powerful, big-monied interests,\u201d added Schumer.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who has long championed student loan forgiveness, said that the court \u201crefuses to follow the plain language of the law on student loan cancellation\u201d.\n\nBut she warned on Twitter: \u201cThis fight is not over. The president has more tools to cancel student debt \u2013 and he must use them.\u201d\n\nNew York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez emphasized that Biden still has the power to pursue student loan forgiveness.\n\n\u201cIt is very important to note this Scotus [supreme court of the United States] ruling does NOT remove Biden\u2019s ability to pursue student loan forgiveness,\u201d said Ocasio-Cortez via Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe Biden Admin can use the HEA (Higher Ed Act) \u2013 our position from the start \u2013 to continue loan forgiveness before payments resume. They should do so ASAP,\u201d she added.\n\nThe American Federation of Teachers (AFT) called the ruling a \u201cfull-frontal attack on young people\u2019s futures\u201d.\n\n\u201cBetween yesterday\u2019s affirmative action case and today\u2019s decision on student debt, the court has decided that if you or your family has the ability and means, you can succeed, but if you\u2019re a struggler or striver, you\u2019re on your own,\u201d said the AFT president, Randi Weingarten.\n\nThe voting rights organizer and former Democratic candidate for Georgia governor, Stacey Abrams, criticized the court for its latest decision as well as the Friday ruling in favor of a Colorado web designer who refuses to provide services for same-sex marriages because of her Christian beliefs, a ruling which critics say also opens the door to businesses discriminating on the basis of race, gender identity, faith or disability.\n\n\u201cThis week, [Scotus] struck down the ability to ameliorate the currency of racism, legalized discrimination against the LGBTQ community, and blocked access to debt relief for millions. Real people. Real lives. Real consequences,\u201d said Abrams in a tweet, while urging people to continue to vote.\n\nConservative lawmakers, meanwhile, celebrated Friday\u2019s ruling, marking another victory for Republicans in the Senate who confirmed the three right-leaning justices nominated under Donald Trump.\n\nThe Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, called the loan forgiveness plan \u201csocialism\u201d and a \u201craw deal deal for hardworking taxpayers\u201d.\n\nMcConnell said: \u201cThe president of the United States cannot hijack 20-year-old emergency powers to pad the pockets of his high-earning base and make suckers out of working families who choose not to take on student debt.

I worked.\u201d\n\nSusan: \u201cWe\u2019ve all worked. (Pointedly) Londoners work.\u201d\n\nGiven the startling state of blue-on-blue bickering it\u2019s broadcasting\u2019s loss that the LBC husting was among the last before London party members decide which candidate will challenge the current mayor, Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan. An earlier favourite, Daniel Korski, dropped out after breast-groping allegations, which he denied.\n\nSo, Susan or Moz? The Boris-, Brexit- and Truss-supporting veteran running unironically as \u201cSafer with Susan\u201d, or the unknown outsider his supporters are currently depicting as \u201cmysterious\u201d, as opposed to opportunistic and clueless? Last week, urged to be realistic about his housebuilding fantasies, Moz complained: \u201cPeople are obsessed with figures.\u201d\n\nIt might be simplest for the still undecided to toss a coin. What might seem matchless voter-repelling capacity in one merely takes a different form in the other. Both oppose Ulez expansion. As for differences in local knowhow, neither London expert, it emerged, was entirely sure about the population. Was it, Susan, the professional Londoner, hazarded, in answer to Dale, \u201cbetween nine and 10 million\u201d? Moz: \u201cSame, closer to nine.\u201d The last census made it 8,799, 800.\n\nWhat might seem matchless voter-repelling capacity in one merely takes a different form in the other\n\nKhan, now understandably unable to conceal a certain complacency about his claim on, at least, a third term (there is no statutory limit), has said he\u2019d prefer to run against Hall, formerly leader of the Conservatives in the London Assembly. But having watched the candidates, I suspect he\u2019d do as well, maybe better against Hossain, a successful but oddly evasive barrister whose bid, with little else to recommend it, returns relentlessly to \u201cmy backstory\u201d. On the Four Yorkshiremen scale, it admittedly amounts to a comprehensive challenge to Khan\u2019s luxurious \u201cson of a bus driver\u201d narrative. Until 16, in Bangladesh, Hossain had no shoes. NB: Khan had shoes. And now look: a London KC with plenty of shoes (if selected, perhaps he will put a figure on it). Classic Dick Whittington once you\u2019ve replaced the black cat with property developer and Moz backer Nick Candy, and the Bow bells with campaign staff who \u2013 like Candy \u2013 attended the infamous \u201cmingle and jingle\u201d lockdown party. Hossain, with an air of long experience in absolution, counsels mercy: \u201cThey are very remorseful.\u201d\n\nIt was said of David Frost that he rose without trace. Hossain has not so much risen as materialised, for no discernible purpose other than to make Londoners speculate, once again, on what it is about the mayor\u2019s job that repeatedly attracts wildly unprepossessing or inadequate candidates. The restricted powers with the consolation of limitless self-promotion?\n\nIn the first contest, Jeffrey Archer was welcome until an ex-friend exposed his perjury. He was replaced by Steven \u201cShagger\u201d Norris. High among Khan\u2019s appreciated attributes have been that, along with being hated by Donald Trump, he was a blessing after Johnson and a hero compared with Zac Goldsmith. But who, generally speaking, isn\u2019t?\n\nFully acknowledging Khan\u2019s achievements in air quality and social housing, it remains possible to imagine someone new doing more with the third mayoral term he\u2019s due to inherit, with tireless help from the Tories, from himself. All the more so, for non-violent Londoners, after Khan failed to condemn misogynistic incitement by a lead speaker who urged a cheering crowd in Westminster: \u201cIf you see a Terf, punch them in the fucking face.\u201d Though Khan may yet explain, before the 2024 election, how that exhortation can be reconciled with his admirable \u201c\u2018whole society\u2019 approach to tackling violence against women and girls\u201d. He recognises, to quote the #Have a Word campaign, that such violence \u201coften starts with words\u201d.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s out of respect for party tradition dating from Archer (who had lied about paying Monica Coghlan for sex), thereafter featuring Norris v the \u201cmonstrous regiment\u201d and years during which Boris Johnson balanced mayoral duties with his commitments to Jennifer Arcuri (a regrettable disappearance of his emails precludes important learnings from this arrangement) that the Conservatives alighted, in Hall, on a woman whose oracy will never upset their menfolk.\n\nIn the event of her selection, of course, this could be less of an electoral plus. Cheerfully, Hall admits she once tweeted that a celebrity was a \u201cstupid, fat blonde woman\u201d: \u201cYes, I am inclined to say what I think.\u201d \u201cI nagged like only a female can,\u201d she remarks of another achievement.\n\nThose supporting her know that Trump\u2019s advice on pussy-grabbing never diminished Hall\u2019s regard. \u201cCome on Donald Trump \u2013 make sure you win and wipe the smile of (sic) this man\u2019s face,\u201d she tweeted in 2020 (the \u201cman\u201d being Khan). As for Trump\u2019s Capitol mob: Susan thought remainers who \u201ccampaigned to overturn democracy and the will of the British people\u201d were in no position to judge.\n\nAny London party members for whom Trumpian loyalty resembles an asset may want to weigh this against Hossain\u2019s arguably closer connections: his supporter Nick Candy was a happy, post-Capitol visitor to Mar-a-Lago, alongside Nigel Farage.\n\nAssuming their party is not, on some unconscious level, in love with Khan, or (at risk of a Springtime for Hitler-style miracle) overdoing a scheme to prevent the creation of a successor-Johnson, what explains Tory satisfaction with such a shortlist? Despair? Fatalism? Reasonable enough, but still careless reputationally, given the many months in which Susan/Moz hilariously presents themself, with a bigger election looming, as what London deserves: the Conservative party\u2019s best shot at talent.\n\nCatherine Bennett is an Observer columnist", "tiktoken_token_count": 1374, "llama_token_count": 1653}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Helen Sullivan and agencies", "title": "Explainer: What is the Joint Security Area between North and South Korea?", "description": "A US soldier who has been detained in North Korea reportedly entered the country during a tour of the JSA<ul><li>US soldier detained by North Korea after crossing border during visit to DMZ </li></ul>A US soldier was detained by North Korea on Tuesday after h\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/19/what-is-the-joint-security-area-north-korea-south-korea", "text": "A US soldier was detained by North Korea on Tuesday after he crossed into the country \u201cwilfully and without authorisation\u201d, according to a US official.\n\nThe soldier, Private 2nd Class Travis King, crossed the military demarcation line that separates the two countries while on a tour of the Joint Security Area (JSA) between North and South Korea. He is the first American detained in North Korea in five years.\n\nWhat is the Joint Security Area?\n\nAlso known as Panmunjom or the \u201cpeace\u201d or \u201ctruce\u201d village, the JSA is a section on the 250km-long Demilitarized Zone separating North and South Korea.\n\nIn 1948, when the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) were created, the DMZ marked the border between the two countries. In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, starting the Korean war, which ended in an armistice in 1953, signed at the JSA, at which point the DMZ became a 2km-wide buffer zone. The DMZ is lined on both sides with razor wire, heavy armaments and tank traps.\n\nA North Korean soldier stands guard on the North Korean side of the Joint Security Area in the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ). Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images\n\nThe peace village is made up of bright United Nations-blue buildings, bisected by a military demarcation line. The two Koreas have their own liaison offices and conference halls in the JSA and troops from each country face each other across the military demarcation line, but despite working in close quarters, communication is often strained.\n\nDuring periods of high tensions phone hotlines often go unanswered, forcing US or South Korean officials to try to shout across the border.\n\nFor years, both sides also blared propaganda broadcasts over the DMZ into each other\u2019s territory. The broadcasts ended after a 2018 military agreement.\n\nThe JSA is overseen by North Korea and the UN Command, a multinational military force established during the Korean war.\n\nIn 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean president Moon Jae-in met on the north and south sides of Panmunjom. In 2019, US president Donald Trump became the first incumbent president to enter North Korea, when he travelled to the JSA, crossed the military demarcation line on foot and shook hands with Kim.\n\nKim Jong-un meets Donald Trump in the Joint Security Area Photograph: KCNA/KNS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCan you visit the JSA?\n\nUnder a 1953 deal, the UN Command and the North Korean military were allowed to send no more than 35 troops to the JSA, and each of them can only possess one pistol or non-automatic rifle. But the number of soldiers and weapons increased as relations worsened. No civilians live in the JSA.\n\nVast stretches of the DMZ have been no man\u2019s land for more than 60 years, where wildlife has flourished undisturbed. Other parts of it offer an unsettling mix of military installations and tourist attractions.\n\nMultiple companies offer tourists visiting South Korea the chance to visit the JSA. Lonely Planet describes it as \u201cunquestionably the highlight of any trip to the DMZ\u201d during which, \u201cYou\u2019ll be taken inside the meeting room \u2013 where the 1953 truce was signed \u2013 the only place where you can safely walk into North Korea\u201d.\n\nNorth Korean soldiers (C) take photos of a South Korean soldier (L) and a US soldier (R) standing before the military demarcation line separating North and South Korea. Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt was while on one of these tours that US soldier Travis King crossed the border. The Donga and Chosun Ilbo newspapers cited South Korean army sources who claimed the man was with a group of visitors, including civilians, to the Panmunjom truce village \u201cwhen he suddenly bolted over the brick line marking the border\u201d.\n\nThe DMZ is littered with landmines planted over the decades, as many as 970,000 in the southern part alone, according to Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor, a Geneva-based civic group.\n\nWhy did the US soldier cross the military demarcation line?\n\nThat remains unclear. King had served nearly two months in a South Korean prison for assault. He was released and was meant to travel home to Fort Bliss, Texas, where he faced further disciplinary action. After being escorted to the airport, he left and joined a tour to the JSA.\n\nThe US is working with North Korea to \u201cresolve this incident\u201d, said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

The unemployment rate dipped to 3.6%\n\nLast Thursday we learned that the US economy grew at an annualized 2% rate in the first quarter of this year. That\u2019s well above economists\u2019 expectations of around 1.4%.\n\nBut if you haven\u2019t received this news, you\u2019re not alone. Good economic news doesn\u2019t make it through the negative sludge of Fox News or Newsmax. It barely gets through the mainstream media.\n\nYou want some additional good news? In the four years of Donald Trump\u2019s administration, total investment on manufacturing facilities grew by 5%. During the first two years of Biden\u2019s administration, manufacturing investment more than doubled.\n\nThis has created about 800,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\nThese remarkable results are the outcome of Biden policies \u2013 the Inflation Reduction Act and its green technology provisions, the infrastructure bill and the Chips Act.\n\nWhat about inflation? Yes, Biden\u2019s stimulative spending did boost prices. But the big news that\u2019s not getting through to most Americans is that inflation has been dropping. It has declined significantly from its mid-2022 highs above 9%.\n\nConsumer prices are now rising by about 4.9% annually \u2013 still a problem but not nearly the problem it was.\n\nMuch of the remaining inflation is due to outsized corporate profit margins. The IMF recently found that almost half the increase in Europe\u2019s inflation over the past two years is due to rising corporate profits.\n\nI wish Biden would make an issue of those profit margins. They\u2019re enriching those at the top while imposing a big penalty on everyone else.\n\nAnd wages? For a while, real (adjusted for inflation) wages were falling, but now that inflation is subsiding, real wages are picking up again.\n\nSo why do so many Americans continue to think the economy is awful?\n\nAccording to the Gallup economic confidence index, Americans haven\u2019t felt this bad about the economy since the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. The University of Michigan\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index is similarly downbeat.\n\nIn an NBC News survey conducted a few weeks ago, at least 74% of Americans said the country is on the wrong track.\n\nGiven all this, it\u2019s not surprising that Joe Biden\u2019s approval numbers have been stuck at around 43%.\n\nHistory shows that incumbent presidents tend not to be re-elected when about 70% of Americans think the country is on the wrong track. (They tend to win when fewer than half of Americans think that.)\n\nSo, the obvious question is, why are Americans feeling so bad about an economy that\u2019s actually damned good?\n\nOne reason, I think, is a general sense of dread \u2013 centering on Trump, DeSantis and Republican lawmakers in general \u2013 that seems to affect everything else. (I don\u2019t know about you, but I sometimes have difficulty getting to sleep, worried about the rise of authoritarian fascism in America.)\n\nAdd in the effects of the climate crisis, and you get more gloom. (This week, the earth\u2019s average temperature reached the highest on record.) A recent study found that headlines have grown starkly more negative.\n\nThen, too, many of us are still suffering from pandemic-related PTSD.\n\nBut I think the deeper reason Americans don\u2019t feel very good about the economy is that is that the vast number of working non-college grads \u2013 some two-thirds of the adult US population \u2013 are still bogged down in dead-end jobs lacking any economic security, while struggling with many costs (such as housing, childcare and education) that continue to soar.\n\nIn other words, the economy is getting better overall \u2013 but overall has become a less useful gauge of wellbeing as the rich get richer, the poor grow poorer, and the working middle is under worsening siege.", "tiktoken_token_count": 803, "llama_token_count": 990}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Dan Milmo Global technology editor", "title": "Meta oversight board orders firm to take down video by Cambodian leader", "description": "Board overturns decision to leave up Facebook video of Hun Sen threatening opponents with violenceMeta\u2019s content moderation board has ordered the social media company to take down a video of the Cambodian prime minister threatening his political opponents wit\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/29/meta-oversight-board-orders-firm-to-take-down-video-by-cambodian-leader-hun-sen", "text": "Meta\u2019s content moderation board has ordered the social media company to take down a video of the Cambodian prime minister threatening his political opponents with violence, and urged it to suspend his Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nThe oversight board, whose decisions on content are binding, overturned Meta\u2019s decision to leave up a video on Facebook in which Hun Sen issued a number of threats. It also called for an immediate six-month suspension of Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook page, which has 14 million followers, and his Instagram account, which has 167,000 followers.\n\nHun Sen, who has led Cambodia for nearly four decades, announced before the ruling on Thursday that he would stop using Facebook and move to the Telegram messaging service instead, although he would still use Instagram.\n\nOn 9 January 2023, Hun Sen\u2019s official Facebook page livestreamed a speech by the PM responding to allegations that his ruling Cambodia People\u2019s party had stolen votes during local elections last year.

In response, Meta said in deciding whether content should be kept up under \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d criteria it balanced public interest and the risk of harm.\n\nThe board said Meta\u2019s decision to keep up the video was wrong and that Meta had \u201crewarded\u201d Hun Sen\u2019s behaviour, which has included a \u201csustained\u201d campaign of harassment and intimidation against independent media and the political opposition. Because the board\u2019s content decisions are binding, Meta will now have to remove the video.\n\n\u201cThe board finds that Meta was wrong to apply a newsworthiness allowance in this case, as the harm caused by allowing the content on the platform outweighs the post\u2019s public interest value,\u201d the board wrote.\n\nCalling for changes to the newsworthiness policy, which is not a binding recommendation, the board added: \u201cThe board urges Meta to clarify that its policy on restricting the accounts of public figures is not limited solely to single incidents of violence and civil unrest, but also applies to contexts in which citizens are under continuing threat of retaliatory violence from their governments.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Besides voting all the way down ballots during local, state and national elections, they can organize against the political forces which planted the seeds for this week\u2019s volley of supreme court rulings, the vice-president said while appearing at the Essence Festival of Culture in New Orleans on Thursday and Friday, according to Nola.com.\n\nThe supreme court\u2019s shift to the hard right became possible after the Donald Trump presidency succeeded in appointing the ultra-conservative justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nHarris predicted the week\u2019s supreme court decisions would \u201chave generational impact\u201d and described herself \u201cdeeply concerned about the implications of this \u2026 to the future of our country\u201d, Nola.com added.\n\nIn her remarks at the Essence Festival, one of the US\u2019s top annual showcases for Black culture, Harris said: \u201cI feel very strongly that the promise of America will only be achieved if we\u2019re willing to fight for it.\u201d", "tiktoken_token_count": 617, "llama_token_count": 780}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Editorial", "title": "The Guardian view on supplying cluster bombs: not just a 'difficult' decision, but the wrong one | Editorial", "description": "The US is to transfer the devastating weapons to Ukraine.

It is half a century since the US stopped bombing Laos, having dropped more than 2m tons of cluster munitions; decades on, people then unborn are still paying the price. On one estimate, it will take another 100 years to fully clear the country.\n\nThis is the true cost of cluster munitions. They are not only indiscriminate in showering dozens or hundreds of bomblets over a large area, but also have a lethal legacy because so many fail to explode, only to later be trodden on or picked up \u2013 often by curious children. For these reasons, more than 120 countries have signed the convention prohibiting their use, production, transfer and stockpiling.\n\nThe US, Russia and Ukraine, however, have never been signatories. Russia has used them extensively in Ukraine, including in populated areas where no military personnel or infrastructure were evident. Kyiv has also employed them, more sparingly, but reportedly at the cost of civilian lives in Izium (though it denies they were used there). Now the US will supply more as part of a $800m (\u00a3625m) military aid package, at Kyiv\u2019s request. Thankfully, the UK, which has signed the convention, has ruled out following suit. Joe Biden has said he made a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d. No doubt. But the president has made the wrong one.\n\nUkraine\u2019s counteroffensive has failed to gain the traction it needs, and supplies of artillery shells are running low. The argument is that, however significant the risks and long-term costs of using cluster bombs, civilians will pay a far higher price where Russian forces prevail. Cluster munitions are effective in combating dug-in ground troops, like the Russian forces along the vast frontline. But the same, of course, could be said for chemical weapons, and the US rightly finished destroying its remaining stockpile of those on Friday. Efficacy is why bans on such arms are needed in the first place. Russia\u2019s use of them is not a reason to further drag down international norms.\n\nUkraine\u2019s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, says it has given written guarantees that it will not use the US-supplied weapons in Russia, nor in urban areas where civilians might be killed or wounded. It will also record their use, to expedite demining when the conflict is over. The US claims its munitions are far safer than those used by Moscow, with dud rates \u201cnot higher than 2.5%\u201d versus Russian devices that reportedly fail 30-40% of the time. Experts say test results don\u2019t reflect real world conditions and that, in any case, the sheer number of submunitions still means a deadly aftermath.\n\nInvasion has forced Ukraine to make tough decisions about how to defend itself. The US was nonetheless wrong to meet its request. The decisions of the world\u2019s most powerful country and military are key to determining global norms. Before Donald Trump took office, it had made some recent steps towards controlling cluster munitions. But it should never have deployed them, including in Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 2000s. It should not have rejected the convention banning them. And it should not be supplying them to Ukraine. Their use will have terrible long-term consequences for civilians there \u2013 and perhaps, through the example it sets, for civilians elsewhere too.", "tiktoken_token_count": 706, "llama_token_count": 817}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Victoria Bouloubasis", "title": "The housing community that will require \u2018patriots\u2019 to fly the US flag", "description": "Developer of North Carolina neighborhood for homeowners 55 and older says his brand \u2018only the beginning\u2019 of a \u2018movement\u2019The 17 June groundbreaking of a future suburban neighborhood in Gastonia, North Carolina, had all the trappings of a campaign rally.

Brock Fankhauser, the real estate developer of 1776 Gastonia, waved to onlookers from the open top of a sport-utility vehicle; his wife, Nicole, was by his side, wearing a cowboy hat and matching T-shirt with the development\u2019s namesake year, referring to the American Revolution.\n\nVideo footage of the event shows a crane dangling a giant US flag over the site where 43 lots are for sale. Parcels range from $17,500 to $75,000 for land, and homes cost $410,000 and up in this city 20 miles from Charlotte. A young girl rode a horse down a newly paved street flanked by American flags. She gripped the saddle with one hand; in the other, a giant flag. Her sandy blonde hair flowed in rhythm with the Stars and Stripes.\n\nThere will be even more flags. This development, which the company has described as \u201cwhere freedom lives\u201d, is for homeowners 55 and older. And not just any homeowners: \u201cpatriots\u201d who will be required to fly the US flag on their properties, on a pole provided and maintained by the subdivision. Each 1776 community (Fankhauser plans on more) will also donate a home with no mortgage, free of cost, to a wounded veteran through the nonprofit Building Homes for Heroes.\n\nWith ambiguous ideals and an insistence on a disinterest in politics, the 1776 brand builds off the contentious history of the US flag. Historically, the flag has been a symbol of protest, pride and polarization. When Donald Trump kissed and caressed the American flag after a 2020 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), he mouthed the words: \u201cI love you, baby.\u201d The gesture landed favorably with his conservative base.\n\nWhen asked how this community will define patriotism, Fankhauser responded obliquely that patriotism is a mountain landscape. \u201cWe\u2019re in a valley right now, and to the extent that I can have any impact whatsoever on bringing us from a valley towards a peak, it would give me tremendous satisfaction,\u201d he said via phone.\n\nAs for how he plans to identify potential homeowner-patriots for the 1776 community, Fankhauser said: \u201cThere is no screening process that\u2019s different than how one would buy a home in any other neighborhood. We\u2019re only as strong as the pledges that individual homeowners make to one another.\u201d\n\nFankhauser began his career at his father\u2019s real estate company. He now specializes in low-maintenance housing for seniors, a fast-growing segment of real estate. According to Plante Moran Living Forward, an accounting firm specializing in advising senior living, projections show that age-related units will increase at a 4.7% annual growth rate, doubling senior housing demand from 2020 to 2040.\n\nSome of that boom has expanded to include \u201cactive adult communities\u201d or others with on-site health care. 1776 Gastonia is part of an even newer type of neighborhood: one where community members presumably share ideals or interests. There are even themed subdivisions like Latitude Margaritaville in Florida and South Carolina for Jimmy Buffet fans.\n\nA young girl rode a horse down a newly paved street during the 17 June groundbreaking of a future suburban neighborhood in Gastonia. Photograph: Brent Cline/1776 Gastonia\n\nFankhauser says the 1776 brand is a \u201cmovement\u201d and the Gastonia project is \u201conly the beginning\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe think that commonality and unification is a critical element in patriotism because it brings us to the broadest denominator of being in America,\u201d Fankhauser told the Guardian. \u201cWe will shun any attempts to make this a political movement.\u201d (Fankhauser donated to the Republican party and Donald Trump in 2020 and had previously donated to Republicans in 2003, according to Federal Election Commission records).\n\nStill, he\u2019s got the practiced manner of a politician whose conversations swell with lofty, vague talk about American values. It\u2019s the kind of nationalist rhetoric common to movers and shakers across the political spectrum. It\u2019s also the kind of discourse that can be weaponized \u2013 metaphorically and literally: The real estate company\u2019s staff show off star-spangled handguns on Instagram, a gift from fans.\n\nIn the launch event\u2019s recap video on the company\u2019s YouTube channel, men in kilts play bagpipes, and bikers slowly cruise a parade route. Fankhauser delivered a speech that becomes a voiceover to the tune of the national anthem. His remarks end with this signoff: \u201cGod bless this community, and God bless this great nation.\u201d\n\nFankhauser\u2019s nonspecific brand leans into what American studies professor Ben Railton refers to as mythic patriotism, which \u201ccreates and celebrates a mythologized, white supremacist vision of American history and identity\u201d. Railton, author of Of Thee I Sing: The Contested History of American Patriotism, argues that such thinking led to the January 6 insurrection and the Trump-initiated 1776 Commission that targeted professors and other educators.\n\nRailton said this ideology \u201cvery often has meant agreeing with that white-centered vision\u201d. And \u201ca lot of the time, that also defines someone who doesn\u2019t agree with that vision, who is entirely outside of it and not a part of it. When I was looking at the [1776 Gastonia] website, it\u2019s this undercurrent of, if one doesn\u2019t share this perspective, then there\u2019s not a place for you here.\u201d\n\nReal estate lawyer Harmony Taylor, who is based in nearby Charlotte, agreed that \u201cthis appears to be a pretty overt political agenda\u201d. Taylor first learned about the community through an op-ed in the Charlotte Observer.\n\n\u201cIn the United States in 2023, unfortunately, the flying of a flag or the mandating of an exhibition of patriotism in some way seems to have become aligned with a particular [far-right] political movement. And I don\u2019t think that can be ignored,\u201d she said.\n\nBut is requiring the flag even legal?\n\n1776 Gastonia will use a restrictive covenant that includes the flag stipulation. Restrictive covenants, a norm in residential real estate, allow homeowners associations to enforce rules and consistency in planned communities. Fankhauser defines them as a \u201cpledge of allegiance\u201d to the United States and \u201cpromises\u201d among neighbors. He doesn\u2019t anticipate that enforcing the flag provision will be an issue and has not included repercussions in the covenant if anyone refuses to fly the flag. The Guardian obtained the 1776 Gastonia covenant via email, but it had not yet been recorded in a Gaston County, North Carolina public database at the time of publication and is therefore not enforceable.\n\nHarmony Taylor, the Charlotte real estate lawyer, wrote about the rules governing flags and political signs in HOAs for a legal blog in 2020.\n\n\u201cTypically, restrictive covenants are designed to protect the rights, not impose a speech,\u201d she said. The Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005 did just that, legislating that condos, co-ops, residential associations or housing management groups could not ban any of their members from flying the US flag within their properties. Under North Carolina state law, the right to fly a United States or state flag in a planned community or condominium is similarly protected, with some exceptions.\n\nTaylor believes the 1776 Gastonia rule is the first of its kind in the state, and she\u2019s curious about its implications for freedom of speech. She added that constitutional free speech protections generally don\u2019t apply to private actions that curtail speech, such as covenants. But she\u2019s still uncomfortable with the idea of the development\u2019s flag mandate.\n\n\u201cI believe there is a strong public policy against requiring someone to espouse a particular political view, and I can\u2019t help but think that is different from telling someone to simply keep silent,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cIn my opinion, there is a real risk that the covenant requiring someone to fly a particular flag would be contrary to the public policy of the state of North Carolina and invalid.\u201d\n\n1776 Gastonia properties go on sale on 10 July, according to spokesperson Casey Kupper. One home site has already been allocated to veterans Peter and Kelly Clark, through the Building Homes for Heroes nonprofit. Peter is a lung and brain cancer survivor with memory issues, and his wife, Kelly, is his caregiver. Speaking from their RV in South Carolina, Kelly said they fit in well in RV parks where seniors often live, but were looking for a forever home. They don\u2019t consider themselves heroes, applying that term to Fankhauser and the nonprofit instead.\n\n\u201cWithout their generosity, we would be worried about the financial part of it because we can\u2019t afford a house right now. This is really life-changing. There\u2019s really no words to describe it,\u201d Kelly said. The neighborhood\u2019s patriotism focus was \u201can amazing bonus\u201d.\n\nFor his part, Fankhauser is gearing up for outreach, with the goal of spreading \u201ca patriotic flame that lives inside\u201d of him.\n\n\u201cI do think that I can have some influence on turning up that flame in every individual,\u201d he said.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1894, "llama_token_count": 2274}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Joan E Greve", "title": "Hunter Biden: what just happened with his plea deal?", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s son unexpectedly pleaded not guilty to tax and gun charges after judge raised questions over plea agreementHunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden, arrived in a Delaware courtroom on Wednesday morning expecting to finalize a plea agreement with f\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/26/why-hunter-biden-plea-deal-fell-apart", "text": "Hunter Biden, son of President Joe Biden, arrived in a Delaware courtroom on Wednesday morning expecting to finalize a plea agreement with federal prosecutors over two misdemeanor tax charges.\n\nHours later, Hunter Biden unexpectedly pleaded not guilty to the charges after the judge overseeing the case expressed skepticism about the specifics of the proposed deal.\n\nThe court adjourned on Wednesday afternoon without a clear path forward, and prosecutors plan to continue to hammer out the details of a potential deal in the coming weeks. Here\u2019s where the case stands so far:\n\nWhat has Hunter Biden been charged with?\n\nThe office of the US attorney of Delaware, David Weiss, has been investigating Hunter Biden since 2018 over potential violations of tax and gun laws. Weiss, who was appointed by Donald Trump, announced last month that his office had reached an agreement with Hunter Biden in which the president\u2019s son would plead guilty to two federal misdemeanor tax violations while entering a pre-trial diversion program on a separate felony gun charge.\n\nWould the deal have allowed Hunter Biden to avoid jail?\n\nYes, prosecutors were expected to recommend two years of probation for Hunter Biden\u2019s tax violations. The pre-trial diversion program would have ultimately resulted in the gun charge being dropped, assuming Hunter Biden met certain terms laid out by prosecutors. The felony charge is otherwise punishable by up to 10 years in prison.\n\nRepublicans had attacked the plea agreement as a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d that reflected a double standard of justice, but legal experts note the charges brought against the president\u2019s son are rarely prosecuted.\n\nWhat questions did the judge raise on Wednesday?\n\nThe US district judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee, expressed concern about her role in enforcing the terms of the plea agreement struck between prosecutors and Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me like you are saying \u2018just rubber stamp the agreement, Your Honor,\u2019\u201d Noreika said. \u201cThis seems to me to be form over substance.\u201d\n\nProsecutors and Hunter Biden\u2019s attorneys also clashed over whether the agreement would protect the president\u2019s son from additional charges in the future. At one point, Weiss said the investigation into Hunter Biden was ongoing, but he would not share details on the inquiry.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nNoreika gave prosecutors and Hunter Biden\u2019s defense team 30 days to further hash out the details of the agreement, and the court is expected to reconvene in the coming weeks to re-examine the case. It remains possible that Noreika will accept the plea deal at a future hearing, but she made clear she would not do so without more clarification about the details of the agreement.\n\nHas the White House weighed in on the news?\n\nThe White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said on Wednesday afternoon that she had not yet spoken to the president about the latest news on his son\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cHunter Biden is a private citizen, and this was a personal matter for him,\u201d Jean-Pierre said. \u201cAs we have said, the president [and] the first lady, they love their son, and they support him as he continues to rebuild his life. This case was handled independently, as all of you know, by the justice department under the leadership of a prosecutor appointed by the former president.\u201d\n\nJean-Pierre referred additional questions about the case to the Department of Justice and Hunter Biden\u2019s defense team.\n\nHow did Republicans react to the development?\n\nRepublicans celebrated the unexpected complication in Hunter Biden\u2019s case, and they called on Noreika to throw out the plea deal entirely.\n\n\u201cToday District Judge Noreika did the right thing by refusing to rubber-stamp Hunter Biden\u2019s sweetheart plea deal,\u201d said Congressman James Comer, the Republican chair of the House oversight committee. \u201cBut let\u2019s be clear: Hunter\u2019s sweetheart plea deal belongs in the trash.\u201d\n\nComer pledged that the oversight committee would continue examining Hunter Biden and his business dealings, which have become a central focus of Republicans\u2019 investigative work since they regained control of the House in January.", "tiktoken_token_count": 791, "llama_token_count": 991}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Ben Quinn Political correspondent", "title": "Joe Biden to meet Rishi Sunak at No 10 before Nato summit", "description": "Meeting partially overshadowed by US president\u2019s decision to send to Ukraine cluster munitions banned in BritainJoe Biden will meet King Charles for the first time since the coronation in a fleeting visit that will be used by Rishi Sunak and the US president \u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/09/joe-biden-rishi-sunak-meeting-before-nato-summit", "text": "Joe Biden will meet King Charles for the first time since the coronation, in a fleeting UK visit that will be used by Rishi Sunak and the US president as a \u201cpre-meeting\u201d ahead of joint efforts at this week\u2019s Nato summit.\n\nHowever, what will be the sixth meeting between Biden and Sunak since Sunak took office in October has been partly overshadowed by the US president\u2019s decision to send cluster munitions to Ukraine, weapons that are prohibited by 100 countries including the UK, which currently holds the presidency of a convention banning them.\n\nSunak \u2013 who said in careful comments on Saturday that Britain \u201cdiscouraged\u201d the use of cluster munitions \u2013 has a choice about how much to make of the difference when Biden visits Downing Street on Monday morning, but it is likely to be limited as the prime minister seeks to continue the process of repairing UK-US ties frayed over the course of the Donald Trump presidency and the Boris Johnson and Liz Truss premierships.\n\nBiden said on Sunday that providing the weapons had been a very difficult decision for him and, without naming the UK, added he had discussed it with allies. They were being provided because Ukraine was running out of ammunition at time when its forces were engaged in their offensive and needed to get through Russian trenches, he told CNN.\n\nBut Tobias Ellwood, a Tory MP and chair of the defence select committee, warned it could cost the \u201chigh moral ground\u201d for Ukraine\u2019s backers.\n\n\u201cAnd that could easily see this international coalition of support for Ukraine start to crumble away, because many people will be deeply concerned that we\u2019re using munitions which have been outlawed,\u201d he told GB News.\n\nBiden will later meet the king in what will be seen as a move to dispel allegations on the right that the president had snubbed Britain by not attending the coronation.\n\nBoth men will speak to top financiers and philanthropists being brought together at Windsor Castle for what the government is billing as a climate finance mobilisation forum.\n\nThe aim is to boost efforts to unlock private capital and encourage efforts that increase support for developing economies to make a net-zero transition.\n\nHowever brief \u2013 Airforce 1 is scheduled to have wheels up in time to arrive in Vilnius on Monday evening \u2013 the visit has pluses for Biden and Sunak, and comes at a particularly welcome time for the latter, as observers such as Sir Kim Darroch, British ambassador to the US from 2016 to 2019, have noted.\n\n\u201cThere is still a fascination on the part of the American public with the royals, so that image will be useful to Biden, but also the one area where the UK continues to have credibility with Washington is on defence and security, so he will be looking to ensure Sunak will be a supporter and enabler of him at the Nato summit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor Sunak, who has had a nightmare few weeks and faces some difficult political tests in the form of several byelections, it will an opportunity for him to be seen as a world leader ahead of a summit where some quite big decisions are coming up, including on the issue of Ukraine\u2019s application to join.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, polling shared with the Guardian by the British Foreign Policy Group, a UK thinktank, reflected the extent to which the turmoil of Brexit and the Trump presidency may have had an impact on British public attitudes to the US.\n\nLess than half (48%) of more than 2,000 people surveyed with JL Partners at the end of May and start of June trusted the US to act responsibly in the world. There was also a cleavage \u2013 overlayed by a generational divide \u2013 around the importance attached to the UK\u2019s relationship with US and EU, with 48% regarding the UK-EU relationship as more important and 35% prioritising the UK-US one.\n\nAt the same time, David Landsman, a former British diplomat and a senior adviser to the BFPG, emphasised how an \u201cunderlying bedrock\u201d around UK and US collaboration on intelligence and security continued to come to underpin ties.\n\n\u201cThis is a relationship which does not look in bad shape, and with both being in lockstep going into Vilnius, it does look quite powerful, particularly when it comes to bolstering a message of staying the course in Ukraine,\u201d he added.\n\nEllwood welcomed the \u201crobust and confident\u201d relationship Sunak had developed after Biden placed the UK \u201con the naughty step\u201d over the the Northern Ireland protocol.\n\n\u201cHe also saw a populism that resonated with what he was experiencing back in the US, and that aggressive, bombastic politics really wasn\u2019t his cup of tea.\u201d", "tiktoken_token_count": 944, "llama_token_count": 1097}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Michael Sainato", "title": "DeSantis reduces staff as campaign struggles to meet fundraising goals \u2013 report", "description": "Fewer than 10 staffers were laid off, Politico reports, as more shake-ups within campaign are expected in coming weeksFlorida Governor and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis has reduced campaign staff as his campaign has struggled to meet fun\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/16/desantis-reduces-campaign-staff", "text": "Florida governor and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis has reduced campaign staff as his campaign has struggled to meet fundraising goals.\n\nFewer than 10 staffers were laid off, according to an anonymous staffer, reported Politico.

The governor reactivated the state guard in 2022 after it had been dormant since the end of the second world war.\n\nIn May, DeSantis signed a bill to expand the state guard and make it permanent, expanding the group from 400 to 1,500 members and expanding its budget from $10m to $107.6m.", "tiktoken_token_count": 650, "llama_token_count": 806}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Arwa Mahdawi", "title": "Want to quickly spot idiots?

Pritzker, a billionaire and self-described \u201ccheugy dad\u201d, clearly knows a thing or two about successful commencement speeches: his talk has gone viral. While the 20-minute speech, which was organized around quotes from characters in The Office series, wasn\u2019t entirely about idiot-spotting, that section of it seemed to resonate the most.\n\nYou can see why. We live in a golden age of grifters, bullshitters and scammers. We live in an age where some of the world\u2019s most powerful people threw millions of dollars at Elizabeth Holmes, without doing proper due diligence, because she came from the right background and sounded like she knew what she was talking about. A fantasist like George Santos managed to successfully fib his way into government. And Marjorie Taylor Greene has a seat in US Congress despite routinely going on unhinged rants about, inter alia, the \u201cgazpacho police\u201d. Clearly not enough people have functioning idiot detection systems.\n\nSo how do you spot an idiot? Well, says Pritzker, it\u2019s not always easy. \u201cI wish there was a foolproof way to spot idiots, but counterintuitively, some idiots are very smart. They can dazzle you with words and misdirection. They can get promoted above you at work,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cThey can even get elected president.\u201d\n\nThat said, there are some major signs to watch out for. The best way to spot an idiot is to \u201clook for the person who is cruel\u201d, Pritzker says. \u201cWhen someone\u2019s path through this world is marked with acts of cruelty, they have failed the first test of an advanced society. They never forced their animal brain to evolve past its first instinct \u2026 Over my many years in politics and business, I have found one thing to be universally true \u2013 the kindest person in the room is often the smartest.\u201d\n\nThat is very good advice. But it\u2019s a shame, I think, that Pritzker didn\u2019t elaborate further. I think we could all do with a bit more of a comprehensive guide, don\u2019t you? So I\u2019ve helpfully put together the beginnings of one. Behold, five golden rules for spotting an idiot.\n\n1. Beware of anyone who describes themselves as a \u201cproud non-reader of books\u201d\n\nIf someone boasts about being too smart for books, it\u2019s a tell-tale sign they\u2019re an idiot. Exhibit one: Kanye West, who now goes by Ye. \u201cI am not a fan of books,\u201d the rapper told an interviewer in 2009 as he did the press tour for his own book. (Well, calling it a book is a stretch: it was a 52-page collection of his thoughts called Thank You and You\u2019re Welcome. Some of the pages were intentionally left blank and others just had a single \u201cKanye-ism\u201d on it like: \u201cI hate the word hate!\u201d or \u201cGet used to being used.\u201d) The problem with books, Ye went on, is that they\u2019re generally too wordy. \u201cI am a proud non-reader of books,\u201d he added. Which goes a long way to explaining Ye\u2019s recent descent into an antisemitic and white-nationalist rabbit hole.\n\n2. Similarly, avoid anyone who thinks that every book should have been a six-paragraph blog post\n\nSadly, Ye is far from alone in having a proud disdain for books. Over the past decade, the world has worshipped at the altar of Stem. We\u2019ve fetishized data and technology and devalued the humanities. The result is a generation of policymakers and tech bros who think that books are useless and everything can be understood through a purely technical lens.\n\nTake Sam Bankman-Fried, for example. Last year, back when the disgraced FTX founder was still being feted as a genius, SBF told the journalist Adam Fisher that he thought books were a massive waste of time. \u201cI would never read a book,\u201d SBF proclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical of books. I don\u2019t want to say no book is ever worth reading, but I actually do believe something pretty close to that. I think, if you wrote a book, you fucked up, and it should have been a six-paragraph blog post.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried, who is being investigated for allegedly misappropriating billions of dollars in customer funds, certainly knows a lot about fucking up.\n\n3. Remember that wealth isn\u2019t directly linked to intelligence\n\nAfter Bankman-Fried told Fisher that books are for losers, the journalist had an on-page existential crisis about it. Why would someone ostensibly so smart say something clearly so stupid? After agonizing about it for a while, Fisher decided that \u201csince SBF is obviously a genius, I should simply assume that, compared with me, SBF will always be playing at level N+1\u201d. Just because Bankman-Fried was massively rich and successful, Fisher decided that everything he said must have some sort of elevated logic behind it, even if it sounded demented.\n\nPeople assumed the same about Trump for a while: remember all the comments about how the former president must be playing \u201c4D chess?\u201d A lot of people had a hard time believing that someone so powerful could be so \u2026 idiotic. Instead, they convinced themselves he must be some sort of strategic genius. Turns out, no, he wasn\u2019t.\n\n4. Dropping \u201cAI\u201d or \u201cChatGPT\u201d into every second sentence is a major idiot red flag\n\nThe same people who wouldn\u2019t shut up about the metaverse a few months ago \u2013 despite being unable to succinctly define the metaverse \u2013 now won\u2019t shut up about AI. Have you heard? AI is going to be a total gamechanger that\u2019s going to disrupt everything and create a new normal. Honestly, if you took buzzwords away from these people they would have nothing left to say.\n\n5. Keep a wide berth from people who obsess about their IQs\n\n\u201cPeople who boast about their IQ are losers,\u201d Stephen Hawking once told the New York Times. See, for example, Donald Trump. The only thing Trump seems to love more than making creepy comments about his daughter Ivanka is boasting about how high his IQ is. He\u2019s referenced his IQ at least 22 times but the most memorable instance might be when he tweeted: \u201cSorry losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest \u2013 and you all know it! Please don\u2019t feel so stupid or insecure, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\nAn IQ score is a flawed measurement of intelligence \u2013 but boasting about one is a failsafe way to show people you\u2019re a dimwit.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1390, "llama_token_count": 1611}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Dana Liebelson", "title": "How Texas Republicans are catering to election deniers in this county", "description": "Heider Garcia, Tarrant county\u2019s elections administrator, quit after an election crimes taskforce was set up, which critics say undermines confidenceOn 22 November 2020, Heider Garcia, the elections administrator for Tarrant county, Texas, was awake in his liv\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/18/texas-tarrant-county-elections-taskforce", "text": "On 22 November 2020, Heider Garcia, the elections administrator for Tarrant county, Texas, was awake in his living room until around 3am, unable to sleep over fears that a stranger might show up at his house, he recalled.\n\nAn account had posted his family\u2019s home address on Twitter during weeks of false conspiracy theories and death threats about his role in the 2020 election. Donald Trump\u2019s supporters refused to believe that Tarrant county, a major, diverse county that encompasses the cities of Fort Worth and Arlington, had broken its Republican voting patterns for Joe Biden.\n\nGarcia spent Thanksgiving break installing security cameras \u2013 but he didn\u2019t quit his job or stay quiet in the wake of the threats. Rather, as he detailed in his 2022 Senate testimony, his office devoted the next 18 months to championing transparency, from releasing public records to speaking with skeptics.\n\nGarcia \u201chas an open door, he would answer the phone, and he would walk people through the process\u201d, said Paul Gronke, a political science professor at Reed College and the director of the elections and voting information center. \u201cA lot of election officials are not willing to be as open and transparent as that.\u201d\n\nBut after weathering attacks from the outside, Garcia was driven to quit in April by events closer to home. His resignation letter alluded to differences with a Republican county judge who has catered to election deniers. The judge helped set up a taskforce focused on investigating and prosecuting election crimes, which critics view as doing little but feeding the anxious climate around elections.\n\nAcross the US, conservative officials who entertain Trump\u2019s falsehoods about the 2020 election have raised alarms about voter fraud, despite a dearth of evidence that it\u2019s a problem. Some election skeptics have sought positions that influence how local elections are run, persisting even as their attempts to win and interfere with elections have mostly failed.\n\nTarrant county exemplifies the fallout of this movement in one of the most populous counties in the country. Democrats have asked the US justice department to intervene to protect voters of color in Tarrant county from intimidation. The county judge has dismissed their concerns as \u201cpartisan\u201d and \u201cpathetic\u201d.\n\nAfter Garcia resigned, the hiring process to replace him included a candidate who, as an election \u201cintegrity\u201d activist, went to a voter\u2019s home to deliver a letter questioning their choice of polling place.\n\nThere is absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing anywhere. Yet it seems that there\u2019s still a quest to find a villain Heider Garcia\n\nGarcia declined to comment on his resignation. But he said that politicians who focus on election integrity like to play the hero, and it will continue as long as they are rewarded for it. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cYet it seems that there\u2019s still a quest to find a villain.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the taskforce, which handles complaints through the sheriff\u2019s criminal investigations division and is part of the public integrity unit in the DA\u2019s office, reports no filed cases. But Texas Democrats see it as part of a bigger problem.\n\nState representative Chris Turner, a Democrat in Tarrant county, called it \u201cone more element in a years-long Republican strategy at the national, state and local level to undermine the confidence in our elections, to provide a pretext for disputing the results of elections when they don\u2019t go your way\u201d.\n\nA new taskforce\n\nTarrant county has over 2 million people, about half of whom are Black, Latino or Hispanic, according to the 2022 census estimate. Republicans have maintained their long hold on the county, even as voters slimly rejected Trump in 2020. Democrats paint last year\u2019s election of county judge Tim O\u2019Hare, a former Tarrant county Republican party chair, as an ideological shift to the right.\n\nO\u2019Hare campaigned on finding voter fraud, though an audit of the 2020 election by Republican state leadership determined that the county\u2019s election was \u201cquality\u201d and \u201ctransparent\u201d. He has fanned doubts about voting methods and echoed allegations that his opponent, the county\u2019s former Democratic party chair, led \u201ca sophisticated vote-harvesting operation\u201d. She called the allegations \u201clibelous\u201d, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\n\nO\u2019Hare did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn February, after the election, O\u2019Hare, the county sheriff, Bill Waybourn, and the district attorney, Phil Sorrells, also elected Republicans, announced the taskforce focused on election fraud.\n\nThe county already had a way to submit election complaints through the secretary of state\u2019s office, but Republicans said the taskforce would give people a central place to file complaints and bolster confidence in elections.\n\nThe taskforce began printing a non-emergency number for the sheriff\u2019s office on voting receipts, as recently as the June runoff election.\n\nThe Tarrant county commissioner, Alisa Simmons, a Democrat, said she fielded a few calls about the phone number. \u201cPeople were confused by it and uncomfortable with it,\u201d she said.\n\nThey wanted to look like they were doing something about elections integrity Kat Cano\n\nThe taskforce is \u201ca publicity stunt\u201d, said Kat Cano, who previously served as the alternate judge of the ballot board and central counting station, and the Democratic member of the public testing board, which together conduct elections oversight.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to look like they were doing something about elections integrity,\u201d she said.\n\nJulie McCarty, CEO of the True Texas Project, which boosted false claims about the 2020 election and has ties to O\u2019Hare, questioned why Democrats were so concerned about the unit. \u201cI can only assume it\u2019s because it thwarts their plans to cheat,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nAs of the 6 May election, the sheriff\u2019s office had received seven complaints in the days before the election, ranging from rude poll workers to a candidate being too close to a polling station entrance; all were closed with no criminal activity found, a spokesperson wrote in an email. The DA\u2019s office has two incidents under investigation and no cases filed, according to their spokesperson.\n\n\u201cThe taskforce is working as designed,\u201d Sorrells wrote in an email. \u201cLegal and fair elections encourage more people to vote because they know their vote counts.\u201d\n\nIn other states, Republicans have announced election integrity units in a climate where Trump has sought to undermine elections for his own benefit, despite the lack of evidence that voter fraud is a serious issue. Many have little to show for their efforts, or, as is the case in Florida, are prosecuting people with felony convictions who mistakenly thought they could vote.\n\nCriminalizing and investigating voting has long been used as a tool of intimidation, voting rights experts say, especially of voters of color. Crystal Mason, a Black woman, was sentenced in Tarrant county to five years in prison for mistakenly casting a provisional ballot in 2016 when she was on federal supervised release.\n\nThe taskforce\u2019s orbit is also broader than voters. Democrats say the 2021 election restrictions in Texas already made it more difficult to recruit election workers, who are nervous about making a mistake, and the taskforce heightens that concern.\n\nIn May, someone posted an anonymous YouTube video of Cano from 2022, doing what she called \u201cnormal work\u201d with the ballot board, but insinuating that she was manipulating ballots. (In the video, a sheriff\u2019s deputy appears to almost always be in the room.)\n\nWith the atmosphere around the taskforce, she said, \u201cany kind of accusation then becomes a sort of exercise in paranoia\u201d.\n\nShe didn\u2019t know if she was actually reported. But the fear, along with concerns about public perception, contributed to her decision to resign at the time, she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know whether they were going to try to make an example of me the way they made an example out of Crystal Mason.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Start the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day\u2019s must-reads from across the Guardian Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They opposed a bill to eliminate countywide polling locations, which has been a focus for election fraud activists.\n\n\u201cJudge O\u2019Hare, my formula to \u2018administer a quality transparent election\u2019 stands on respect and zero politics; compromising on those values is not an option for me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou made it clear in our last meeting that your formula is different, thus, my decision to leave.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Hare, in response, said that supporting the creation of the taskforce was \u201call about quality, transparent elections\u201d.\n\nGarcia, who had held his position since 2018, had over a decade of experience working for Smartmatic, a voting technology company in the private sector, a position that put him in direct opposition to election denialism.\n\nJohn Scott, who served as the interim Republican Texas attorney general, told Votebeat that Garcia was the \u201cprototype\u201d for an election administrator.\n\n\u201cWe defended Garcia on a regular basis to [those] who came to us so upset,\u201d said McCarty.\n\nElections administrators are the \u201cstewards of democracy\u201d, who work on everything from making sure citizens have access to the ballot to serving as the first point of contact for voter registration, said Gronke.\n\n\u201cIt is very disturbing when Garcia, who has shown such openness to talking with everyone, felt that his position was simply just not tenable any more,\u201d he added.\n\nA poll of local election officials published by the Brennan Center for Justice in April found that 30% had been \u201cabused, harassed or threatened\u201d because of their roles. And it\u2019s not just voters they are concerned about: more than half were somewhat or very worried about political leaders interfering with how they do their jobs in the future. As recently as June, an elections director in Arizona resigned, citing attacks from Republican officials.\n\nIn Tarrant county, Democratic officials highlighted both Garcia\u2019s resignation and the taskforce in their May letter requesting an investigation from the justice department. \u201cO\u2019Hare has consistently challenged Mr Garcia\u2019s efforts to uphold the integrity and racial fairness of our elections,\u201d they wrote.\n\nO\u2019Hare responded to their letter in a statement that did not mention Garcia. \u201cLet me be clear: this \u2018letter\u2019 is a political document. It alleges no actual wrongdoing or facts,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u2018Strange times\u2019\n\nO\u2019Hare was part of the commission picking Garcia\u2019s replacement. One candidate who advanced was Karen Wiseman, a Republican poll watcher who hand-delivered a letter to a lawful voter questioning their address during the fall 2022 election according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and challenged a contract renewal for instrumental elections software that was needed for the June runoff.\n\nGarcia told Votebeat in a text message that he wasn\u2019t surprised to see a partisan candidate in the mix. There is \u201can expectation that the [elections administrator] will play politics\u201d, he said. (Wiseman did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nThe vast majority of elections officials treat their jobs as non-partisan, according to elections experts. Some people, however, view \u201cthese positions not [as] umpires, but as players\u201d, said Lawrence Norden, senior director of the Brennan Center\u2019s elections and government program.\n\n\u201cThey have some role to play, not in just following the rules, but in helping to determine the outcome.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still a \u201ctiny minority\u201d, he emphasized. But some of the problems he has seen range from giving improper access to election equipment to refusing to certify elections.\n\nUltimately, in Tarrant county, another candidate, Clinton Ludwig, who was chosen for the job, definitively said \u201cno\u201d when asked if he had any reason to doubt the results of the 2020 election, according to Allison Campolo, the departing Tarrant county Democratic party chair who was on the hiring commission.\n\nO\u2019Hare picked people who were \u201cto me, very highly partisan\u201d, she said, though she ultimately felt the hiring process was fair.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s a partisan individual,\u201d she said of Ludwig.\n\nSimmons, the Democratic commissioner, expressed concern that Ludwig has no experience in elections administration. \u201cEverybody should be concerned about that,\u201d she said.\n\nLudwig declined to comment in an email, noting he hadn\u2019t started his job yet. But in a statement, he pointed to his 20 years of experience in the Marine Corps. \u201cYou can trust that I will further Tarrant county\u2019s legacy of conducting free and fair elections,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCampolo and O\u2019Hare both praised Ludwig.\n\nBut the taskforce \u2013 and the environment around it \u2013 only adds to \u201chow difficult it is to do an election administrator\u2019s job\u201d, Campolo said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in strange times,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nSam Levine contributed reporting", "tiktoken_token_count": 2705, "llama_token_count": 3245}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Rafael Behr", "title": "The Other Pandemic by James Ball review: QAnon as post-truth pathogen", "description": "An insightful book about the conspiracy movement compares it persuasively to a self-replicating diseaseMost people made aware of a plot to kidnap and murder children on an industrial scale would want to do something about it.

It is hardly surprising that Edgar Maddison Welch, learning of such a wicked scheme, and outraged that law enforcement agencies were doing nothing, took matters into his own hands.\n\nOn 4 December 2016, Welch brought an assault rifle and handgun down to Comet Ping Pong, a pizzeria in Washington DC, to liberate the children held captive there in the basement. But he found no children and no basement.\n\nThat setback didn\u2019t put a stop to \u201cPizzagate\u201d, a deranged fantasy among online sleuths who had identified Comet Ping Pong as the hub for a satanic paedophile ring based around Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential election campaign. As with so many conspiracy theories, the absence of supporting evidence could be folded back into the original narrative as proof of a cover-up.\n\nThat self-replicating mechanism is deftly unpacked by James Ball in The Other Pandemic: How QAnon Contaminated the World. It is a disturbing study of the origins and resilience of an exceptionally versatile and pernicious network of paranoid digital malcontents.\n\nPizzagate is just one subplot in the sprawling edifice of QAnon belief. Adherents are lured into the faith down any number of channels \u2013 Donald Trump fandom; vaccine hesitancy; self-pitying adolescent video-gamer virginity recast as militant misogyny. Followers are then radicalised by cultish solidarity, the thrill of belonging to a crusading gang, and by social media algorithms that reinforce prejudice and exclude dissent.\n\nIn some respects, QAnon is a rehash of old conspiracy theories, drawing on established tropes from the analogue age: a vast secret world government; antisemitic \u201cblood libels\u201d about ritual child murder that date back centuries. But the 21st-century version is also indigenous to the internet, emerging from a roiling soup of nerdy chatrooms, then evolving to thrive across a range of digital ecosystems.\n\nBall, a former Guardian journalist, was once an habitu\u00e9 of 4chan, the platform where the anonymous \u201cQ\u201d first posted tantalising clues about an unfolding plot at the apex of power. That experience equips him well for the task of sequencing the movement\u2019s cultural and social DNA.\n\nAs with so many conspiracy theories, the absence of supporting evidence could be folded back into the original narrative as proof of a cover-up\n\nHe is especially insightful on the influence of online role-playing games and the cultivated ambiguity around what is meant to be taken seriously and what comes draped in irony. The original trolling ethos was steeped in nihilistic mischief, breaking taboos for the sake of it, transgressing for thrills.\n\nThat slippery joking-not-joking idiom made it hard for mainstream politics to get a purchase on QAnon before it found its real-life incarnation in Donald Trump. The full scale of the cult, and the threat it posed to a democratic society, only registered for many people when its digital fingerprints turned up all over the capitol insurrection that tried to thwart Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration as Trump\u2019s successor.\n\nThe insurgents\u2019 failure provoked premature forecasts of QAnon\u2019s demise. Instead, the virus mutated and spread. For Ball, that is not a biological metaphor. He argues from Darwinian principles, via Richard Dawkins\u2019s original coinage of the word \u201cmeme\u201d for a self-replicating unit of cultural evolution, that QAnon is best understood as a literal pathogen. It is a pandemic ravaging democratic discourse in the same way that Covid-19 assaulted respiratory tracts.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Should the world\u2019s major religions, all of which have inspired crazed acts of violence throughout history, also be treated as social diseases?\n\nBall can hardly be blamed for swerving that digression when the task of charting one multi-faceted digital cult is complex enough. No less tricky is the question of a remedy. The most common treatments are factchecking and ridicule, which succeed only in driving devotees deeper into social segregation. Old fashioned refutation with evidence can\u2019t achieve much without wider reform of the digital infrastructure that creates nesting grounds for the malignant info-disease.\n\nBesides, mistrust in politics has been debilitating democratic immune systems since before social media incubated this new strain of conspiracy theory.

The Covid-19 pandemic led to the first drop in numbers since 2003-04.\n\nA similar pattern has been seen in reverse. The number of US students choosing to study abroad in China rose massively in the early 2000s, before peaking in 2012. Since then, student exchanges have fallen \u2013 with the pandemic leading to a massive drop from 11,639 US students in China in 2018-19 to just 382 in 2020-21.\n\nJournalism\n\nDuring the past few years journalistic relations between the US and China have reached new lows, with tit-for-tat expulsions and visa changes making life hard for foreign correspondents of both nations.\n\nThe Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of China said 56% of foreign bureaux noted delays in receiving J-1 visas for their correspondents in 2022, and that Chinese authorities often used Covid-19 as a pretext to deny foreign journalists access. About 38% of the journalists surveyed had Chinese sources that had been in some way harassed or called in for questioning, up from 25% in 2021.\n\nMeanwhile the number of US journalist visas issued to Chinese citizens, including family members, reached record lows in 2021, when just two were issued (non-essential visa services were disrupted by the pandemic). In 2015, a record 1,041 were issued, but numbers have been steadily dwindling since then, as relations between both countries have worsened.\n\nIn 2020 the US state department required Chinese media to register as foreign missions and also announced it was cutting the number of journalists allowed to work at US offices of leading Chinese media from 160 to 100. In November 2021, both countries agreed to ease restrictions on journalists, but just 16 were issued in the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nFilm and literature\n\nThe cooling of US-China relations has even encompassed literature. Figures from the University of Rochester\u2019s translation database shows the annual number of publications of Chinese fiction and poetry translated and published in the US has steadily declined since 2017.\n\nA Guardian analysis of books tagged \u201cUS\u201d on the website Douban \u2013 a Chinese equivalent to IMDb and Goodreads \u2013 shows a similar pattern in reverse. There were 267 US books on the site published in 2017 \u2013 which fell to 146 in 2022.\n\nThe influence of Hollywood has also faded in China. While Chinese-produced films have never been that popular in the US, Hollywood historically made up a large portion of Chinese box office revenues.\n\nIn recent years, that calculation has changed, with domestically produced films making up 85% of the Chinese market in 2022 \u2013 up from less than 50% a decade earlier.\n\nTravel and tourism\n\nThe advent of the Covid-19 pandemic caused global travel to collapse \u2013 and China has had strong restrictions in place longer than any other country. Figures from the I-94 arrivals programme, however, show a dwindling number of Chinese tourists to the US even before the pandemic hit.\n\nFigures for the first five months of 2023 \u2013 after China reopened its borders \u2013 show that arrivals are creeping up, but remain far lower than pre-pandemic levels. Just 87,600 Chinese nationals arrived in May this year \u2013 compared with 255,000 in May 2019.\n\nThe UN World Tourism Organization publishes separate figures on the number of US tourists to China, which show rising figures up until 2018, when numbers started to drop.", "tiktoken_token_count": 924, "llama_token_count": 1154}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Hugh Muir", "title": "Pity Nigel Farage as he is deemed too horrible to bank with the elite at Coutts.

Today, in the wake of the passing of the government\u2019s obscene illegal migration bill, the attention is back where it should be \u2013 on those who are truly suffering. Yes, poor Nigel Farage and his fight with Coutts, the top, top, people\u2019s bank, has made the front pages of the Mail and the Telegraph. True, their record in fighting the corner of the downtrodden is not great; but today marked a great stride forward.\n\nIt is truly a wretched story. As Oscar Wilde might have observed, you\u2019d need a heart of stone not to laugh. Farage has for many years had a bank account at Coutts. In this time, despite him not having quite as much money as top, top people are supposed to have, it has humoured him by letting him keep the account; but now Coutts has said that he can\u2019t any longer \u2013 and that has really upset Farage.\n\nSources told the BBC and others he had fallen below the financial threshold required, and was offered a standard compensatory account at NatWest, which owns Coutts. Farage maintained that his Coutts account had been shut for political reasons, and revealed that nine other lenders wouldn\u2019t take his money either.\n\nAnd because Farage is Farage, he wouldn\u2019t let it rest. Yesterday, after a subject access request to Coutts, he said, via the Telegraph, that Coutts closed his account because his views \u201cdo not align\u201d with their values.\n\nHe cites minutes of a meeting of Coutts\u2019 wealth reputational risk committee last November, which said it \u201cdid not think continuing to bank NF [Nigel Farage] was compatible with Coutts, given his publicly stated views that were at odds with our position as an inclusive organisation \u2026 This was not a political decision, but one centred around inclusivity and purpose.\u201d\n\nFarage says the notes claim that he is perceived as \u201cracist and xenophobic\u201d: an \u201cappalling slur\u201d.\n\nAnd there it is. True injustice in plain sight. No wonder Rishi Sunak has tweeted his support. Andrew Griffith, economic secretary to the Treasury, has got involved by writing a letter to the Financial Conduct Authority about the treatment of \u201cpolitically exposed\u201d bank customers such as Farage. For what point is there to a government that doesn\u2019t protect the weakest in society?\n\nIt\u2019s wrong to laugh at the plight of someone who so loves to rub shoulders with the super rich, be it Arron Banks or Donald Trump, being dumped by a bank for top, top people because they think he\u2019s just a bit, well, grubby.\n\nIt\u2019s wrong to laugh at seeing this champion of capitalism, a former City trader whose father was a stockbroker and brother a broker, laid low by the alleged decision of a super-capitalistic, super-private bank to make a commercial decision to try to limit its customer base to people it might happily admit through the front rather than the rear entrance.\n\nWrong again to stand by while a man who always seeks to set such limits on where other people can go and what they can do is excluded from the private bank of his choice. Has no one here read Magna Carta, or watched it on YouTube?\n\nWe can\u2019t be definitive about the racism claim. That\u2019s often made \u2013 and it\u2019s for Farage, his mates and his God to know and to process as they will. Coutts, in its now public internal document, observes that Farage\u2019s \u201ccommentary remains within the law regarding hate speech and arguably on the right side of \u2018glorifying or promoting harmful behaviour\u2019\u201d.\n\nBut we can agree that surely it\u2019s wrong to consider his 2014 statement that any \u201cnormal and fair-minded person would have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door\u201d and confuse that with any hint of xenophobia.\n\nFarage with the infamous pro-Brexit billboard in 2016. Photograph: Phil Toscano/PA\n\nSome will point to the infamous \u201cbreaking point\u201d anti-migrant poster during the Brexit campaign, with its megaphone untruth of using a photo of migrants crossing the Croatia-Slovenia border in 2015 to raise the fear of a mass invasion of Dover. But xenophobia and that kind of toxic rabble-rousing are different. As to how, that\u2019s a discussion for another time, but they are. And so it is right that Farage, in time of need, has our support.\n\nIt\u2019s all so sad. The law prevents private entities from shunning customers on grounds of sex, race, disability or gender, and everyone has the right to a bank account. But where is the law protecting rightwing poison hucksters, who\u2019ve made themselves so objectionable that even hyper capitalists don\u2019t want to touch them?\n\nFarage has his devotees and his show on GB News, but it must hurt when a financial institution that really loves money says \u201cyour money is no good here\u201d \u2013 and really means it. Coutts, meanwhile, surely risks opprobrium. Proper banks launder ill-gotten gains and fight for the stewardship of oligarch cash. Here it is weeding out undesirables.\n\nIt\u2019s a world in flux and crisis, but we are not without agency. If we all fall in behind Farage, we can turn this around.\n\nHugh Muir is the Guardian\u2019s executive editor, Opinion", "tiktoken_token_count": 1137, "llama_token_count": 1349}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Zoe Williams", "title": "Everything I hate is on Twitter \u2013 how can the alternatives compete? | Zoe Williams", "description": "When Elon Musk took over the platform, the downward slide was depressing. But then, the horror may always have been a big part of its appeal\u201cAnd he couldn\u2019t do it. He could not fucking die. How could he leave? How could he go?

He could not fucking die. How could he leave? How could he go? Everything he hated was here.\u201d The end of Philip Roth\u2019s Sabbath\u2019s Theater is a perfect distillation of how many of us felt about Twitter when Elon Musk bought it last October. But I didn\u2019t know that from reading it, even though I have; I knew that because someone faster, smarter, probably younger, with a better memory (@hayleycampbell), put it on Twitter.\n\nSo even though everything I hate is there, so is a lot of what I love. My father never owned a TV, because he said every time you thought you were good at something \u2013 cooking, repartee, being alive \u2013 on the telly, there\u2019d be someone who was better at it than you. I thought that was just an unlovely overhang of a 40s childhood: the whole point of repartee, and indeed cooking and being alive, is that the more people who can do it, the better. Also, I really wanted a TV.\n\nQuite soon after Musk\u2019s purchase of the platform, more of what I hated was there. Donald Trump was readmitted, having been barred to avoid the risk of further incitement of violence after the ambush of the Capitol in 2021 \u2013 and the sheer brazenness of the free speech justification, the tedium of it, was depressing to witness.\n\nBlue ticks were monetised, destroying any trust in verification while generating not much revenue. Some staff walked, some were fired, and the endless pranks of the new owner \u2013 walking into HQ with a sink, sending a turd emoji as an auto response to journalist enquires \u2013 were, again, deadening to watch. A rich-enough man can erode workplace rights yet talk about the work ethic of his staff; he can drag the discourse into a mire and have you debating that as an inalienable freedom; he can engage the whole world in having the wrong conversation.\n\nAnd at the user level, Twitter was rubbish. Long conversations I wasn\u2019t interested in, full of anti-trans prejudice and homespun ick about misremembered feminist lore, flooded my timeline. How could this possibly have been curated \u201cfor me\u201d, when I blocked all that stuff years ago? Was it just a broad-brush algorithm for the middle-aged, or a more precisely targeted goading?\n\nMy direct messages, meanwhile, were full of accounts with pretty avatars touting a scam that was quite novel to me. A young woman who wants to sell you some crypto, but has also just split up with her boyfriend and is drunk: fair play, I\u2019m glad to know this exists as a genre. I\u2019d hate to be the person who still thought internet scamming meant pretending to be a prince who just needs to quickly leave a million dollars in your bank account.\n\nAs alternatives to Twitter sprang up, the question moved on: Mastodon, the so-called \u201cfediverse\u201d, was an early migration option and ticked all the right boxes politically. It can never be bought, is democratically moderated, and (with the caveat that I could probably be using it better) is also nothing like horrible enough. There are more mature faults to find \u2013 it is more sparsely populated, the timelines are quite repetitive \u2013 but the main void is of gleeful spite. Despite hating Twitter, there is something compelling about the horror of it all.\n\nThreads, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s rival network, tied to Instagram, overcame many of those early hurdles just by having more money and being part of an existing platform: almost overnight, it had 100 million users. People with large armies of followers mourned the fact that they would have to start from scratch, but rebuilding didn\u2019t seem as unrealistic as it did on Mastodon. It was also gratifying to see the new platform work so well, having scooped up so many of Twitter\u2019s disgruntled employees, and more pleasing still to see Musk\u2019s half-hearted legal challenge to Zuckerberg on that basis. It turns out there are still kinks in the winner-takes-all capitalist model; your employees are still free to work for your competitors.\n\nEssentially, all these town-square platforms, the rivalries and differences between them, and more importantly the emotional and intellectual investments we make to build them, make questions that have been building for years more pressing. What makes Wikipedia Wikipedia \u2013 an astonishing display of human cooperation and expertise, of both unbelievable richness and winsome peculiarity \u2013 and Facebook Facebook \u2013 a place where people gather to drive each other into unlovely spasms of envy, delusion, triviality and extremism? What is it about the funding models, the governance and the vision that creates such very different experiences from the same raw material: people, participating? Is it as simple as profit motive; and if so, why aren\u2019t all non-profit platforms naturally, atmospherically, better?\n\nIn one way, Musk did everyone who cared about Twitter a favour, teaching us how vulnerable it was to the hooliganism of one ego; but we must figure out some solution better than \u201cboycott and find a hobby\u201d; we don\u2019t need Zuckerberg to teach us that lesson twice.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1064, "llama_token_count": 1242}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Arwa Mahdawi", "title": "\u2018Zuck is a cuck\u2019?!

Elon Musk, a very stable tech genius, is throwing a temper tantrum over Mark Zuckerberg launching the Twitter rival Threads. You would think a capitalist such as Musk would welcome a little healthy competition, but he doesn\u2019t seem keen to compete in the business arena. Instead, he has challenged Zuckerberg to a \u201cliteral dick-measuring contest\u201d. Musk, who is 52 years old, prefaced that invitation by tweeting: \u201cZuck is a cuck.\u201d It\u2019s not clear whether he had professional help crafting this zinger or if it came to him in a flash of brilliance.\n\nHow is Twitter\u2019s new CEO, Linda Yaccarino, enjoying all this, I wonder? She probably thought she would be stewarding a struggling tech company\u2019s return to greatness; instead, she is managing a manbaby\u2019s outbursts. She probably expected she would be leading complex strategy meetings; instead, one imagines, she is being briefed by her underlings about what a cuck is.\n\nPerhaps Yaccarino already knows exactly what a cuck is. It hasn\u2019t escaped notice that the former NBC Universal executive follows a large number of proudly rightwing Twitter accounts including Catturd, whom Rolling Stone once described as \u201cthe shitposting king of Maga Twitter\u201d. If you spend any time in the haunts of the online right, you are bound to hear a lot of cucking; it is one of the most beloved insults of angry white men.\n\nFor those of you who lead healthy offline lives and are not familiar with the term, cuck is slang for a feeble man with progressive-ish views (anyone to the left of Mussolini) and stems from the word \u201ccuckold\u201d, meaning a man whose wife is unfaithful. In 2014, during Gamergate, the antiquated insult was revived on rightwing message boards. (It\u2019s hard to explain Gamergate to anyone who isn\u2019t \u201cextremely online\u201d, but, in brief, a female gaming journalist broke up with her boyfriend, sparking a furiously misogynistic movement that significantly influenced the rise of the modern right.) In 2016, the word gained even more traction in a Reddit message board called r/The_Donald. Donald Trump staffers started using it; Steve Bannon, for example, once called Jared Kushner a cuck. From there, it infiltrated the mainstream.\n\nOver the years, cuck has become a dangerously amorphous term. While it isn\u2019t inherently a white supremacist word, it has taken on racist and antisemitic connotations. For some people, it\u2019s a reference to racist fetish pornography. It\u2019s also, one linguist has argued, a coded way to talk about antisemitic \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theories.\n\nMeanwhile, for others, it\u2019s just a silly word to be used in jest. \u201cWhile it might have once been possible to distinguish out-and-out white supremacists from [so-called] ironic Nazis, now the different groups were learning the same language,\u201d noted Tim Squirrell, an expert in extremism, in a 2017 article about the evolution of cuck.\n\nSay what you will about the far right; they are cunning linguists, alarmingly adept at packaging hateful concepts into silly terms that can be defended as \u201cjust a joke\u201d. \u201cIncels\u201d, for example, routinely talk about women as \u201cfemoids\u201d, a contraction of \u201cfemale humanoid\u201d used to signal that these men don\u2019t consider women to be fully human.\n\nMemes also do a lot of heavy lifting: Pepe the frog, a beady-eyed cartoon amphibian, has been co-opted as an \u201calt-right\u201d hate mascot.\n\nIt\u2019s not just me saying the far right are strategic about how they sanitise hateful language; they have admitted it themselves. In 2017, for example, the style guide for the neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer was leaked. \u201cGenerally, when using racial slurs, it should come across as half-joking,\u201d it instructed. \u201cMost people are not comfortable with material that comes across as vitriolic, raging, nonironic hatred. The unindoctrinated should not be able to tell if we are joking or not.\u201d\n\nSo, was Musk joking when he called Zuck a cuck? Or was it something more sinister? I can\u2019t say for certain. But the fact that one of the world\u2019s richest and most influential men is proudly using far-right terms?

Widely seen as the most important such reform in a generation, it developed in direct response to Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election which came to a violent head in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. Among its many admirable provisions, it prohibits state legislatures from changing how electors can be selected after an election.\n\nThen in one of two positive pieces of supreme court news in recent weeks, the court rejected a dangerous effort to allow states to ignore their own state constitutions. Undeterred, that could have radically transformed how federal elections are conducted by giving state legislatures a great deal of power to set rules for federal elections. The court also unexpectedly struck down Alabama\u2019s racial gerrymandering plan under the Voting Rights Act.\n\nI find it oddly encouraging that, according to a recent USA Today/Suffolk University poll, seven in 10 Americans think our democracy is \u201cimperiled.\u201d Of course, people define that peril according to their own politics and world views, but is is undoubtedly one reason why election denialists were roundly defeated during last year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nAs NBC News\u2019s Adam Edelman put it: \u201cNearly every single candidate in battleground state races who denied or questioned the results of the 2020 election was defeated for positions that oversee, defend and certify elections \u2013 a resounding loss for a movement that would have had the power to overturn future contests.\u201d\n\nMost Americans apparently don\u2019t want extremists running elections and they understand how high the stakes are.\n\n\u201cOur democracy is fortifying itself on many levels,\u201d Greg Sargent of the Washington Post wrote recently. That happened because citizens and government officials took post-2020 threats seriously.\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing that they did, since \u2013 according to one respected organization, the Virginia-based Center for Systemic Peace \u2013 the United States in late 2020 no longer could clearly be categorized as a democracy. It had become, for the first time, an \u201canocracy\u201d, which shares qualities of both autocracy and democracy. America\u2019s rating has more recently improved, putting us back, though not safely, in the democracy zone.\n\nIn media, the continuing loss of local newspapers \u2013 in itself, a serious threat to democracy \u2013 has been offset somewhat as innovation-minded journalists and entrepreneurs have stepped into that void. Witness the growth of digital-first news organizations such as VoteBeat and States Newsroom, and collaborative efforts like Spotlight PA or the partnership between the Texas Tribune and ProPublica.\n\nA recent big pricetag for Fox News \u2013 $787.5m to settle a defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems \u2013 is another encouraging development. It provided some accountability for the way the cable network knowingly spread election-related lies after the 2020 election; when that settlement was followed by Fox\u2019s firing the reprehensible Tucker Carlson, it began to look as if legal challenges could do what advertiser boycotts could not.\n\nThe various criminal prosecutions and investigations to hold the January 6 insurrectionists accountable are heartening as well. Those potentially include Trump himself \u2013 in Washington, in Georgia, and according to the latest news, maybe in Arizona, too. To some degree, the democratic guardrails are holding and the rule of law prevailing.\n\nAnd while this is hard to quantify, I know of many citizens and advocates who are working hard to protect voting, to support the rights of the disenfranchised. to lessen the blows dealt by the recent court rulings, and to sustain local journalism.\n\nIt\u2019s a heavy lift, so we should all lend a hand.\n\n\u201cGet engaged locally,\u201d urged Yale University\u2019s Asha Rangappa told me recently when I interviewed the former FBI agent for my podcast, American Crisis: Can Journalism Save Democracy? That could mean runing for office, signing up to be a poll worker, volunteering at school, participating in the arts.\n\nRangappa wants more Americans to \u201ccultivate the habits of democracy\u201d. Those habits are developed when people leave their social-media echo chambers, get out into their communities, and simply talk to each other.\n\nOn this Fourth of July, let\u2019s make sure our ever-fragile democracy endures to celebrate many more birthdays.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1029, "llama_token_count": 1263}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Margaret Sullivan", "title": "I took RFK Jr\u2019s phone call long ago.

Assassinated in 1968, RFK was long gone, and though we did get some unusual calls in the public editor\u2019s office, they tended to be from the living.\n\nI quickly realized, of course, that the caller was the former New York senator\u2019s son, an environmental attorney then in his late 50s. And, given his prominence, I took the call, only to endure an unpleasant screed from this anti-vaccine crusader. Once Kennedy had my ear, he spun out his pseudo-scientific theories, mostly about the causal relationship between childhood vaccines and autism. Though these notions had been debunked, he was relentless in wanting the New York Times to give them more credence.\n\nMy job as public editor was to represent the readers of the paper and take their complaints seriously, often writing columns about them, but I didn\u2019t do so in this case. As I recall, I just shook off the conversation and got back to work.\n\nThese days, I\u2019m certainly glad I didn\u2019t take up his cause. RFK Jr, now 69 and running for president as a Democrat, has proven himself to be even more divorced from reality.\n\nThe most recent example came just last week, and it was appalling. At a dinner on New York City\u2019s Upper East Side, Kennedy (foolishly) thought he was talking off the record and therefore could drop his guard.\n\nSo he went full conspiracy theory \u2013 suggesting that Covid could have been a bioweapon intended to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people while targeting \u201cCaucasians and Black people\u201d. The remarks, heard on a widely circulated video published by the New York Post, \u201cfeeds into Sinophobic and antisemitic tropes\u201d, an Anti-Defamation League spokesperson told the Washington Post. The director of the Stop Asian Hate Project called them irresponsible and hateful.\n\nKennedy has denied any antisemitic sentiment, or even that he intended that the \u201cethnic effect was deliberately engineered\u201d. But the recording tells a different tale.\n\nIt\u2019s not as if this latest chapter is an aberration. RFK Jr has consistently spread Covid conspiracy theories and even once compared US vaccine mandates \u2013 unfavorably! \u2013 to \u201cHitler\u2019s Germany\u201d. (He later apologized for that one.)\n\nThe New York Times summed him up in a news story: \u201cMr Kennedy has made his political career on false conspiracy theories about not just Covid-19 and Covid vaccines but disproved links between common childhood vaccines and autism, mass surveillance and 5G cellular phone technology, ill health effects from wifi, and a \u2018stolen\u2019 election in 2004 that gave the presidency back to George W Bush.\u201d\n\nSomehow, though, his presidential campaign has gained traction; although a long shot, he does have significant support among primary voters. (And we\u2019ve seen what can happen with a supposed long shot, as Donald Trump was considered in 2015.)\n\nThe reasons are obvious. His crazy ideas \u2013 like Trump\u2019s \u2013 are catnip for the media. They make news and generate clicks. And social media amplifies him, too. Mark Jacob, a former Chicago Tribune editor, put it bluntly: \u201cThe bots and trolls love RFK Jr. Because the bots and trolls hate a fact-based humanitarian society.\u201d\n\nAll of this adds immeasurably to his prominence at a time when Democratic voters are looking for an alternative to Joe Biden, who they think is too old to endure a long campaign and a four-year presidency.\n\nWhich brings me full circle to that decade-old phone call. I wonder now why I so readily took that call and gave him a half hour that rightfully belonged to the ordinary readers of the New York Times? Not every phone call got patched through to me, any more than I personally answered every one of the 500 or so emails that the public editor\u2019s office received each week.\n\nAnd I know the answer: I did it because of his famous name. When I was growing up in the 60s and 70s in the heavily Catholic steel city of Lackawanna, New York, any Kennedy was revered as something of a secular saint. And although we learned much more skepticism after Teddy Kennedy (RFK Jr\u2019s uncle) drove a campaign worker to her watery death in 1969, the name still resonated decades later.\n\nWith his ugly theories and dangerous denials of reality, RFK Jr long ago sullied the family name. And these days, I would ask my assistant to have him send us an email. We would read it with interest \u2013 just like every other complaint we got.\n\nThis article was amended on 18 July 2023 to correct the spelling of Mark Jacob\u2019s surname.", "tiktoken_token_count": 989, "llama_token_count": 1182}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Hephzibah Anderson", "title": "Alison Bechdel: \u2018The Bechdel test was a joke...

DTWOF followed the politics and news of the times, providing a weekly lifeline for queer readers across the US. Now, 40 years on, the trials and triumphs of Bechdel\u2019s tight-knit lesbian ensemble have been given a fresh lease of life in a new audio series, with a cast including Jane Lynch, Carrie Brownstein and Roxane Gay.\n\nDTWOF started in the 1980s. Name one thing from that era that you\u2019re glad to be shot of and another that you miss\n\nI\u2019m glad to be shot of Ronald Reagan, although he did sort of seep out into the next decade. I miss the sense of community \u2013 the very tight-knit subculture that I was able to come out into. I wouldn\u2019t want to go back to that because it was a sign of how embattled we were. We had to form a separate culture, but it had a lot of consolations and was quite wonderful in many ways.\n\nWhat made you decide to end the strip in 2008?\n\nIt was very consuming and I had other things I wanted to do. I wrote the strip until the end of the Bush administration, when I was just exhausted. Little did I know what was to come.\n\nIt\u2019s an epic amount of time to spend with one group of characters. Did you find yourself wondering what they were up to afterwards?\n\nI honestly didn\u2019t think much about them because I was so relieved at that time to have my life open up to other things. But after Donald Trump became president, I did a few self-therapeutic episodes about how the characters were responding and, recently, I\u2019ve been working on another project with them and that\u2019s been really fun.\n\nWhich character do you most closely resemble?\n\nWhen I began writing, I envisioned Mo as an avatar of myself, but I\u2019ve become like her girlfriend, Sydney, the evil women\u2019s studies professor, who\u2019s a more jaded, more worldly character.\n\nWe were so attached to our identity as gay men or as lesbians and it feels like that\u2019s going to be a historical blip\n\nWere you apprehensive about transforming a comic strip into an audio series ?\n\nI didn\u2019t know what was going to happen.

How big have the cultural changes in gay culture been since that time?\n\nIf you look at older gay people and then at the very young gay people, the change is quite marked. My generation made this generation possible but it\u2019s pretty different from how we envisioned it.\n\nIn what way?\n\nWe were so attached to our identity as gay men or lesbians and it feels like that\u2019s going to be a historical blip. If humanity even survives another 100 years, which I\u2019m not so sure of, I think that there\u2019s going to be a lot less attachment to sexual or even gender identity. I think it\u2019s going to be much more fluid and we\u2019ll be fine with it.\n\nA 1987 page from the series Dykes to Watch Out For by Alison Bechdel.\n\nHave you ever considered switching pronouns?\n\nI understand why people want to use \u201cthey\u201d, and I could do that, but I\u2019ve worked so hard to count as a \u201cshe\u201d, I\u2019m going to stick there.\n\nIs it harder to be queer in America these days?\n\nEven a few years ago I was saying: \u201cOh, it\u2019s so hard to convince people how hostile the culture was towards us when we were young,\u201d but now it\u2019s gone off the rails. All these anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ bills that are being passed \u2013 it\u2019s crazy. I don\u2019t want to feed into the people who are sure there\u2019s going to be a civil war.

We\u2019ve got to be vigilant.\n\nGrowing up, your family was in the funeral home business. Did that give you a healthy attitude to mortality?\n\nI felt grateful to have that exposure to death as a routine fact of life because most people don\u2019t have that but I continue to grapple with my own mortality.\n\nDid it influence your sense of humour?\n\nWe would joke about the funeral home \u2013 it was just part of our daily life \u2013 and that definitely shaped me.\n\nWe should talk about the Bechdel test\u2026\n\nIf we must.\n\nHow do you feel about it these days?\n\nIt was a joke.

(Yeah, I know, the last decade has been rough.) And there is simply no way to write this without making the UK, and more specifically, its media ecosystem, look ridiculous. Sorry King Charles, I tried my best.\n\nSo what\u2019s going on? Good question: nobody really knows. But it all started last Saturday when the Sun put out an explosive front-page story claiming that an unnamed but well-known male BBC presenter had been paying a now 20-year-old \u201cmore than \u00a335,000 since they were 17 in return for sordid images\u201d. The British tabloid, which built its brand by featuring topless women on its page 3 for almost 50 years, is not known for being nuanced and restrained. Still, even by the paper\u2019s own questionable standards, the reporting on this was shocking. The Sun rushed out a story suggesting a serious criminal offence, without seeming to possess much of the underlying evidence to support the allegation.\n\nOn Wednesday, after several days of rabid speculation, the presenter at the center of the story was identified by his wife as Huw Edwards in a statement made on his behalf \u2014a household name in the UK. Edwards, who had been suspended by the BBC, is now apparently in hospital \u201csuffering from serious mental health issues.\u201d\n\nThe BBC seem to have no idea how to handle this or even what\u2019s happening; on Wednesday, the BBC\u2019s Six O\u2019Clock News reported that its star journalist had resigned and then had to swiftly issue an on-air correction. Meanwhile, officers at Scotland Yard have concluded there is no evidence suggesting criminality and the young person at the centre of the story has issued a statement saying the allegations are \u201crubbish.\u201d The Sun is backtracking and trying to blame everyone else for misinterpreting their reporting. The whole thing is a mess.\n\nIt\u2019s a mess, but it\u2019s also a microcosm: the story encapsulates the unique tension in the British media between extreme recklessness and extreme restraint. It\u2019s no secret that British tabloids lead the world in rashness. They tear their subjects apart and no tactic is too underhand. See, for example, the famous phone-hacking scandal that brought down Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News of the World 10 years ago. (Murdoch\u2019s News Corp. also owns the Sun). Or see the 2020 suicide of TV presenter, Caroline Flack, who was viciously ripped apart by tabloids before her death.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the tabloids are always rash. In certain instances, and when it comes to certain people, they demonstrate extreme caution. They may publish every possible bit of gossip about Harry and Meghan, for example, but they are careful about what they say when it comes to rumors about other members of the royal family. That may be because the rumours are complete rubbish or it may be because there is an unspoken agreement in the British media that you don\u2019t publish things like that about high-ranking royals.\n\nIt\u2019s not just in reporting about some royals that you see tabloid restraint at work: the likes of the Sun may stop at nothing to drum up drama, but they\u2019re not allowed to say everything they\u2019d like. The reason that Huw Edwards\u2019s identity was a secret for so long wasn\u2019t down to caution by the Sun, it was because of the UK\u2019s rigid media laws.\n\nIn the US, you are free to criticize public figures without worrying too much about getting sued out of existence thanks to the Supreme Court\u2019s 1964 decision in The New York Times v. Sullivan. The landmark ruling limits the extent to which public officials can sue for defamation and even protects newspapers when they print false statements\u2014so long as no \u201cactual malice\u201d is involved. If you\u2019re a public official who wants to sue for defamation in the US, you bear the burden of proof. By contrast, the UK has libel laws which are a lot friendlier to the person who has been written about. The burden of proof lies with whoever authored the claim.\n\nScumbags of various stripes don\u2019t just have Britain\u2019s libel laws on their side, they can also weaponize Britain\u2019s privacy laws to avoid scrutiny. This is particularly true since a landmark privacy ruling by the UK supreme court in February which made it more difficult for the British media to publish information about people subject to criminal investigations. The case centered on a 2016 article by Bloomberg, naming a prominent business executive under investigation by a British regulator. The businessman, known in the legal filings as ZXC, sued Bloomberg, arguing that the media outlet shouldn\u2019t have disclosed his private information because he hadn\u2019t yet been charged with anything in the corruption enquiry. He based his argument on expectations of privacy afforded by the European convention on human rights, and the supreme court sided with him.\n\nThe result of Bloomberg LP v ZXC? A Britain in which it is a lot harder to speak truth to power. Britain is \u201cstumbling toward a system in which tabloids can still peek into celebrities\u2019 bedrooms but serious journalists cannot report on potential wrongdoing at public companies by powerful people,\u201d John Micklethwait, the editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, said in an op-ed following the ruling. \u201cThe courts have now presented the powerful with a path to keep their names out of print for years\u2026This right to privacy is only for those who can afford it; strangely enough, these often tend to be those who have the most to hide.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re an American reading this and are feeling smug about press freedom in the US compared to the UK, then 1) OK, fair. 2) Don\u2019t get too complacent. Conservatives in the US have long been determined to weaken media protections in the US. \u201cI\u2019m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,\u201d Donald Trump declared in 2016. He promised to change the law \u201cso when the New York Times writes a hit piece\u2026we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they\u2019re totally protected.\u201d Conservatives haven\u2019t managed to achieve that yet, but they\u2019re certainly trying. There are a lot of people in the US who would like to follow the UK\u2019s example and make the right to privacy a luxury only the rich and powerful can afford.\n\nThis article was amended on 18 July 2023 to clarify that, in the Bloomberg case, the businessman\u2019s argument for misuse of private information was that he had not been charged with anything in the corruption inquiry.

He is the star turn in the new Apple TV+ seven-part airborne hostage thriller, Hijack, from Criminal/ Litvinenko team George Kay and Jim Field Smith. The problem is that Elba\u2019s character, Sam, is so over-signposted as charismatic and authoritative, it backfires and he becomes one hugely annoying dude.\n\nEven before he saunters on to the plane, Sam is seen successfully charming an airport security woman into allowing a late passenger through (\u201cMiss, how bad can it be?\u201d), when this would never happen, and for good reason. Once on the fictional Kingdom Airlines commercial flight from Dubai to London, he stops another adult passenger playing a video game loudly (\u201cPlease\u201d), giving the unfortunate impression of a jobsworth teacher on a school trip. By the time the hijack starts playing out in real-time, 24-style, and Sam, some kind of alpha business negotiator, starts manipulating the hijackers (led by Neil Maskell), you\u2019re thinking, but would they listen to him? Would they really?\n\nHow to get across that Johnson\u2019s behaviour is shocking to watching Britons who are already all shocked out?\n\nOnce you make peace with the fact that Elba (Stringer Bell! Luther!) is playing a character who\u2019s about as cool as Alan Partridge with added air miles, Hijack isn\u2019t a bad ride. Sure, it takes the concept of implausibility to new heights, and (spoiler alert) it\u2019s all so rigorously bleached of international politics that the motivation for the hijack, once revealed, verges on dull. It\u2019s also true that passengers are reduced to stereotypes (posh bloke, vicar, squabbling couple), and there\u2019s a bulky spaghetti tangle of diversions on the ground (including Archie Panjabi in counter-terrorism, and Max Beesley as a detective who\u2019s also with Sam\u2019s ex), only some of which feel necessary.\n\nStill, the onboard tension and claustrophobia build well, and the pace is cracking. Unlike too many draining, drawn-out streamer thrillers, you don\u2019t watch it feeling as though your soul is being sucked out at 35,000 feet. Ultimately, Hijack has all the dramatic gravitas of a fidget spinner, but it calls itself a thriller and it is.\n\nOn Channel 4, the Dispatches documentary Boris, the Lord & the Russian Spy makes a rookie error right out of the trap. By now, we\u2019ve all learned the hard way not to refer to Boris Johnson as Boris, which makes the former PM sound like a teddy bear whose only crime is to be too cuddly. Other than that, BTLATRS grapples with the same problem suffered by any serious examination of Johnson: how to get across that his behaviour is shocking to watching Britons who quite understandably are already all shocked out, what with lockdown/Partygate and the rest of the ever-churning ethics tsunami to deal with.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s about Johnson and Russian billionaire and former KGB operative Alexander Lebedev and his son, Evgeny. The Lebedevs became influential after taking control of London\u2019s Evening Standard and Independent newspapers a decade or so ago, and some questions in the documentary concern Johnson\u2019s attendance at certain events at the pair\u2019s residences in Umbria. Elsewhere, it covers how M15 intervened to advise against Johnson putting Evgeny into the House of Lords, and the unsuccessful attempt to get the Queen\u2019s office to block the younger Lebedev\u2019s life peerage (it was all forced through by Johnson, who dismissed concerns as anti-Russian xenophobia).\n\nEvgeny Lebedev, AKA Lord Lebedev of Hampton and Siberia, takes his seat in the House of Lords, 2020. PRU/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThis is a tight, compelling 50 minutes, involving former government and M15 spokespeople (the point is made that Alexander Lebedev was sanctioned in Canada in 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine). If it sometimes feels a little stiff, you appreciate the legal sensitivities. Still (and I never thought I\u2019d say this), we don\u2019t see nearly enough of Johnson in footage, images or anywhere else. With his feet held roasting to yet another self-inflicted fire, for once I would have liked considerably more of him.\n\nThe most positive thing to say about labyrinthine crime drama Before We Die (also on Channel 4), based on a Swedish thriller and starting a second five-part series, is that it\u2019s entertainingly immoderate. It stars Lesley Sharp as DI Hannah Laing and Kazia Pelka as crime family boss Dubravka Mimica, who square up to each other like old-school Martina Cole-esque matriarchs.\n\nI say \u201cmatriarchs\u201d because their sons are central to their unbridled mutual venom, which fuels the entire saga. While former intelligence officer Billy (Vincent Regan) works with DI Laing, he\u2019s reduced to the status of emotional support character. All available screen oxygen goes to Hannah and Dubravka slugging it out like Alexis and Krystle in a Bristolian criminal underworld version of Dynasty.\n\nKazia Palka and Lesley Sharp in the \u2018brazenly intemperate\u2019 Before We Die.

In short, don\u2019t come to Before We Die for gritty realism, or indeed any form of realism. While there\u2019s fun to be had with the brazenly intemperate plot, even with Sharp on board there\u2019s no believing a solitary overheated moment.\n\nMobeen Azhar\u2019s BBC Two documentary The Trouble With KanYe looks into Kanye West (now Ye) and how \u201ca once loved artist became a megaphone for hate and division\u201d.\n\nWest has been morphing into a profoundly troubling individual for some time: the White Lives Matter messaging at his Yeezy fashion show; the antisemitism that finally led to brands dumping him; the \u201calt-right\u201d figures (such as America First\u2019s Nick Fuentes) and presidential ambitions (a Jewish former colleague agrees with Azhar that West thinks he can \u201csupersize\u201d what Donald Trump achieved).

Appropriately, Zuckerberg said in an exchange with a mixed martial arts fighter on Threads that Twitter had not taken its chance to become a leading platform.\n\nReplying on his new Threads account to MMA fighter Mike Davis, who had asked if Threads could become bigger than Twitter, Zuckerberg wrote: \u201cIt\u2019ll take some time, but I think there should be a public conversations app with 1bn+ people on it. Twitter has had the opportunity to do this, but hasn\u2019t nailed it. Hopefully we will.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg indicated in another Threads exchange that Twitter had not reached its potential because it had not been a friendly experience for users.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to keep it friendly as it expands. I think it\u2019s possible and will ultimately be the key to its success,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s one reason why Twitter never succeeded as much as I think it should have, and we want to do it differently.\u201d\n\nIn a further thread, he added: \u201cWe are definitely focusing on kindness and making this a friendly place.\u201d\n\nHowever, Meta\u2019s Facebook and Instagram apps have come in for criticism over the years for their moderation standards, including from whistleblower Frances Haugen, who accused the company in 2021 of putting profit over the public good. Last year an inquest into the death of Molly Russell, 14, found that the British teenager had been able to view harmful content on Instagram before taking her own life in 2017.\n\nTwitter has been criticised since it was bought by Musk last October for reinstating previously banned accounts such as those for Donald Trump and the misogynist influencer Andrew Tate. It has also risked turning off users with a number of changes including a move last weekend to limit the number of tweets that account holders can view, as well as blocking the site to people who are not logged in.\n\nMusk, who has more than 146 million followers on Twitter, did not tweet about Threads directly on Thursday, although he appeared to dismiss the \u201cfriendly\u201d approach, tweeting: \u201cIt is definitely preferable to be attacked by strangers on Twitter, than indulge in the false happiness of hide-the-pain Instagram\u201d. Threads users need an Instagram account to use the service.\n\nMeta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said early adopters of the Twitter rival included Jennifer Lopez, Coldplay and American football star Tom Brady as it revealed initial user numbers. The 30 million figure \u2013 after it launched at 7pm EDT in the US on Wednesday and at midnight in the UK \u2013 compares with about 13 million for another Twitter competitor, Mastodon, but is far behind Twitter\u2019s user count of more than 250 million.\n\nThreads closely resembles Twitter visually, although some of the wording has been changed, with retweets called \u201creposts\u201d and tweets called \u201cthreads\u201d. Posts on Threads can be 500 characters long, compared with 280 for most Twitter users, and Meta has said it plans to make the app interoperable with other platforms like Mastodon, meaning users could take their accounts and followers to similar apps.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The night of three byelections gave just enough of a split decision for all sides to claim victory. And by all sides, I do not mean the three main parties in England that each chalked up a win. No, I am referring to the factions currently slugging it out within Labour over the best route to power at the next general election. For them, these results offered something for everyone.\n\nStart with the unexpected Labour failure to capture Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where Sadiq Khan\u2019s ultra-low emission zone, or Ulez \u2013 which imposes a tax on drivers of old, polluting cars \u2013 appears to have provoked enough Tory voters to stay loyal. That will embolden those Labour voices, especially in the trade unions, who warn of a \u201cgreenlash\u201d \u2013 already visible in France, Germany and the Netherlands \u2013 among working people reluctant to pay the price for action on the environment.\n\nThat will give rise to a familiar cry: act on the climate, by all means, but let the cost fall on someone else. The Tories have already spotted the opening, with Jacob Rees-Mogg seeking to brand Labour as the party of \u201chigh, green taxes\u201d. (If the Conservatives follow the lead of other rightwing parties and set their face against any policy to tackle the climate crisis, forget the political impact: the victim will be the planet.)\n\nStill, the Uxbridge result, like the spectacular win in the deep Tory terrain of Selby and Ainsty, will also be seized on in the wider argument over Labour strategy. The fight is between two groups. One says Labour needs to offer a bold, radical vision that will inspire voters and match the scale of the task now facing a country all but broken by 13 years of Conservative rule. The other says that Labour\u2019s primary task is to reassure the electorate that the party has changed since it was so roundly rejected in 2019, and that it must do nothing that risks it being deemed too irresponsible to be trusted with office.\n\nThe second group, enthusiasts for the leadership of Keir Starmer, points to Selby as proof that the current approach is working. The first group, which includes much of the left, cites Uxbridge as evidence that it\u2019s not enough. The Starmerites hit back and say that it was precisely a radical policy popular with the left \u2013 namely Ulez \u2013 that cost them a seat. And round it goes.\n\nWhere you stand on this argument depends on how you view the next election. Will it be a referendum on the merits of Labour \u2013 or will it be what might be called a revulsion election, comparable to the US presidential contest of 2020, when enough Americans were repelled by Donald Trump to do whatever it took to eject him from office? There are good reasons to suggest that the next British general election will be animated by just that kind of revulsion \u2013 at the lies of Boris Johnson, the recklessness of Liz Truss and the damage that the Tories have done: to an ailing NHS and a raft of public services, but above all to the economy, mortgage rates and millions of Britons\u2019 ability to make ends meet.\n\n00:41 Keir Mather becomes youngest MP in Commons after Labour\u2019s historic Selby win \u2013 video\n\nIn this context, the first task of the opposition is to become an acceptable vehicle for that revulsion, to remove all possible obstacles that might stand in the way of voters thinking of crossing over from right to left. Joe Biden pulled that off for the Democrats: he offered none of the charisma or oratorical fire of Barack Obama; he excited almost nobody. But he was inoffensive, leaving a small barrier for any would-be defector to clear.\n\nStarmer has clearly effected the same transformation in Labour, and at an exceptional speed and scale. Recall that the Labour defeat in 2019 was the heaviest since 1935; many forecasted that Johnson would be in Downing Street for a decade. Yet less than four years later, Labour has overturned a 20,000 Tory majority in North Yorkshire.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat win in Somerton and Frome is part of the same success story. Lib Dems do best when Labour is viewed as sufficiently unscary that voters in previously Conservative seats feel able to turf out a Tory MP. (It was no coincidence that the Lib Dems reached their high-water mark in the era of Tony Blair.) They did not feel that way in 2019, which is why a lot of remain-minded \u201cblue wall\u201d constituencies stuck with a Tory party promising to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d.\n\nBut Starmer does not scare them. The result is the kind of tactical voting on Thursday that saw Lib Dems lend their votes to Labour in the north of England, with Labour supporters returning the favour in the West Country \u2013 depriving the Tories of two rock-solid seats. It is efficient tactical voting that walloped the Conservatives in May\u2019s English local elections \u2013 \u201cblue wall\u201d seats for the Lib Dems, \u201cred wall\u201d for Labour \u2013 and which could remove Rishi Sunak from power.\n\nAll of which will hearten the leadership as the party gathers in Nottingham for its National Policy Forum this weekend. They will say that it is their efforts to shake off the legacies of the Jeremy Corbyn years that have delivered double-digit opinion poll leads and massive byelection swings to Labour, and that they have been right to strive for fiscal credibility \u2013 even when that means having to forswear promises the party would dearly love to make, such as a commitment to overturn the Conservatives\u2019 two-child benefit cap, a policy Labour once called \u201cheinous\u201d.\n\nThis argument \u2013 that when faced with a revulsion election, caution and minimalism are the wisest course \u2013 has plenty to commend it. Voters are more frightened now than they were in 1996, on the eve of New Labour\u2019s landslide win: the economy is doing worse, and they need more reassurance. The revulsion is more intense now than then, too: Johnson\u2019s lies outstrip any John Major-era sleaze. And the electorate is more sceptical, even cynical, of big promises. Johnson said Brexit would bring wealth and sunshine, and it hasn\u2019t; the Tories said they would level up, and they haven\u2019t.\n\nLabour faces a nation that has lost faith in the notion that politics can change anything \u2013 and, if it wins power, it will not have at its disposal the cash that was around in the late 1990s. For all those reasons, to say nothing of Starmer\u2019s own personality, it makes sense that, as one senior Labour figure puts it, the party offers \u201cno Obama visions\u201d.\n\nBut the combination of revulsion and reassurance is not, on its own, sufficient for victory. As Uxbridge shows, one big local issue can be enough to stop the traffic from Tory to Labour. Voters are clearly being pushed away from the Conservatives, but they need to be pulled to Labour too. Not by grandiose, impossible dreams, but by a few costed, immediately understandable pledges that illustrate how life would be better under a Labour government. (The Nottingham meeting will be part of that effort.) These byelections show that Starmer has already done something remarkable, taking Labour ever closer to Downing Street.

The United States forward announced earlier in July that this World Cup, her fourth, will also be her last. She will retire later this year after playing out the National Women\u2019s Soccer League season with her club, OL Reign.\n\nAs with just about everything Rapinoe has done on and off the field in her glittering career, she is going out her way, on her terms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just grateful to be able to do it in this way,\u201d Rapinoe said. \u201cI understand that it is incredibly rare for athletes of any stature to be able to go out in their own way, on their own terms, at the time that they want, in a way that feels really peaceful and settled for them.\u201d\n\nRegardless of what happens over the next month, as Rapinoe and Co aim to win an unprecedented third consecutive World Cup, the 38-year-old will walk away as one of the all-time greats in a program littered with them.\n\nShe may also be the most famous women\u2019s player in history thanks to her advocacy off the field. Rapinoe is a steadfast fighter for equality and inclusion, which has inspired many and drawn the ire of others.\n\nAs teammate Kelley O\u2019Hara said this week while holding back tears: \u201cShe\u2019s one of a kind. There\u2019s never been one like her, there\u2019s probably never going to be one close to her.\u201d\n\nRapinoe reached a level of global fame four years ago when, with her unmistakable purple-pink hair, she led the USA\u2019s campaign at the 2019 World Cup, scoring six goals while winning the Golden Ball as the tournament\u2019s best player. That tournament marked an explosion of the team\u2019s fame and Rapinoe\u2019s celebrity, but the flame had been lit years earlier.\n\nIn 2011, with the US trailing Brazil in the 122nd minute of the World Cup quarter-final, Rapinoe hit a desperate cross to the back post that found the head of Abby Wambach for the equalizer. The moment was quintessential, never-say-die USWNT attitude \u2013 and was later voted the greatest Women\u2019s World Cup goal of all time. The Americans eventually advanced to the final, where they lost to Japan.\n\nEven before that match, without the comfort of having established her place on the team, Rapinoe was a bold personality. After scoring against Colombia in the group stage, she ran to one of the on-field microphones, picked it up and tapped it, and belted out a line from Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Born in the USA.\n\nOne year later, Rapinoe helped the US win a third consecutive Olympic gold medal. Among her feats was an Olimpico \u2013 a goal straight from a corner kick \u2013 in the controversial extra-time win over Canada in the semi-final. Rapinoe scored another Olimpico at the Tokyo Games in 2021, a repeat trick which US Soccer believes has never been replicated at that level.\n\nIn between, she won the 2015 World Cup and refined her game with the Reign in Seattle. Her style of play was, and is, defined by audacity and ingenuity, from Olimpicos and unlikely free kicks (she surprised France with a near-post effort in the 2019 World Cup quarter-final) to quick throw-ins that produce assists. She is the type of player who will try anything once \u2026 and nobody will question it.\n\nThe 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup was a defining tournament for Megan Rapinoe. Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPerhaps more famously, Rapinoe has also left her mark off the field. She is one of the world\u2019s most famous out gay athletes, and fights fiercely for the LGBTQ+ community. She has also raised issues around race: in 2016, she knelt during the national anthem in solidarity with former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who did the same at the time in protest of social injustices. US Soccer proceeded to drop her from the team and create a rule (which was soon repealed) requiring all players to stand for the national anthem \u2013 \u201cWhite people were mad. Whew, were they mad!\u201d she later wrote in her memoir.\n\nThen came 2019, when her life forever changed. With the team already mired in a bitter, high-profile equal-pay lawsuit with their own federation, Rapinoe said in an interview \u2013 which was held for release until the World Cup \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not going to the fucking White House.\u201d She meant if the team won the World Cup, and she said it as a direct shot at then-US president Donald Trump.\n\nTrump took to Twitter to say, \u201cMegan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job!\u201d. Trump claimed Rapinoe was disrespecting the country, and she became the face of a now polarizing US team that stood for inclusion, against a sizable group of conservatives. The US did win, of course, with Rapinoe striking an arms-extended pose after each of her six goals in the tournament.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Soccer with Jonathan Wilson Free weekly newsletter Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She never took herself too seriously.\n\n\u201cI know that the world sees the Megan Rapinoe that the world sees, but we get to see her up close and personal,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. \u201cObviously, the \u2018Pinoe\u2019 that the world sees is an incredible person and human, and that is her also up close and personal. She brings a sense of humor and lightness but [also] intensity and empathy.\u201d\n\nRetirement has been in Rapinoe\u2019s mind ever since that World Cup triumph in Lyon four years ago. Everything she did was scrutinized and she felt stuck in the hamster wheel of professional sports. Emotionally, spiritually and physically, she was taxed. Ongoing injuries further limited her production and stripped her of her joy in the game.\n\nNow, on a team that has been gutted and remodeled over the past 18 months, Rapinoe is part of the supporting cast. She will mostly come off the bench with the expectation that she can change games in the final minutes with that usual flair and audacity, whether it be another pinpoint cross or a perfect free-kick. Starting and starring roles? Those are unlikely, but she is fine with that.\n\nShe accepted as much last year when she returned to the team for World Cup qualifying after a hiatus. The team had transitioned to a new generation \u2013 14 of the 23 players on the US roster this month are at their first World Cup \u2013 and Sophia Smith and Mallory Swanson had taken over as the clear, in-form starters on the wings of the USA\u2019s 4-3-3 formation.\n\nRapinoe had become a mentor, a player-coach. If that\u2019s what it takes to win another World Cup, that\u2019s fine with her.\n\n\u201cRosters are not a compilation just of, go pick the best players and hope for the best,\u201d Rapinoe said last year upon her return to the team. \u201cIt\u2019s about constructing an organism that works together on and off the field, that works not necessarily harmoniously all the time, but that the right pieces fit for certain reasons and for reasons most people don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nThe USA are among the favorites once again, but they are not without considerable questions, driven by injuries (including Swanson) and tactical uncertainty. If they are to win another World Cup, they will do so largely on the backs of a new, emerging generation, from Smith up top to Naomi Girma in defense.\n\nRapinoe will not be front and center as she was four years ago. But she\u2019ll be integral to whatever the team does, rallying the team in huddles and locker rooms and, potentially, making one last game-changing play.\n\n", "tiktoken_token_count": 1711, "llama_token_count": 1963}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "David Smith in Sarasota, Florida", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s my Florida too\u2019: Pulse shooting survivor Brandon Wolf on being Black, gay and the anti-Ron DeSantis", "description": "Since losing his best friend in the 2018 nightclub attack, Wolf has become an outspoken advocate for gun safety and LGBTQ+ rightsSeven years after surviving the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, and dealing with the guilt of losing his best friend\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/14/brandon-wolf-florida-desantis-lgbtq-gun-safety", "text": "Seven years after surviving the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, and dealing with the guilt of losing his best friend there, Brandon Wolf is living life to the fullest. He belongs to an energized generation of young Democrats. He is a prominent gun safety and LGBTQ+ civil rights activist and, at just 34, is a newly published author.\n\nBut in Governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s Florida, he does not always feel safe.\n\n\u201cI have not looked over my shoulder this much since the days after Pulse,\u201d Wolf says via Zoom from a neatly furnished apartment in Orlando. \u201cIt\u2019s because you never know if the person who\u2019s calling you a paedophile in the Twitter mentions is now wandering the aisles of Publix with a gun they learned how to use on YouTube. You never know if the people hopped up on that transphobic hysteria that the governor keeps pumping out are the same ones that are going to show up to an event that you\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nWolf had sought refuge in Florida 15 years ago when he was done with rural Oregon, the childhood home where he suffered embedded racism and homophobia on a daily basis. As he writes in a recently published memoir, A Place for Us, his biological father, a Black man, abandoned him before learning his name and his mother, who was white, died from cancer when he was a boy. He was then raised by white parents. His siblings, classmates and neighbours were white.\n\nThe young Wolf never got \u201cthe talk\u201d about how to engage with police as a Black man or the chance to talk openly about his recurring nightmares of burning crosses and mutilated Black bodies hanging from trees. Nor could he publicly come out in Oregon despite the whispers and rumours he\u2019d shrugged off for years. Among his motivations for writing the book was to reclaim intersectionality from DeSantis and others on the right who seek to hijack it.\n\nHe explains: \u201cI wanted to give a human flavour to what intersectionality actually looks and feels like and what it feels like to experience racism and homophobia at the same time. Growing up in a conservative majority white town was difficult because the same kid who would call me the N-word on one day would call me a homophobic slur on another day and I was constantly navigating the intersections of those two things.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I was sitting around a dinner table with my family, who was also conservative and white, and there were just moments where we were never going to understand each other.\n\n\u201cAlthough I had a roof over my head, a warm place to lay my head every night, it just didn\u2019t ever feel like home and that can be isolating for a young person and ultimately that\u2019s what drove me to move 3,000 miles from home.\u201d\n\nWolf\u2019s book has been praised for its raw honesty and vulnerability. He describes in harrowing detail surviving a sexual assault that he has never told his family about before (\u201cThat was probably the hardest story in the book to write\u201d). He recalls the palpable fear when his car was pulled over by police who falsely accused him of disrespect and ended with a callous epithet: \u201cFucking faggot.\u201d\n\nBrandon Wolf looks at the photos that are a part of the Pulse memorial in Orlando, Florida, on Sept. 9, 2022. Photograph: Cody Jackson/AP\n\nThen there is the Pulse nightclub shooting on 12 June 2016. By chance, Wolf had stepped into the bathroom when the gunman Omar Mateen entered the club and opened fire, killing 49 people in the deadliest attack affecting the LGBTQ+ community in American history.\n\nAmong them were Wolf\u2019s best friend, Drew Leinonen, to whom the book is dedicated, and Leinonen\u2019s boyfriend, Juan Guerrero. Some of Wolf\u2019s memories of the event are foggy; others remain vivid, from the painted faces of familiar drag queens on a poster to a clear plastic cup resting on the rim of the sink and containing ice chips and mutilated slices of lime.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama came to pay his respects, Wolf lost his composure. He writes: \u201cI buried my face in the shoulder of his pressed navy suit, blubbering into the soft, brushed fabric. His hug was firm and consoling. His shirt smelled faintly of cologne. Someone joked that he could be my father, and I chuckled, the first time I can remember laughing that week.\u201d\n\nWolf still revisits the Pulse site from time to time. He explains: \u201cIt comes with so much pain and grief, so many memories. I still do like to go there late at night when no one else is there when it\u2019s quiet, because it\u2019s almost as if I can feel like I\u2019m in the presence of my best friends, if for just a moment.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, the stealing of human life weighs less on [politicians\u2019] scale than access to wealth, power and fame\n\nIt was the deadliest US mass shooting by a single gunman until, just over a year later, 60 people perished at a music festival in Las Vegas. There has since been more bloodshed at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, a school in Parkland, Florida, a school in Uvalde, Texas, and other cradles of lost innocence too long to list.\n\nWolf says he is unsurprised because it has become all too clear that the current generation of political leaders is uninterested in solving the problem. \u201cAt the end of the day, the stealing of human life weighs less on their scale than access to wealth, power and fame. The situation is maybe in their mind too hard to solve, too complicated to solve. It comes with too much political cost if they speak out and so they do nothing and it will continue.\n\n\u201cThe number of communities touched by gun violence, the number of people\u2019s home towns that trend on social media, will escalate until, unfortunately, we get a new generation of leadership who doesn\u2019t know any different than active shooter drills and their best friends\u2019 names on concrete walls somewhere etched forever.\u201d\n\nDoes there need to be systemic change? \u201cI hope that we look back on this day with that same level of disdain for the way in which we allowed those [tobacco] companies and that lobbying industry to have a death grip on our children, because ultimately what tipped the scale in the fight against the tobacco industry was the way in which they were marketing their product to children and it was stealing the lives of young people across the country. You had an uprising.\u201d\n\nWolf introduces Vice-President Kamala Harris during the United Against Hate Summit in the East Room of the White House in September 2022. Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nWolf, who was a national surrogate for Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign in 2019, has been pleasantly surprised by Joe Biden\u2019s efforts on gun safety and LGBTQ+ rights. But as a resident of Florida, he has witnessed up close a Republican backlash in the form of book bans, attacks on Black people\u2019s voting rights and a law allowing Floridians to carry concealed guns without a permit.\n\nDeSantis\u2019s efforts to out-Trump Donald Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary are further turning up the heat. In May the NAACP issued a travel advisory for Florida, highlighting hostility toward Black, ethnic and queer communities. Last month DeSantis\u2019s campaign released an anti-LGBTQ+ video assailing Trump for his past support of gay and transgender people.\n\nWolf comments: \u201cIt is a scary time to be not just LGBTQ but LGBTQ and Black in this state and ultimately that\u2019s the intent. So many of these laws, so much of the rhetoric is about fear, intimidation, bullying a majority of the population into submission so the minority can impose their values on everyone else.\n\nIt is a disgrace to have a governor like Ron DeSantis that makes people look over their shoulders to win political points\n\n\u201cI have to think, as a pretty privileged person to live in downtown Orlando and be a cisgender man in America, if I\u2019m looking over my shoulder, I know that young people are looking over their shoulders. I know that other Black and brown folks are looking over their shoulders. I know that other queer people are looking over their shoulders.\n\n\u201cAnd quite frankly it is a disgrace to have a governor like Ron DeSantis that makes people look over their shoulders to win political points. It is a disgrace to have someone like that turning his own residents into refugees fleeing to the north-east so they can get access to healthcare, send their kids to a school that\u2019s going to treat them with respect.\u201d\n\nDeSantis has been clear about his ambition to use Florida as blueprint for the nation. Wolf believes he knows exactly what that would look like. \u201cThat looks like the US Department of Education banning books about people across the country, not just in Florida, but in New York City, in Los Angeles and in Seattle too.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the US Department of Health and Human Services banning healthcare for trans kids, restricting access to healthcare for trans adults. It looks like trying to ram a near-total abortion ban through Congress so that he can sign it into law. It looks like probably using the US Department of Treasury as a weapon against any business that speaks out in dissent to his policies like he did with Disney.\n\n\u201cIt looks like using the IRS as a tool against the Bud Lights of the world for daring to hire a trans person to put something on their Instagram profile. That is the vision for America that Ron DeSantis has.\u201d\n\nPeople attend the 2nd annual Dunedin Pride Golf Cart Parade in Dunedin, Florida, in June.

He says it is still the same Orlando that he fell in love with \u2013 but he recognises that this is a different Florida.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honoured to be in Orlando, which I see as the seat of the resistance to Ron DeSantis\u2019s rightwing brand of politics. I\u2019m honoured to be able to lift the stories of LGBTQ people every single day, and Florida is my home. I chose this place 15 years ago because I wanted somewhere to belong and I fell in love with Orlando. I fell in love with my friends, my community. I fell in love with the state of Florida.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cNo matter what kind of response that elicits, I did fall in love with Florida. It is my home and it\u2019s my Florida too so I\u2019m not just going to hand it over to Ron DeSantis and his rightwing allies. They\u2019re going to have to pry the white sandy beaches from my hands.

Moving to a new site would be an enormous risk for users because you would lose your network of friends. The network\u2019s entire existence, the theory goes, is secured by these barriers to starting afresh at a new outlet.\n\nThis was how the Guardian described Myspace in 2007, when the early social network had 150 million global users, a number so large it was considered improbable that they would ever move elsewhere. (In the end Myspace was soon overtaken by Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook, Rupert Murdoch lost almost all the money he spent buying the site, and Myspace\u2019s once-ubiquitous founder Tom Anderson has travelled the world on the profits ever since.)\n\nSixteen years later, Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter is also testing the theory that people remain loyally addicted to their favoured social network until suddenly, one day, they give up and move elsewhere. This weeek Zuckerberg launched Threads, a new platform aimed at winning over people who, in the words of one executive, want somewhere a bit like Twitter that is \u201csanely run\u201d.\n\nAfter a day using Threads, one thing is pretty clear: it is not Twitter. But Threads has the potential to be something different and powerful: Twitter with fewer rough edges, more corporate sheen, and enough potential to suck the remaining life \u2013 and advertising revenue \u2013 out of Musk\u2019s struggling network.\n\nThe biggest difference is that Threads feels substantially less confrontational, less aggressive, and less based around shouting at strangers with different political views than Twitter. The racism, antisemitism, transphobia and general abuse that is prevalent on Twitter is just nowhere near as visible. Zuckerberg told a user on the site that this was a design feature: \u201cThe goal is to keep it friendly as it expands \u2026 That\u2019s one reason why Twitter never succeeded as much as I think it should have, and we want to do it differently.\u201d\n\nThreads has also solved the problem of starting a social network from scratch by borrowing an existing one from Instagram. Any existing Instagram user can sign up and swiftly reconnect their followers on the photo-sharing app, meaning Threads is not plagued by the sense that you\u2019ve just turned up at a new school without friends. (In a strange benefit of Brexit for British users, EU countries are currently banned from signing up to Threads due to this feature potentially breaching Brussels\u2019 data rules.)\n\nThe flipside is that, at the moment, no one is entirely sure why they are using Threads. Broadly speaking, three groups are dominating the site: users known for posting photos on Instagram that have unexpectedly gained an enormous audience on a text-centric app; social media managers at companies desperate to retain relevance by jumping on the hot new thing; and people fleeing Twitter\u2019s increasingly toxic environment. All of them have a different idea of what they want from the site. A large chunk of the first day\u2019s posts consisted of people asking why they had signed up.\n\nThreads also lacks the immediacy of Twitter, with the app\u2019s main news feed currently only featuring an algorithmically generated summary of recent posts. Until this feature is changed to allow users to prioritise material published in the last few minutes, it limits the site\u2019s use as a home for breaking news. When Keir Starmer was heckled at an event in Gillingham on Thursday morning, the clip was immediately all over Twitter. But it was far less visible on Threads, which also currently lacks a text search function.\n\nInstead, Threads is more like a cross between Twitter and Instagram, with a TikTok-style focus on juicing engagement from posts. You are more likely to see a funny post from the Archbishop of Banterbury meme account than an earnest discussion about a political intervention by his Church of England equivalent.\n\nAll of this is bad news for Twitter under Musk, which could retreat even further into being a home for rightwing libertarians arguing over culture war topics. At its best, the experience of being on Twitter in the mid-2010s felt like being able to drop in on the funniest, most interesting party in town. It proved to be one of the best media regulators that has ever existed, a perfect place to rapidly call out shoddy journalism and political lies. It was not necessarily the place where the vast majority of the world found out about things \u2013 that was Facebook \u2013 but Twitter was probably where the information was posted first.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Archie Bland and Nimo Omer take you through the top stories and what they mean, free every weekday morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But crowding a lot of different communities with strongly held interests into the same online house party has its flaws. Anger and fury turned out to be the best way to go viral and reach an audience. Donald Trump used the site as a megaphone to swamp the media zone in his run to the White House.\n\nUltimately, Threads\u2019s launch might be just be another step in the disintegration of the social media scene of the 2010s and its rebirth as a more sanitised advertiser-friendly environment, rather than a messy free-for-all discussion.\n\nZuckerberg said he hoped Threads would overtake Twitter\u2019s 250 million monthly users. \u201cIt will take some time, but I think there should be a public conversation app with 1 billion+ people on it,\u201d he said. \u201cTwitter has had the opportunity to do this but hasn\u2019t nailed it.

In his early years as a TV journalist and nightly news anchor, Kumar did not imagine that he would live to be part of a modern-day Nineteen Eighty-Four nightmare. But that changed almost a decade ago with the election of Narendra Modi\u2019s government in India. In the years since then, Kumar has become an increasingly lone voice of truth-telling in an Indian media landscape in thrall to the Hindu nationalist politics of Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). Kumar\u2019s one-man campaign to maintain journalistic integrity, as mainstream news organisations became promoters of politicised fake news, earned him the \u201cNobel prize of Asia,\u201d the Ramon Magsaysay award, in 2019. It also led to an unending campaign of harassment and death threats from government supporters.\n\nKumar, the Indian equivalent of, say, Jeremy Paxman in his prime, finally resigned from his post at NDTV in New Delhi last November, after the station was taken over by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, a close friend of Modi. He now lives in virtual hiding with his family and broadcasts through a personal YouTube channel. His story, one of repression in modern India and of the existential crisis in truth-telling worldwide, is the subject of an urgently compelling documentary, While We Watched.\n\nRavish Kumar in While We Watched. Photograph: \u24b8 Britdoc Films\n\nThe director of that documentary, Vinay Shukla, tells me he knew he had to make his film when he turned on to watch Kumar\u2019s news show back in 2018: Kumar interrupted the bulletin to berate his own viewers, telling them they had to start questioning the lies they were being fed, had to stop watching TV and look for information from other more reliable sources. \u201cMost news presenters are always praising their audience, saying: \u2018We are here to serve you\u2019 and so on,\u201d Shukla says. \u201cRavish, on the contrary, was chastising his audience, saying: \u2018You\u2019re the problem.\u2019 I could see that here was an unusual protagonist \u2013 this huge figure in the [Indian] media \u2013 who has begun to wonder if the society for whom he is doing this work even cares for him any more.\u201d\n\nFor the next two years, Shukla, who had previously made an award-winning documentary about the creation and struggle of an Indian opposition party, An Insignificant Man, essentially moved in with Kumar, filming him five days a week over that period. The result is an intimate portrait of a man struggling to preserve his conscience and freedom in the face of overwhelming hostility and political and commercial cynicism; a man trying, in Orwell\u2019s terms, at 9pm every night, to tell the nation that two plus two actually equals four.\n\nWhen I speak to Ravish Kumar himself on a long Zoom call, he describes himself now being \u201cin exile\u201d in his own country. He assumes our call is being monitored by his tormentors; before he joined it, he received the usual anonymous texts saying: \u201cWe will see you.\u201d Once he left NDTV in November, he became \u201cpersona non grata\u201d in Indian media, he says. He continues to try to get at the truth in the world\u2019s largest democracy, researching and writing \u201cabout 8,000 words a day\u201d for his YouTube broadcasts.\n\nI wonder, looking back, when he first felt that things were falling apart? \u201cIt was June or July 2014,\u201d he says. \u201cI sensed that a kind of avalanche was coming in Indian media. At that time, many of my colleagues would say: \u2018Well, power comes and power goes.\u2019 And: \u2018We have enough experience, Ravish, we have seen many leaders.\u2019 But my gut was saying: \u2018No, this is not something that has happened before. Something new is coming.\u2019 In a very short span of time, the structures of newsrooms were demolished completely. That was not done step by step. It was done in one go.\u201d\n\nShukla\u2019s film contrasts Kumar\u2019s meticulous efforts at reporting sectarian violence, or the desperate conditions in rural villages, with the shouty populist news channel Republic, which quickly became the Fox News of Indian media after Modi was elected prime minister. Republic\u2019s excitable presenters are seen to fuel division and mistrust of the country\u2019s minority (200 million) Muslim population, to routinely call political opponents of the BJP traitors, to promote warmongering against Pakistan and to neglect to report on the complex issues faced by ordinary Indians. In its manufactured culture wars and unhinged sloganeering, it is, you sense, the channel GB News aspires to be.\n\nNow 51, Kumar, a history graduate, had by 2014 been at NDTV for 15 years, having risen from the mail room to become its most trusted and recognisable face. For a long time, the station supported his mission to call out what was happening elsewhere in the media. \u201cNDTV started running a campaign that said: \u2018We do not profit from hate,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe owners were trying to save their core values. But in that process, everything became very tough. It was very tedious to always defend themselves.\u201d Within the station, Kumar occasionally came under pressure to moderate his tone. \u201cBut if I said no to an editor,\u201d he says, \u201cthey took it at once that this is my final word.\u201d\n\nThe aftermath of sectarian clashes in Delhi in February 2020 between Hindus and Muslims protesting a contentious new citizenship law. Photograph: Rajesh Kumar Singh/AP\n\nDid it come as a shock to him how shallow the ethical foundations of much of the media proved to be? \u201cI wasn\u2019t shocked,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I was very pained and deeply hurt that no one stood up to stop this. A lot of [journalists] started making adjustments and those adjustments led them into that room with no windows, only the voice of command, saying: \u2018You have to do this.\u2019 And that is what they did.\u201d\n\nThe film records something of the inside story of that playbook of fake news that we have all witnessed happening in plain sight: the undermining of properly sourced information across social media, the seeding of conspiracy theories, the targeting of individual journalists and organisations. There were, and remain, pockets of resistance to this pressure, Kumar insists: \u201cBut the force of avalanche was such that nobody was untouched in their newsroom, whether he was a senior reporter or whether he was an intern.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m a very fearful person. I wasn\u2019t ready to handle that mental trauma. It destroyed me\n\nKumar\u2019s eventual resignation is referenced in the recent scathing Index on Censorship report into the escalating repression by Modi\u2019s populist government. \u201cIt has the structures of democracy but it has weakened democracy\u2019s functions\u2026 it has a media which is eager to demonstrate how nationalistic and patriotic it is in order to curry favour with the ruling party.\u201d\n\nThat determination is fuelled in part by fear. Seven journalists are now in prison in India and many more have been subject to targeted harassment; eight journalists at the Wire website were charged with sedition in 2021 for reporting that the family of a protester, killed at an anti-government rally, believed he was shot by police. Other news organisations have been subject to blackouts, while some have been raided by police, including the BBC offices in Delhi and Mumbai, which appear to have been singled out after the corporation produced a two-part investigation into Modi\u2019s alleged history in sectarian violence. India \u2013 the world\u2019s most populous nation \u2013 has been consequently sliding down the UN\u2019s human rights tables; among the top 10 nations that jails writers and journalists, it is the only \u201cnominally democratic\u201d one, according to PEN, the international charity that supports freedom of expression.\n\nA threat received by Ravish Kumar, as shown in While We Watched. Photograph: Britdoc Films\n\nShukla\u2019s film examines the effect that the wider climate had on Kumar\u2019s mental health. \u201cI\u2019m a very fearful person,\u201d he insists, in the face of plenty of evidence to the contrary. \u201cI had this strong feeling that I should not do anything immoral, but I wasn\u2019t ready to handle that mental process. It destroyed me. When they launched [the continuous] attacks on me on social media, I could not handle it. I was very terrified, petrified. NDTV understood I needed security \u2013 but I also needed counselling. I stopped sleeping. I was awake all the time assessing the threat to my life and my family.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the constant wave of texts and calls from people promising to cut his throat, Kumar was pushed around in the street while working. On one occasion he was chased down the road by men with clubs and iron bars, only just making it to his car. The family \u2013 his wife is an academic and they have two teenage daughters \u2013 stopped going out together; on the rare occasions they did, he would walk on the other side of the street so they would not all be subjected to any attack.\n\nIf TV news is designed to desensitise you, I wanted to use the same form and sensitise people Vinay Shukla, director\n\nWatching all that again on Shukla\u2019s film, he says, was almost too much for him to bear. \u201cThe first time, I had to shut my eyes because I could not see myself again, going through that process. My daughters haven\u2019t watched it yet,\u201d he says, \u201cMy wife saw it and she was very saddened too, but she\u2019s a rational person. She said that people who watched the film would be able to see the story of any journalist, not just me.\u201d He smiles a little ruefully. \u201cThe other thing I was surprised and amused about,\u201d he says, \u201cwas that I finally saw what Vinay had been doing filming me for so many months and years. I used to tell him every day that my life was not exciting: who wants to watch a man get up from the bed and go to work?\u201d\n\nDirector Vinay Shukla.\n\nThe director trusts that his story has a wider reference than that. \u201cI think of the film,\u201d Shukla says, \u201cas my love letter to journalism, so that people understand, really, the price that proper journalists have to pay to be able to do their job. We are living in a time of disinformation. The dehumanisation of journalists is [part of that].\u201d\n\nShukla is just about of the generation who came of age with social media. \u201cI used to watch the news,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it used to make me anxious all the time.\u201d Much of that anxiety, he suggests, is built-in with the attention deficit structure of television news channels, which jump quickly between crisis and disaster and outrage. He has used the fast-cut techniques for his own film \u2013 but in order to dwell thoughtfully on a single life. \u201cThere are lots of quick cuts [in While We Watched] but I was hoping to have the opposite impact. If TV news is designed to desensitise you, I wanted to use the same form and sensitise people, to do the complete opposite.\u201d\n\nHe sees an increasing desire for that kind of slowness and depth of inquiry among an emerging generation of Indian documentary-makers, who are using the form as a counterpoint to the noisy chatter of the mainstream media; presenting proper complexity as a political act. Kumar recognises that opportunity and is encouraged to be exhibit A in it.\n\n\u201cI hope that whoever watches this film will see that resistance is possible,\u201d he says. In the film, he insists that even if one person witnesses the truth, then the political and sectarian lies cannot prevail. \u201cI have a very deep sense of gratitude to the community of viewers who support me,\u201d he says. \u201cThey offered me anything, from a car, to a house, to money, to food. We do not know how many journalists have sacrificed their lives around the world to save this profession. I hope this film brings a ray of hope that it is not easy to kill journalism.\u201d\n\nThe film is released in the UK and the US this month. Shukla is working hard to get it shown in India, lobbying cinemas and streaming platforms, referencing the documentary awards it has won at the Toronto international film festival and elsewhere. Still, as Kumar says, the culture of fear is such that: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that anyone is saying: \u2018Bring your film, I will put your big poster for it on the front of my cinema hall.\u2019\u201d Even so, he suggests, he is confident that the film will be seen: \u201cLots and lots of people have been asking me how they will be able to see this film in India. Everyone should watch this film. Mr Modi should watch this film.\u201d\n\nA video on Kumar\u2019s YouTube channel, which has more than 6m subscribers. Photograph: Ravish Kumar / Youtube\n\nKumar is not hopeful that fundamental changes in the news media in India \u2013 equivalent to the dismantling of the BBC \u2013 can be reversed. The vested interests, including at his old channel NDTV, are now too great. The politically favoured billionaires have taken over.\n\nThere\u2019s a point in the film where he suggests that \u201cpeople don\u2019t question what they see on TV\u201d. Given some of the extremes of what they now see, does he imagine that they may start to question that more? \u201cTo destroy Indian democracy,\u201d Kumar says, \u201cIndian media destroyed itself first. And it\u2019s now very difficult to change this, even if there is a regime change. The news anchors who are spreading hate lies will not go away overnight. This media will never return for democracy. That\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nHe does believe, however, that politics may find a way to bypass those structures. \u201cThe problem with social media,\u201d he says, \u201cis that it is rarely getting first-hand information. In India \u2013 and elsewhere \u2013 we have seen that social media can run in parallel and [amplify] compromised mainstream media. For this reason, the political opposition in India is going for a lot of mass contact. Rahul Gandhi [the former president of the Indian National Congress party], for example, is constantly on the road. Rallies, meetings, travelling by bus, by car, on foot. I cannot give a deadline that next year\u2019s election, 2024, will mark the sunrise of new democracy. But I can see that the force of those who believe in democracy is multiplying at a fast rate.\u201d\n\nHow, I wonder, before he finishes our call, is that colonial son Orwell viewed these days in his home town? \u201cThere is a museum to him,\u201d Kumar says. \u201cBut most people are not very aware. It\u2019s funny, over the years, I started talking about Nineteen Eighty-Four in my various programmes. Recently, the book has been translated into Hindi, along with Animal Farm.

In June the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the country\u2019s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy group, declared a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d for LGBTQ+ people in the US, citing \u201can unprecedented and dangerous spike in anti-LGBTQ+ legislative assaults sweeping state houses this year\u201d.\n\nAn HRC report this month found that 75 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were signed into law in the first five months of 2023 \u2013 more than double the entire amount passed in 2022.\n\n\u201cAlliance Defending Freedom is a recognized anti-LGBTQ hate group working to build a movement of far-right legal groups to force a dangerous, unpopular agenda on Americans,\u201d said Kyle Herrig, president of Accountable.US, a progressive organization which researches the finances and activities of special interest groups.\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom\u2019s goal is to strip Americans of their rights and undermine democracy Kyle Herrig of Accountable.US\n\n\u201cFrom ADF\u2019s involvement with a supreme court case contesting critical LGBTQ rights to the hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding ADF has granted to anti-democratic organizations, ADF\u2019s goal is to strip Americans of their rights and undermine democracy.\u201d\n\nThe ADF\u2019s most high-profile current case is the lawsuit 303 Creative, Inc v Elenis, which the supreme court decided on Friday.\n\nThe plaintiff, 303 Creative, is a website design company. 303 Creative has never made wedding websites, but its owner, Lorie Smith, claimed her first amendment rights were infringed because, if she were to start making wedding websites, she would not want to make them for same-sex couples \u2013 which would violate Colorado\u2019s anti-discrimination laws. The court found in 303\u2019s favor.\n\nThe ADF\u2019s rightwing advocacy extends further, however, as the organization has donated to more than a dozen anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-abortion groups.\n\nAccountable.US found that the ADF donated $85,000 to the Child and Parental Rights Campaign, a group which, according to a Politico report, helped Florida Republicans shape the state\u2019s so-called \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d law, which prohibits discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools.\n\nThe group has also sued two school districts in Florida over issues relating to the rights of trans youth. One case saw the Child and Parental Rights Campaign sue the Leon county school district, complaining that teachers had allowed a child to choose their preferred pronouns. The case was dismissed by a judge in January.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Liberation Front (WLF), a group which previously campaigned against the Obama administration providing protections for transgender students in schools, received $50,000 from the ADF the same year.\n\nA self-described \u201cradical feminist\u201d organization, the WLF has been called an \u201canti-trans hate group\u201d by Glaad, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, and appears to have developed a specific focus on restricting trans children\u2019s access to sports.\n\nThe WLF has partnered with rightwing organizations as it has attempted, and sometimes succeeded, to restrict trans people\u2019s rights in the US. Members of the group have testified in support of legislation which restricts transgender treatments for youth in South Dakota, and have criticized Biden\u2019s executive orders on gender identity.\n\nAnother beneficiary of the ADF\u2019s largesse was the Kriegshauser Ney Law Group, which in 2022 brought a lawsuit, with the ADF, on behalf of a Kansas teacher who refused to use transgender or non-binary students\u2019 preferred pronouns. The Geary county school district settled with the teacher for $95,000.\n\nThe Ethics and Public Policy Center, which filed an amicus brief supporting the ADF in the 303 Creative case, received $78,000. Leonard Leo, an influential rightwing activist who helped Donald Trump select three supreme court justices, serves as a director for the group, which has also supported a case which challenges FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Thing Free daily newsletter Start the day with the top stories from the US, plus the day\u2019s must-reads from across the Guardian Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over 220 bills which \u201cspecifically target transgender and non-binary people\u201d were introduced in the first four and a half months of 2023, the Human Rights Campaign found, with Florida, North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas showing a particular relish for legislation which would affect trans rights.\n\nAt the national level, trans people are also under attack from the right. As the Republican presidential primary gears up, opposition to LGBTQ rights \u2013 and trans rights in particular \u2013 has become something of a litmus test for candidates, as they seek to win over a far-right GOP base.\n\n\u201cAlliance Defending Freedom is among the largest and most effective legal advocacy organizations dedicated to protecting the religious freedom and free speech rights of all Americans. Our record includes 14 supreme court victories since 2011 and over 400 victories protecting the free speech rights of students on college campuses,\u201d said Jeremy Tedesco, senior vice-president of corporate engagement at the ADF.\n\nJustin Unga, vice-president of strategic initiatives at the Human Rights Campaign, described the ADF as \u201cone of the most dangerous elements in the anti-LGBTQ+ cause\u201d, but said the group\u2019s influence would not last forever.\n\nIn 2022, the Pew Research Center found that only 64% of Americans identified as Christian, down from 90% 50 years prior, and predicted that the number of Christians in the US would fall below 50% in the next 40 years.\n\nThe number of Americans who identify as LGBTQ+, meanwhile, is \u201csurging dramatically, and will be an impact in future elections\u201d, Unga said.\n\n\u201c[Groups like the ADF] will burn bright for a time like this, but when public opinion catches up, when demography catches up, we will see them fizzle out,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the meantime, Unga said the Human Rights Campaign and other groups are engaged in efforts to highlight politicians\u2019 record on LGBTQ+ rights, and to turn out the vote in key areas.\n\n\u201cAll elected officials are still beholden to their constituents and the people they serve, the people who elect them,\u201d Unga said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified over 60 million what we call \u2018equality voters\u2019: voters who are motivated by issues of equality. They are people who pay attention to whether or not the candidate or elected official votes to advance protections for LGBTQ+ folks or votes to oppose them.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe will turn our voters out in support of our candidates and we intend to do that at every level of government from state legislatures to the White House.\u201d", "tiktoken_token_count": 1866, "llama_token_count": 2298}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Suzanne Wrack", "title": "Women\u2019s World Cup really is set to be the best ever, despite the obstacles | Suzanne Wrack", "description": "The buildup has been blighted by player disquiet and an ACL injury epidemic but the tournament should continue to reach new levels on the pitch\u201cThis is going to be the biggest and best ever Women\u2019s World Cup.\u201d There is no need to attribute the quote because i\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jul/19/womens-world-cup-set-to-be-best-ever-despite-obstacles", "text": "\u201cThis is going to be the biggest and best ever Women\u2019s World Cup.\u201d There is no need to attribute the quote because it has come out of the mouth of almost every Fifa official, coach, player and pundit as the clock has ticked down and tournament fever has ramped up. What\u2019s more: it is true.\n\nThis will very literally be the biggest Women\u2019s World Cup in history with the competition expanded from 24 to 32 teams. Eight of the countries in Australia and New Zealand will be making their World Cup debuts. And, with Fifa targeting a global audience of two billion and one and a half million through the gates, it is likely to be the biggest in that respect too. That it will be the best is somewhat inevitable as well, the consequence of a rapidly developing game where each improvement naturally leads to a better product on the pitch.\n\nHowever, with rapid growth comes uneven development. Scratch the surface of the hyperbole around the tournament, which kicks off on Thursday when co-hosts New Zealand and Australia take on Norway and the Republic of Ireland respectively, and there is still a long way to go to ensure that players and teams can reach their full potential and put on the best show possible.\n\n01:25 Three issues women's national teams are still facing before World Cup \u2013 video\n\nThe open letter sent by leading Jamaica players, including the superstar forward Khadija \u201cBunny\u201d Shaw, to the Jamaican Football Federation expressing their disappointment at the level of support for the team going into its second World Cup is damning. Subpar \u201cplanning, transportation, accommodations, training conditions, compensation, communication, nutrition, and accessibility to proper resources\u201d have all been highlighted, while the players also said that they had missed friendly matches because of \u201cextreme disorganisation\u201d.\n\nCanada\u2019s players threatened strike action in February over pay equity issues and budget cuts with the Canada Soccer interim general secretary, Jason de Vos, saying last month that the federation was in a \u201creal struggle\u201d and having to consider bankruptcy protection.\n\nHome hero Sam Kerr (centre) will hope to lead Australia deep into the tournament. Photograph: Albert Perez/Getty Images\n\nIn addition, 12 of the 15 players who declared themselves unavailable for selection for Spain last year because of the impact of the team environment on their health and emotional state remain exiled from the squad. Barcelona\u2019s Champions League winners Mapi Le\u00f3n, Patri Guijarro and Sandra Pa\u00f1os are not travelling to the World Cup.\n\nThen there is the long list of players unavailable for the tournament because of injury, with many having suffered anterior cruciate ligament injuries. For England, there is no Euro 2022 Golden Boot-winning forward Beth Mead, captain Leah Williamson or Fran Kirby. The reigning champions, the United States, are without their captain, Becky Sauerbrunn, influential midfielder Sam Mewis and forwards Mallory Swanson, Christen Press and Catarina Macario. Canada are without key forward Janine Beckie. France are missing Delphine Cascarino and Marie-Antoinette Katoto. New Zealand\u2019s Katie Rood will miss her home tournament.\n\nThe list of names goes on and on and while ACL injuries are not preventable, there is consensus that more needs to be done to improve research around the multifaceted causes of the injury and find ways to reduce the risks associated with them.\n\nIn the run up to this World Cup issues over the release of players for national team duty highlighted inadequacies in Fifa\u2019s match calendar and left players in limbo while fraught negotiations took place. The dispute between Fifa and broadcasters in Europe\u2019s five biggest footballing markets over the value of rights for the tournament also cast a shadow.\n\nThe list of the hurdles in front of teams and players is lengthy and varied and until those hurdles are removed from the track, we won\u2019t see the exciting sprint that the World Cup is supposed to be. Hopefully that will come in future tournaments.\n\nAlexia Putellas is back in the Spain fold but several of her Barcelona teammates are absent. Photograph: Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images\n\nThat backdrop of struggles makes the sense this will be the best World Cup ever all the more extraordinary. Players continue to improve and make the most of the positive aspects of increasing professionalism. This time they will be rewarded individually for their efforts too, with Fifa paying participation fees directly to players for the first time. Those in the group stage will receive $30,000 (\u00a324,000) and players on the winning team will walk away with $270,000 (\u00a3217,000) each.\n\nWhen the first ball is kicked in Auckland none of the buildup, whether positive or negative, will be forgotten. Instead, the football will reflect the progress made and the obstacles remaining.

Seven of the eight quarter-finalists were European but there was only ever going to be one winner. This time, the destination of the trophy is less obvious. A whole host of teams have a serious chance to deny the US, a team that are always potent but who are in transition, a third successive crown.\n\nEngland may be without a number of stars, but they have one of the best managers in the world in Sarina Wiegman and capable backup players. The Euro 2022 runners-up, Germany, have most of their players fit and a strong year behind them. Spain have performed exceptionally, even without some of their biggest names in the mix.\n\nFrance finally have some stability with their new manager, Herv\u00e9 Renard, in post. Sweden reached the semi-finals in 2019 and were runners-up at the Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nThe tumult in the France camp during the buildup appears to have eased. Photograph: Melanie Laurent/DPPI/Shutterstock\n\nAustralia are the dark horses. The prospect of watching Sam Kerr on the world stage on home soil is spine-tingling. She is a big-game player but she also has a host of talent around her. With a home crowd behind them and the never-say-die Kerr spearheading the attack, Australia could have their own World Cup 1999 or Euro 2022 moment.\n\nExpect players to challenge the status quo too. In 2019 it was Megan Rapinoe duelling with then president of the United States, Donald Trump, championing LGBTQ+ rights and the US team leading the call for equal pay.\n\nLast year, players challenged the decision that left their male counterparts unable to wear the \u201cone love\u201d armband in Qatar and spoke out against human rights abuses and lack of rights for women in the country. At the Euros, England players challenged the government to commit to equal access to football in schools. There will be no shying away from the big issues \u2013 players will maximise their opportunity to fight for change while in the global spotlight.\n\nOn and off the pitch, this should be a World Cup to remember.

He looks across the table to his daughter, who has been brought along for today\u2019s interview. \u201cDo you remember this?\u201d She looks up from her iPad and smiles. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten that the tailor\u2019s trick is to appeal to ego and status worship,\u201d says McKenzie. This was 2021, and cryptocurrency was everywhere in the US at the time. This encrypted, decentralised digital currency, as the TV ads, social media accounts and celebrity endorsements told everyone, was the way to get rich, and promised to be the future of money. Get in now, was the message, before it was too late.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t avoid seeing parallels with the bedtime story \u2013 that it relied on people buying into an idea that, he suspected, may prove to be a mirage. Getting to the part when it was a child who calls out the truth of the emperor\u2019s \u201cclothes\u201d, he had a thought: maybe I\u2019m that child. \u201cI mean, what do I know?\u201d he says now, with a laugh. McKenzie is an actor, a former teen heart-throb known for his role in the mid-2000s drama The OC and who recently starred in the superhero crime TV series Gotham. Even with his 20-plus-year-old economics degree, he seemed an unlikely anti-crypto crusader. \u201cBut when in life do you have a chance to have an adventure?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat did I have to lose?\u201d\n\nWe meet in a studio in London; the whole family are in the UK, where McKenzie\u2019s wife, the actor Morena Baccarin, is shooting the third Deadpool film. Spare a thought for his daughter, seven and delightful, who is with her dad today and patiently waiting for him to finish (he has two children, plus a stepson from Baccarin\u2019s first marriage). McKenzie is about to publish a book, Easy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud, which he has written with the journalist Jacob Silverman. It\u2019s an entertaining caper, spiked with barely concealed fury at the people complicit in crypto\u2019s rise to become an almost \u00a33tn industry at its peak in 2021 \u2013 the CEOs, politicians and celebrities who took advertising money \u2013 and its collapse, which picked up speed in 2022 and swallowed many ordinary people\u2019s savings. \u201cUnfortunately, poorer folks disproportionately got in later,\u201d he says, of those who bought during the boom.\n\nWhat makes me most angry is the selling of this junk to people who cannot afford to lose the real money they have\n\nMcKenzie is the accidental investigative journalist in what he calls his \u201cbizarre career pivot\u201d, occasionally deploying his self-deprecatingly described \u201cmid-level celebrity\u201d to such missions as getting into a social media company-sponsored party \u2013 the same night a CIA operative comically tries to recruit the co-authors \u2013 or smoothing the path to an interview with the crypto exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried, through his OC-fan assistant. The book introduces us to a highly dubious but entertaining cast, including eccentric CEOs such as Alex Mashinsky (months after they met, his lending platform Celsius declared bankruptcy and he was accused of securities fraud in a civil lawsuit, which he denies) and Justin Sun who, on taking citizenship of Grenada \u2013 Caribbean tax havens being strangely attractive to crypto moguls \u2013 was given a diplomatic role, and still refers to himself as \u201cHis Excellency\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a thoroughly researched trip through crypto\u2019s often impenetrable world and many of the elements that came together to fuel it: the 2008 financial crisis and the mistrust in traditional finance; the rise of social media, influencers and misinformation; rampant libertarianism; the legions of predominantly younger men groomed by years of online poker and sports gambling; the rise of Trump and everything he wreaked. \u201cWhen a conman is elected president of the country that symbolises capitalism globally,\u201d says McKenzie, \u201cthat is a problem.\u201d\n\nSimpler times \u2026 McKenzie (right) with Rachel Bilson, Adam Brody and Mischa Barton on The OC. Photograph: Warner Bros Tv/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nMcKenzie\u2019s interest started during the early days of the pandemic. TV production had shut down and in the midst of \u201cboredom and a midlife crisis\u201d, he says with a laugh, he became curious. He considered buying crypto but the more he read, about bubbles and economic history, the more suspicious he became: \u201cBubbles go parabolic up right at the end, and then parabolic down, usually. That\u2019s where I felt we were, like this was not sustainable. But in times of mania, it\u2019s herd mentality and everyone just piles on.\u201d It was, he thought, \u201cpotentially a massive Ponzi scheme. I hadn\u2019t quite decided that, but I knew it was a bubble.\u201d\n\nMcKenzie hadn\u2019t been aware he\u2019d been looking for a project, but suddenly here one was. He hoped that with his profile and rediscovered interest in economics he might make people question the boom. He contacted Silverman, a New Republic journalist whose piece headlined Even Donald Trump Knows Bitcoin Is a Scam he had enjoyed, and they met for a drink.\n\nMcKenzie suggested they collaborate on a book. \u201cIt felt like something I could do, because I know a little bit about money, but I know about lying \u2013 I do it for a living,\u201d he says. His career had taught him about hype, and bubbles \u2013 he\u2019d lived through his own. McKenzie had discovered acting at university. He had never planned to be an economist but was vaguely thinking about becoming a lawyer, like his father. Then he auditioned for university plays, loved it, and within a couple of years of graduating he had the lead role in The OC. The show became an instant hit. Being one of the most famous young actors in the world at the time \u201cwas a really fun experience, one I could never have imagined having, but a learning experience as well, let\u2019s say. You talk about the parabolic rise and fall.\u201d He laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re never the hottest thing for ever.\u201d\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Photograph: Jessica Miglio/AP\n\nThe similarities between the cryptocurrency industry and Hollywood? Ultimately, it comes down to marketing. \u201cIf crypto doesn\u2019t have a product, which I would argue it does not, then what are you buying when you\u2019re buying these bits of code? It\u2019s just a story.\u201d An appealing one, he adds. It claimed to be inclusive for people who, for various reasons, usually of inequality, didn\u2019t have traditional bank accounts. \u201cIt\u2019s going to build generational wealth, it\u2019s going to democratise and decentralise the future of money,\u201d he says. \u201cNone of it\u2019s true.\u201d He understands why people were drawn in. \u201cI almost was. It had, at least on paper, or screen, made money for a bunch of people. Even if at the end of the day it actually hadn\u2019t because they couldn\u2019t get the money out when the price crashed.\u201d\n\nThere are plenty of things one could be upset about right now. Why did he feel so strongly about cryptocurrency? \u201cBecause it\u2019s wrong!\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. If I was right \u2013 and this was two years ago \u2013 there were signs, historically.\u201d He and Silverman started writing articles. Their first, for Slate, criticised McKenzie\u2019s fellow celebrities, such as Kim Kardashian and NFL star Tom Brady, who had endorsed crypto companies. \u201cIt\u2019s just gross,\u201d says McKenzie. \u201cShowbiz is a hustle, and there is money to be made by selling products, which is fine, but this is different. This is not soap or car insurance. This is an unregulated, unlicensed security, in my opinion, and you are effectively offering financial advice, whether you say you are or not.\u201d (Kardashian was later fined $1.3m by the Securities and Exchange Commission; the \u201ctoken\u201d she was promoting is now virtually worthless.) One hilariously overblown ad fronted by Matt Damon likened crypto investing to the pinnacles of human achievement, such as mountaineering and space exploration. McKenzie laughs. \u201cNo, you\u2019re just a guy in a studio with a black T-shirt on, pointing at random [CGI] stuff that doesn\u2019t even exist. But you got paid a lot of money to do that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019ll be around as long as people believe in it.

He essentially bet $250,000 that the crypto market would collapse but got the timing wrong and lost most of it. Did that make him question his position? \u201cOh yeah. And it made me think about how to tell my wife, which is where a lot of crypto people [who have made big losses] have gotten.\u201d He smiles. \u201cIt was an expensive lesson. But it was a luxury that I had the money to speculate with. What makes me most angry is the selling of this junk to people who cannot afford to lose the real money they have, and the complicity of the people that did that.\u201d\n\nWith everyone seemingly in thrall to crypto during the boom, it felt isolating at first. \u201cAs soon as I met fellow sceptics, I was like: \u2018Ah, these are my people,\u2019 just a great group of nerds \u2013 cryptographers, computer scientists, economists, a lot of amateur sleuths.\u201d He didn\u2019t find much dissent in the media, which saddened him. \u201cThere was a lot of just putting out press releases, basically. I saw so much drivel.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried, founder of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange and at one point the world\u2019s youngest billionaire, was the subject of many breathless media profiles. McKenzie built up a relationship with him before meeting for an interview \u2013 this was months before his businesses spectacularly collapsed last year and he was arrested on criminal charges, including fraud and money laundering. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what we know now, but there were red flags,\u201d says McKenzie. On a personal level, McKenzie wasn\u2019t impressed with the young man routinely described as the next Warren Buffett or JP Morgan. His empire, McKenzie felt, was \u201cfar more rickety than I had even suspected. He\u2019s the guy? That\u2019s your JP Morgan?\u201d\n\nMcKenzie and Silverman spoke to politicians, and looked into the \u201crevolving door\u201d between politicos who then go to work for these companies, and the huge donations from crypto firms; Bankman-Fried\u2019s companies alone donated at least \u00a3100m between Democrats and Republicans. Did it surprise McKenzie, or is he cynical enough by now? \u201cI thought I was cynical,\u201d he says with a grim smile.\n\nWhat has this experience done for McKenzie? \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible adventure,\u201d he says. He has reported from El Salvador, which recognises bitcoin as legal tender, visited environmentally disastrous cryptocurrency mining facilities and, at the end of last year, he found himself testifying before the Senate banking committee. \u201cIt\u2019s given me a broader understanding of diversity of experiences. I\u2019ve formed genuine friendships.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t know what he will do next. He still believes crypto has no real-world use or value but he hasn\u2019t, I point out, successfully brought cryptocurrency down and he laughs. (For the crypto survivors, the market appears to be recovering even if the regulators are circling. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fair market, most of the volume is fake, there\u2019s very real liquidity, meaning the real money, backing it,\u201d counters McKenzie.) Crypto will be around, he says, \u201cas long as people believe in it. The brilliance of the con is it points out something we can all agree on \u2013 the financial system is unequal \u2013 and then pivot: \u2018crypto solves it\u2019.\u201d He smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s the trick \u2013 it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWe could continue to choose to ignore those flaws in traditional finance, but McKenzie doesn\u2019t think we should. \u201cWe made [the financial system] up, just like we made up money, so we can change it \u2013 but it does require work and it does require we speak the truth.\u201d\n\nEasy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud is published on 27 July by Abrams.", "tiktoken_token_count": 2830, "llama_token_count": 3381}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Victoria Amelina", "title": "Victoria Amelina: Ukraine and the meaning of home", "description": "Before she was killed by a Russian missile strike, the acclaimed novelist and war crimes researcher wrote about growing up in Moscow\u2019s shadow, and how she came to understand what being Ukrainian really meantVictoria Amelina, an award-winning novelist, essayis\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/06/victoria-amelina-novelist-kramatorsk-russia-ukraine-war-meaning-of-home", "text": "Victoria Amelina, an award-winning novelist, essayist and poet, died on 1 July from injuries sustained in a Russian missile attack on a restaurant in eastern Ukraine.

May her memory be an inspiration to Ukrainians and those who share her ideals.\n\nEmma Graham-Harrison, senior international affairs correspondent\n\n\u2018I was the worst investment the Russians ever made\u2019\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, many believed that all borders would disappear. I remember singing Wind of Change by the German band the Scorpions at an international summer camp near Pskov, then the Soviet Union, in 1990, and feeling like the lyrics truly spoke to me: \u201cThe world is closing in / and did you ever think / that we could be so close, like brothers?\u201d Were we all \u201cchildren of tomorrow\u201d, dreaming and believing in a better future? Where are we now?\n\nThe winds of change turned out to be nothing more than an illusion, and my belief in it only shows that, culturally and mentally, Ukraine has always been a part of the somewhat naive west. The difference is that the Ukrainians were destined to face the truth eventually. Some learned it from the stories of Ukrainian dissidents like the poet Vasyl Stus, who was murdered in a Russian penal colony five years before Wind of Change was released. Others, like me, had to experience the Russian world first-hand to realise that the border between Russia and Ukraine is not a redundancy or a formality, but essential for our survival.\n\nIt seems that we are all doomed to repeat our mistakes if we don\u2019t know where our home \u2013 the safe space of trust \u2013 ends, and which of its borders need to be especially well guarded.\n\nI was born in western Ukraine in 1986, the year the Chornobyl nuclear reactor exploded and the Soviet Union began to crumble. Despite my birthplace and the timing of my birth, I was educated to be Russian. There was an entire system in place that aimed to make me believe that Moscow, not Kyiv, was the centre of my universe. I attended a Russian school, performed in a school theatre named after the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin and prayed in the Russian Orthodox church. I even enjoyed a summer camp for teenagers in Russia, and attended youth gatherings at the Russian cultural centre in Lviv, where we sang so-called Russian rock music, which was actually more honest about the changes happening in Russia than the naive compositions of the Scorpions.\n\nVictoria Amelina\n\nWhen I was 15, I won a local competition and was chosen to represent my home town, Lviv, at an international Russian language contest in Moscow. I was excited to visit the Russian capital. Moscow felt like the centre of what I considered home. My library was full of Russian classics, and even though the Soviet Union had collapsed almost a decade earlier, not much had changed in the Russian school I attended, or on Russian TV, which my family had the habit of watching. Additionally, while I didn\u2019t even have the money to travel around Ukraine, Russia was happy to invest in my Russianisation.\n\nAt the contest in Moscow I met kids from all those countries Russia would later try to invade or assimilate: Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova. The Russian Federation invested a lot of money in raising children like us from the \u201cformer Soviet republics\u201d as Russians. They probably invested more in us than they did in the education of children in rural Russia: those who were already conquered didn\u2019t need to be tempted with summer camps and excursions to Red Square.\n\nHopefully, I will have turned out to be one of the worst investments the Russian Federation ever made.\n\nIn Moscow, a famous journalist from ORT, a top Russian TV channel at the time, approached me for an interview on the evening news. I was flattered, I felt like a star. The journalist started with a polite question about how I was enjoying the event and the Russian capital, but quickly moved on to her real agenda. \u201cHow oppressed do you feel as a Russian speaker in the west of Ukraine? How dangerous is it to speak Russian on the streets of your home town, Lviv?\u201d\n\nI gasped as I realised that I wasn\u2019t a star at all; I was just being used to manipulate millions of viewers of the evening news. The huge camera was watching me and a big, professional microphone was in front of me for the first time in my life. I was only 15 years old. But in that split second, I had to figure out where the borders of my home were. I wasn\u2019t Russian, after all \u2013 I was a Ukrainian kid brought to Moscow to reinforce certain Russian narratives. I may have believed that Russia was a great country with peace at its core, but I only felt that way because of watching the very channel that was now trying to exploit an inexperienced 15-year-old.\n\n\u201cAfter our complex history, it would only be natural for Ukrainians to feel uncomfortable and react at times to the Russian language,\u201d I replied. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t experience any oppression. Maybe your information is outdated? I am young, and there\u2019s no such problem among the younger generation.\u201d\n\nThe journalist tried to ask me again, but my responses weren\u2019t going to change. She had already failed. I doubt they aired this interview on the evening news. Or perhaps they managed to edit it in a way that suited their agenda. Now, as a Ukrainian writer, I receive requests for interviews from various Russian channels, but I decline them all. My Moscow experience was quite enough.\n\nA local resident walks among the remains of the restaurant destroyed by a Russian missile strike on Kramatorsk on 27 June. Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nI remembered this story in 2022, watching an interview with an elderly man in Mariupol. He was desperate, disoriented and disarmingly honest. \u201cBut I believed in this Russian world, can you imagine? All my life I believed we were brothers!\u201d the poor man exclaimed, surrounded by the ruins of his beloved city. The man\u2019s apartment building was in ruins and the illusion of home, the space he perceived as his motherland, the former Soviet Union where he was born and lived his best years, had been crushed even more brutally. The propaganda stopped working on him only when the Russian bombs fell. The border between independent Ukraine and the Russian Federation arose in his mind as a crucial barrier, just like it did in mine when I realised I had only been brought to festive Moscow to lie about my home town in Ukraine, so that the Russian viewers could hate it even more.\n\nI think most people would now agree that a wall between us and Russia is a good solution until Russian society undergoes significant changes. A world where every neighbour is a friend is a nice idea to sing about, but where Russia is concerned, it is unfortunately not so realistic.\n\nIt is tempting to believe in the simple, inspiring concept of welcoming everyone as a friend and brother. But does this approach actually work? In a very different winter in 2019, I saw another collision between the imaginary idyll, where borders can be crossed in search of miracles, and a harsher reality. As my family and I prepared to celebrate Christmas in Boston, Massachusetts, I found myself standing among a forest of trees, promising my son that we would choose the best one. Despite my lack of experience in choosing Christmas trees (in Ukraine, we had always used an old, artificial, but reusable one), I regretted not looking up some advice beforehand.\n\nI needed to ask the seller for help selecting a tree, but he seemed too busy with other customers and clearly needed to sell all the trees, even the poor quality ones. However, I knew what would get him to pay attention to us. I simply mentioned that this would be our first Christmas in the United States, which was true. And the \u201cWelcome to America\u201d magic began. The man immediately made us his priority and helped us find the perfect tree. He seemed to be one of those true Americans who believe that welcoming newcomers is at the core of American values.\n\nI knew of course that this value was shared by many in the US, but not everyone. After all, it was the time when Donald Trump was president. As I walked the streets of Cambridge, I always stopped to look at a picture of a child that had been attached to a church fence \u2013 one of those children who had been separated from their parents and detained at the border, and had not survived. The only crime of the little girl in the picture was crossing the border from Mexico into the US with her parents, who were only trying to give her a better life.\n\nThe Christmas tree seller was just as angry about the family separation policy in the US as I was. But Trump supporters had different ideas about what the country was and how its borders should be protected. It was incomprehensible to me why it was so difficult for Mexican migrants to cross into the US in 2019, yet so easy for Russian soldiers to cross the border into Ukraine in 2022.\n\nOne thing remains indisputable: humanity constantly messes up with borders. Much like adolescents unsure about their identity, we let the wrong people in and keep the right ones out. We pay too much attention to appearances, including not only the colour of our skin, but the colour of our passports; instead we could pay more attention to core values like freedom, dignity and the rule of law, which we either do or do not share. Yet some of us are easily tricked by strangers, like I was when I admired Russia as a kid, or we are too scared of them, like Americans clamouring for a wall to keep Mexicans out. Why are we so wrong in choosing who to trust? Perhaps it\u2019s because we don\u2019t know how to trust each other in our own countries.\n\nAs a writer, I tend to think of home as the narrative shared by its inhabitants. People and places come about in stories: poets, playwrights, ancient prophets and novelists have all imagined the countries and cities we live in now, and their stories have greatly affected us and our relations with one another. But what story do we all fit into? My answer is complicated and straightforward: the only story we all can fit into is a true one.\n\nThe National Museum of the Holodomor-Genocide in Kyiv. Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty Images\n\nThe true history of Ukraine is complex, painful and dramatic. For a long time, no book reflected my family\u2019s experience or explained why I didn\u2019t inherit the Ukrainian language from my grandparents. Their decision to protect their kids (my parents) by raising them to speak Russian was inexplicable to me as a child. Growing up speaking Russian made me feel out of place. So eventually, I had to write a novel about families like mine. My home town Lviv was in the heart of the \u201cBloodlands\u201d, as the historian Timothy Snyder calls the lands from the Baltic to the Black Sea. I had to discover that the Soviet army killed thousands of Ukrainians early on in the second world war. And that around 100,000 Jewish citizens of Lviv perished in the same period.\n\nMy family lived through the trauma of the Holodomor, also called the Great Famine, which took place from 1932-33, but my grandparents never talked in detail about it. Silence creates cracks so deep that it is hardly possible to feel at home. When stories about the Holocaust or Holodomor are not fully revealed, we\u2019re bound not to trust each other. Who were you in 1933? The hungry one or the one taking all the food? The one who shot Ukrainian activists in 1941, or the one who searched for their loved one among the decomposing bodies? The scared one watching from the window when Jews were taken away or the one who took them? The one who wrote to the KGB about your neighbour or the one who helped Ukrainian dissidents? There were silences instead of the much-needed stories. And where there\u2019s a lack of true stories, there is a lack of trust. We are bound to believe the propaganda and draw all the wrong borders again and again, never feeling completely at home.\n\nIn Ukraine, everything changed in the first days of December 2013, at the beginning of the Revolution of Dignity, when protesters took to the streets after President Yanukovych rejected closer ties with Europe in favour of Moscow. After the police severely beat students on Independence Square in Kyiv, it became clear that this was a time to prevent Ukraine from turning into an authoritarian state like Russia or Belarus. Everyone who felt like a free Ukrainian had to take the risk of heading to the Maidan. But what if others didn\u2019t have the courage to join the demonstration? Then the few brave ones would be powerless against police violence. To take to the streets of Kyiv, we had to take the risk of trusting each other.\n\nEventually, up to half a million people showed up. That\u2019s when we knew we could count on each other. Ukraine finally felt like home to me, too. Home isn\u2019t a magical, perfect place, but a place where, if you are being beaten by the police, you can be sure that your neighbours will show up to take a stand for you.\n\nPeople gathered at the Maidan in Kyiv in February 2014. Photograph: Fabrice Elsner/SIPA/REX\n\nThe old silences didn\u2019t disappear miraculously, but after 2013 we trusted each other enough to build platforms and institutions that deal with our traumatic past as well. And after the Revolution of Dignity, there was a new true story, in which the question \u201cWho are you?\u201d was being answered by everyone every day in 2014. There was war at our doors, fighting continued in the Donbas region, but our vision was as clear as ever.\n\nIn the spring and summer of 2014, I was sure a full-scale Russian invasion had already begun, and that the brutality would intensify and gradually spread throughout Ukraine. I packed my three-year-old son\u2019s belongings into an emergency backpack so we would be ready to hide in a bomb shelter at any moment. At that time, the bombs didn\u2019t fall on us; Russia annexed Crimea and ruined the lives of Ukrainians in Donetsk and Luhansk, but didn\u2019t go further in full force. The world didn\u2019t react. So the borders of my home were clear: they were Ukraine\u2019s borders. No one had our backs but us.\n\nWe had each other, and that was invaluable. But what about the beautiful vision? If we couldn\u2019t yet achieve the perfect world where we all supported one another, what about our cosy continent, Europe? Those years of the initial Russian invasion, 2014-2015, were a time when many Ukrainians felt betrayed not only by Russia, but also by the west, for not coming to our aid. We were Europeans under attack, but it was mainly our problem.\n\nIn November 1956, the director of the Hungarian news agency sent a message via telex to the world, shortly before Russian artillery wrecked his office. It read: \u201cWe are going to die for Hungary and for Europe.\u201d\n\nThe Czech writer Milan Kundera started his 1984 essay The Tragedy of Central Europe with this message. As one of the leading figures of the 1968 Prague Spring, Kundera understood what the brave Hungarian had meant by dying for Europe. As a Ukrainian writer in Kyiv in 2022, I can\u2019t stop thinking about Kundera, writing in exile after the Prague Spring failed. We, Central Europeans, are ready to fight for Europe, even if at times our love may be unrequited.\n\nEurope didn\u2019t come to Hungary\u2019s rescue. Nor did it come to the Czechs\u2019 rescue, or the Ukrainians\u2019 in 2014. If being a Central European means being betrayed by Europe, Ukraine is certainly a member of the club.\n\nHowever, when Russia started the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Europe did take in fleeing Ukrainians and accepted us unconditionally.\n\nI was out of the country at the time of the invasion. My flight from Egypt back to Ukraine was scheduled for 7am on 24 February 2022. The flight got cancelled, of course; Russia was bombing Ukrainian airports from Kyiv to Ivano-Frankivsk. \u201cDo you know what happened?\u201d the Egyptian official asked me as soon as we entered the terminal. I didn\u2019t reply for a moment, so he kept repeating as if allowing me time to take it in: \u201cYou cannot go to your country.\u201d\n\nWe stood for a long time amid a desperate crowd of Ukrainians, but eventually we were the only ones left in the tiny airport. The rest of the Ukrainians had left the building, heading to buses laid on by their tour agency.\n\nThat day, I bought overpriced tickets from Egypt to Prague, where Milan Kundera had fought for his home and Europe in 1968. At Hurghada airport, citizens of the European Union checked in casually and headed to the security control area; all Ukrainian citizens were asked to wait on one side. We tried to explain that Ukrainians had been able to travel to the European Union without visas for several years. But the airline workers replied that that didn\u2019t matter now: Prague had to tell the Egyptian side whether they were ready to let us into the country.\n\n\u201cAnd what if they won\u2019t let us in?\u201d my 10-year-old son asked me quietly.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to answer and just squeezed my son\u2019s hand.\n\nOther Ukrainians and I waited for the decision from Prague for about an hour, discussing rumours about a Ukrainian man who wasn\u2019t allowed to board his flight to Germany earlier in the day. Then the verdict was announced to us: \u201cYou can go.\u201d\n\nPeople fleeing the war in Ukraine cross the border into Poland in March 2022. Photograph: Omar Marques/Getty Images\n\nEven when we got to Prague airport, I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen. The Czech border officer glanced at our passports and then looked at us. She was more interested in the expressions on our faces than in our passport details: maybe she was new at the job and hadn\u2019t yet seen people whose country was being bombarded by the Russian Federation. I think she was looking at us with compassion. Then she just stamped our passports without asking any questions. And I realised that she knew; the whole world was looking at us. I started crying and couldn\u2019t stop, and when my son asked why I was crying, I replied:\n\n\u201cBecause we are home.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is not Ukraine,\u201d he argued.\n\n\u201cThis is Europe,\u201d I answered, as if this word \u201cEurope\u201d should explain everything to my child.\n\nWe were falling, and our fellow Europeans were ready to catch us. The limits of home may have just expanded, I thought.\n\nA bit later, I learned that train tickets in the Czech Republic and in Poland were free for Ukrainian citizens who had just fled their homeland. I travelled by train from Prague to Poland, and on the third day of the invasion, finally crossed the border back into Ukraine.\n\nAt the Polish-Ukrainian border, I witnessed indescribable desperation and fear. Little kids were pulling heavy suitcases, their frightened grandmas and mothers looking even more disoriented than them. I heard screams in the crowd as people were squeezed in the crush, and the loud voice of the border guard trying to get the refugees\u2019 attention and prevent a tragedy. Yet all these people were going to be accepted and even welcomed into the EU. They might not have known it at the time \u2013 cold, hungry, and fearful at the border \u2013 but at that very moment the boundaries of their home, Europe, were being expanded to include Ukraine.\n\nEurope was home, and it proved to be a space where we could count on each other, as Ukrainians counted on each other at the Maidan in 2014.\n\nWe Ukrainians are well aware of the discussions surrounding Europe\u2019s acceptance of Ukrainian refugees. While I share the concerns about racism and Islamophobia, I believe that what happened to Ukrainian refugees was more than just an act of kindness. It was a change in perspective, a change in the story of Europe, and ultimately a change in the borders of what Ukrainians and other Europeans consider their shared home. Ukrainians are now fighting not just for Ukraine, but for Europe as well.\n\nThis may not be much help to refugees from Syria or Sudan, unfortunately. But I believe that acts of kindness towards one group of refugees can teach us all, including Ukrainians, to be more kind to all other people fleeing wars. We can sing about a utopian brotherhood, or we can work diligently to expand the limits of the fragile shared trust we have. Despite all the obstacles, I still believe that the dream of a world without borders should be our inspiration. We may never fully realise this vision, but it can turn into a strategy that changes reality for the better.\n\nNo one is obliged to take in a stranger or show them love, yet it happens. This love becomes a true story that changes all future stories, including those of refugees.\n\nIn June 2022, I arrived in Brussels and took a bus from the airport to the city. I was headed to a meeting at the European parliament to discuss accountability for Russian war crimes. The bus was full of men in suits, all clearly headed to European institutions as well. However, I was perhaps the only one who noticed the irony of the song that opened the bus playlist: \u201cI follow the Moskva, down to Gorky Park \u2026\u201d the Scorpions frontman sang. The bureaucrats in their expensive suits kept typing on their laptops, paying no attention to the song and the story it conveyed. I knew I didn\u2019t fit into this story. But I knew that we came to Brussels to write a new narrative for everyone, not to change some lousy playlist on an airport shuttle.\n\nThis piece is adapted from an essay first published as part of the International Writing Program\u2019s Home/Land/s symposium", "tiktoken_token_count": 4703, "llama_token_count": 5407}, {"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Helen Livingstone", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war live: traffic stopped on Crimean bridge due to \u2018emergency\u2019, governor says, as explosions reported", "description": "Russia-installed governor Sergei Aksyonov says \u2018measures\u2019 are being taken to restore \u2018situation\u2019 at bridge, which is a vital logistical link for Russian military<ul><li>Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 509 of the invasion</li></ul>Hello and\u2026", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/17/russia-ukraine-war-live-crimean-bridge-emergency-traffic-stops-explosion", "text": "From 17 Jul 2023 13.31 EDT Putin says Russia preparing response to Crimea bridge attack The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Monday his defence ministry was preparing proposals for a response to the overnight attack that damaged the road bridge linking Crimea to southern Russia, for which he blamed Ukraine.

In a statement, he said: The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is deeply alarmed at Russia\u2019s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, putting the future of the grain exports from the region at risk \u2013 a decision which will be most painfully felt by the 349 million people around the world facing food insecurity today. People are facing the \u201cripple effects\u201d on food and energy prices since the start of the war, he said, as \u201cthe expiration of the deal risks holding global food security at ransom\u201d. Approximately 80% of east Africa\u2019s grain is imported from Russia and Ukraine. With over 50 million people across east Africa facing hunger at crisis levels (IPC 3+) and food prices up by nearly 40% this year. Any disruption to the global food supplies at a time of heightened need could have devastating consequences. The world\u2019s most vulnerable will face the harshest consequences of today\u2019s withdrawal. Without the grain deal in place, it is all the more urgent that the United Nations humanitarian response plans for countries at risk of famine are fully funded and that global efforts to prevent famine from taking hold are coordinated through a re-energised UN\u2019s high-level taskforce on preventing famine.\n\n\n\n17 Jul 2023 13.31 EDT Putin says Russia preparing response to Crimea bridge attack The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Monday his defence ministry was preparing proposals for a response to the overnight attack that damaged the road bridge linking Crimea to southern Russia, for which he blamed Ukraine. At the end of a televised meeting with national and regional officials to assess the consequences of the attack, Putin called it a cruel and senseless act, as he said the bridge had not been used for months to supply Russian forces fighting in Ukraine, Reuters reports.

She made the aid announcement, first reported by Reuters, at the state emergency services headquarters in the capital, Kyiv, to respond to the needs of Ukrainians affected by the war. (See 14:34) The aid, which will be provided through the UN and other non-governmental organisation partners, will increase support for those who have been displaced or otherwise affected by the war with emergency food assistance, health care and safe drinking water, among other assistance, according to a statement from the US agency for international development (USAID). Power said she handed over on Monday an additional $2.3m worth of equipment to help the agency repair the damage inflicted by Russia\u2019s forces on Ukraine\u2019s critical infrastructure. Power said: We see what is happening in Ukraine. Russia continues to burn and Ukraine continues to build. It is our privilege \u2026 to support our Ukrainian partners as they do that building. This is a reckless decision that will have profound human consequences, and it\u2019s just another example of Russian callousness and disregard for human lives and livelihoods, not only here in Ukraine but all around the world. Power also expressed \u201cgrave dismay\u201d with Russia\u2019s decision to suspend its participation in a pact that has allowed the Black Sea export of grain from Ukraine for the past year in a deal that aimed to alleviate a global food crisis by allowing Ukrainian grain blocked by the Russia-Ukraine conflict to be exported safely.\n\nUpdated at 12.46 EDT\n\n17 Jul 2023 11.43 EDT Belarus said it downed a Ukrainian drone on the border between the two countries, days after Minsk confirmed the arrival of Russian Wagner fighters on its territory.

The Belarusian border committee said: A border security unit on duty on the Dnipro River discovered a drone that had violated the state border from Ukrainian territory. The drone was used for the reconnaissance of the border area of the Republic of Belarus. It said the drone was intercepted in the Braginsky area in the south-eastern corner of Belarus, where the Dnipro River flows near the border between the two neighbours. Border guards had downed the drone into the water using electronic air defence systems, the committee said.\n\n", "tiktoken_token_count": 3253, "llama_token_count": 3980}, {"source_name": "Business Insider", "author": "insider@insider.com (John L.

Adam Schiff can rest easy following the release of his Senate campaign's most recent financials, which show the campaign is sitting on more money than any single presidential candidate.\n\nAccording to his campaign's most recent financial disclosure, it's currently got about $29,800,864 of cash on hand. That's just over $2 million more than the second-highest candidate or committee, the Democratic National Committee, reported having.\n\nSchiff's massive fundraising haul in comparison to the presidential candidates and party committees was first pointed out by Rob Byers, the research director of California Target Book.\n\nSchiff's campaign also has millions more cash on hand than any other presidential candidate. According to FEC records, the presidential campaign with the closest amount of cash on hand is that of former President Donald Trump, which reported having $22,516,391 of cash on hand (about $10 million more than his Republican rival Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis).\n\nSchiff's Senate campaign may directly have more cash on hand than that of Trump or DeSantis, however, they have the backing of two fundraising machines in the Save America PAC and the Never Back Down PAC, respectively.\n\nWhile neither PAC's fundraising totals and amount of cash on hand have been released by the Federal Elections Commission yet, the Never Back Down PAC told NBC News it raised a whopping $130 million in Q2 of 2023 alone.\n\nThe money that Schiff's Senate campaign is sitting on will become increasingly useful in the coming months as he runs a competitive campaign against Rep.

Erik Connolly, now has another shot to be on top.\n\nConnolly is representing Smartmatic in another lawsuit against Fox News, which is still ongoing.\n\nAfter Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, his legal team pushed false conspiracy theories alleging the election was stolen. Two of the then-president's lawyers, Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani, falsely claimed that election technology companies Dominion and Smartmatic were secretly in cahoots with each other and deployed their technology to flip votes from Trump to now-President Joe Biden.\n\nDominion and Smartmatic each brought defamation lawsuits against Fox News. Fox and other media organizations advanced the false theories by allowing Powell and Giuliani to speak freely on their networks, the companies have alleged.\n\nJust as a trial was set to begin in Delaware state court, in April, Fox agreed to settle Dominion's claims for the record-breaking sum.\n\nBut Smartmatic's lawsuit continues going forward, playing out in a New York state court. (Giuliani is also a defendant in the case; Smartmatic's case against Powell is moving forward in Washington, DC, for jurisdictional reasons.)\n\nExperts told Insider that the $787.5 million settlement is a strong benchmark for Smartmatic \u2014 and that Smartmatic will likely get more.\n\n\"When Fox settled the Dominion case, it knew, or reasonably should have known, that it would be establishing a precedent or a benchmark that Smartmatic would try to exceed in its case,\" Clay Calvert, a First Amendment expert and nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told Insider.\n\nA better benchmark might be a cool $1 billion, according to James Goodale, a former lawyer for the New York Times and experienced First Amendment litigator.\n\n\"I think the number will float around that, $1 billion, one way or another,\" he said.\n\nSmartmatic wants more than Dominion. Fox says it isn't worth that much.\n\nSmartmatic's lawsuit alleges $2.7 billion in damages. The company's technology played a role in just one county in the 2020 election. In a series of appendices filed to court, Smartmatic has shown that it arrived at the $2.7 billion figure by adding up its forecasted lost profits in different regions worldwide because of what it says are canceled contracts. While Dominion has a large footprint in the US, Smartmatic does more work across Africa and Europe, according to the filings.\n\n\"Smartmatic's original projections are now unachievable as a result of Defendants' disinformation campaign,\" lawyers for the company wrote in its lawsuit against Fox.\n\nFox is battling Smartmatic's lawsuit in court, calling it an assault on the First Amendment's protections for free speech.\n\n\"We will be ready to defend this case surrounding extremely newsworthy events when it goes to trial, likely in 2025,\" a Fox spokesperson told Insider. \"As a report prepared by our financial expert shows, Smartmatic's damages claims are implausible, disconnected from reality, and on its face intended to chill First Amendment freedoms.\"\n\nFox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch. Victoria Jones/PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nIn court filings and public statements, Fox has characterized Smartmatic's damages demand as ludicrous. It hired a corporate law expert who looked at Smartmatic's underlying finances and argues it isn't worth nearly as much as it says.\n\nAccording to Fox's filings, Smartmatic's revenue has been largely shrinking since 2012. The \"extravagant\" damages claim is \"divorced from reality\" because it was losing money, Fox argues.\n\n\"Smartmatic insists that these phantom losses are all attributable not to the nationwide (indeed, global) coverage of the President's allegations against it, but to a handful of segments on Fox News,\" Fox lawyers wrote in one filing. \"That claim does not pass the straight-face test.\"\n\nSmartmatic, for its part, maintains that it lost contracts around the world because of false conspiracy theories pushed through channels like Fox News. But the differences between Smartmatic and Dominion do make it harder to predict the outcome of their cases, Calvert said.\n\n\"It's not necessarily a rinse and repeat situation, because they're different businesses,\" Calvert said. \"But I think it does establish a template for a potential settlement in terms of the damages.\"\n\nThe Dominion settlement helps Smartmatic\n\nIn Dominion's lawsuit, the election technology company calculated it lost about $88 million in lost profits from canceled contracts. From there, it extrapolated that it suffered $921 million in what are called \"lost enterprise\" damages to its business overall. Dominion also asked for hundreds of more millions to cover lost projected future profits, as well as money to fund repair to its reputation and security for its employees who suffered harassment. (Fox, before the settlement, challenged those figures).\n\nThere are two ways to view the $787.5 million settlement figure as a benchmark for Smartmatic, experts say.\n\nOne is as a 15% discount from the overall $921 million enterprise damages claim. The other is about 900% of the amount the company said it lost in profits.\n\nBy either metric, Smartmatic would get more money.\n\nIts \"lost enterprise\" calculation for its elections technology business comes out to $2.4 billion, according to the calculations in its court filings. Profits, per Smartmatic, were $690 million over five years. Either way you slice it, using those baseline numbers brings you above the $787.5 million figure Fox paid to settle Dominion's lawsuit.\n\n\"They're different numbers, they're different companies, they have different markets,\" Calvert said. \"But as long as the methodology in estimating their damages is the same, and you end up getting this portion of that amount, then I'm sure Smartmatic is saying to itself, 'That's the same thing we're going to get, as long as we follow that formula.'\"\n\nA protest outside of Fox News's New York headquarters. Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nSmartmatic would also likely insist on getting more money than Dominion received because they claimed more damages in the first place, pointed out Gautam Hans, a professor at Cornell Law School's First Amendment Clinic. The only question, Hans said, is how much higher the number will be.\n\n\"They have a very strong incentive to keep their prices down, and they may also want to be at a level that's close \u2014 or at the very least, not too much higher than \u2014 what they paid Dominion,\" Hans said of Fox. \"So I think that the real question is the strength of the case and how long Fox is willing to draw this out.\"\n\nThe fact that Dominion and Fox settled their case makes it hard to predict where things will go. It's not uncommon for parties to settle a lawsuit after a trial, agreeing on damages to ward off years of appeals. In the case between Fox and Dominion, they settled after a jury was selected but before opening arguments.\n\n\"It's hard to extrapolate from the Dominion case in part because it never got litigated,\" Hans said.\n\nGoodale, an attorney at Debevoise & Plimpton, believes Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch will view $1 billion as the benchmark \u2014 and will try to ensure the settlement number is less than that.\n\n\"De minimus, if the two cases look alike, they're going to go for the same amount. If there's something worse in the second case, it's going to go for more,\" Goodale said. \"But I think people will be circling around that billion-dollar figure. And Murdoch won't want to pay a billion, because the headline for a billion is bad.\"\n\nFox may want to settle the lawsuit before it gets to the summary judgment phase \u2014 when each side asks a judge to rule in its favor before going to trial.\n\nDominion's summary judgment filings in its lawsuit against Fox News disclosed some of the most damaging revelations about its hosts and executives.\n\n\"I would probably price in a significant increase over what Fox paid Dominion,\" Hans said. \"Would you rather pay $1 billion now and get rid of your legal fees on this case? Or are you willing to pay $1,000,000,001 in a few months and then have to pay more legal fees and also look foolish because you drew this out?\"", "tiktoken_token_count": 1871, "llama_token_count": 2376}, {"source_name": "NPR", "author": "Tamara Keith", "title": "President Biden posts 'blockbuster' three-month fundraising total: $72 million", "description": "The Biden campaign's self-reported fundraising numbers dwarf second-quarter totals for Republicans Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis.", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2023/07/14/1187702969/biden-campaign-fundraising-dnc-fec-donors", "text": "President Biden posts 'blockbuster' three-month fundraising total: $72 million\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Makela/Getty Images Mark Makela/Getty Images\n\nPresident Biden is starting his reelection campaign with tens of millions of dollars in the bank, dwarfing second-quarter fundraising totals already announced by the campaigns of former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nAccording to an announcement from the campaign ahead of a Federal Elections Commission reporting deadline this weekend, the Biden-Harris campaign, Democratic National Committee and their joint fundraising committees combined to raise $72 million from April to the end of June. They have $77 million cash on hand.\n\nBecause Biden is the incumbent president and his campaign is fully integrated with the DNC, the combined fundraising total represents all the funds the reelect could draw upon.\n\nDespite higher donation limits this election cycle, these totals are actually lower than the numbers posted by former Presidents Barack Obama and Trump at a similar point in their campaigns. Trump and the Republican National Committee raised $105 million in the second quarter of 2019, while Obama and the DNC raised $86 million.\n\nA Biden campaign official pointed out Obama got into the race in early April in 2011, while Biden waited until late April, so on a per-day-of-campaign basis Biden raised slightly more. The official also argued that Biden isn't running against the Obama of 2011 or the Trump of 2019.\n\nFor Republican candidates in this cycle, there is a competitive primary, so Republican National Committee fundraising totals don't help them yet.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump campaign announced the former president and his affiliated political action committee had raised more than $35 million in the second quarter.\n\nDeSantis' campaign said he had brought in $20 million since launching his candidacy in late June. DeSantis' super PAC, Never Back Down, says it has raised $130 million since early March. While super PACs work in support of the candidate, they can't coordinate with them.\n\nIn an online message shared with small-dollar donors via email and text, Biden-Harris campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez touted Biden's advantage over the GOP field.\n\n\"While Republicans are burning through resources in a divisive primary focused on who can take the most extreme MAGA positions, we are significantly outraising every single one of them \u2014 because our team's strength is our grassroots supporters,\" Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez said.\n\nJoe Biden via YouTube\n\nMore details will be available this weekend when campaigns file detailed reports with the FEC. What they release in advance of that reporting deadline tends to accentuate the data points that the campaign wants people to focus on.\n\nIn the case of the Biden campaign, they point to donations coming from nearly 400,000 donors, with an average donation of $39. A lower average donation shows grassroots enthusiasm and not just the support of deep-pocketed mega-donors. At this point in 2011, the Obama reelect had donations from more than 550,000 individuals.\n\nThe Biden campaign says 30% of its donations this past quarter came from new donors, who didn't give Biden money in 2020.\n\n\"There's only one word: blockbuster,\" said Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Biden campaign co-chair, who knows a thing or two about blockbusters. He co-founded the movie studio DreamWorks and now leads WndrCo.\n\nKatzenberg hasn't hosted a fundraiser for Biden yet this election cycle, though he has attended several high-dollar fundraisers with the president in his role as campaign co-chair.\n\nAs the quarter was nearing its end, some donors expressed concern to journalists that Biden's fundraising numbers would be weak and that his events weren't well attended.

But on July 21, Cannon issued an order pushing the trial start date to May 20, 2024 \u2014 at the tail end of the Republican presidential primary process.\n\nTrump's legal team will likely continue working to get the trial pushed back until after the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump aide Walt Nauta has also been indicted in this case. He pleaded not guilty in early July to charges that he conspired with the former president to withhold classified documents.\n\nOn July 27, a grand jury in the Southern District of Florida charged Trump with a new count of willful retention of National Defense Information in the case, stemming from a top-secret presentation he waved at aides at his Bedminster, N.J., resort. A new defendant was also added to the indictment.\n\nThe Trump campaign responded to the new charges with a statement: \"This is nothing more than a continued desperate and flailing attempt by the Biden Crime Family and their Department of Justice to harass President Trump and those around him.\"\n\nThe Stormy Daniels hush money case\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP via Getty Images Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP via Getty Images\n\nNumber of charges: 34\n\nExpected trial date: March 25, 2024 in New York\n\nWith this case, Trump became the first former president in United States history to be criminally indicted. The grand jury voted to indict Trump in March on 34 felony counts of business record falsification.\n\nAllegations in this case go back to before Trump was elected president. They are tied to hush money payments made before the 2016 elections to the adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover up an alleged affair.\n\nDaniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, has said that she and Trump had an affair in 2006. Following the launch of Trump's campaign in 2016, Daniels offered to sell her story to gossip magazines. In October, National Enquirer executives friendly to Trump flagged this to Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen.\n\nCohen agreed to pay $130,000 to Daniels to keep her silent. Her attorney received this money less than two weeks before the election. Cohen was later reimbursed $420,000 after Trump was elected president \u2014 which Trump has admitted to doing to pay off Daniels.

That included obstruction of an official proceeding; conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to make a false statement; and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. by assisting, aiding or comforting those involved in an insurrection.\n\nThe committee, however, had no power over what the DOJ chose to do.\n\nBut a possible indictment from federal prosecutors could touch on attempts by Trump and his allies to pressure officials not to certify the 2020 election results or urging his supporters to \"fight like hell\" to stop Congress from certifying the result.\n\nTrump spoke with his supporters during a rally in the hours leading up to the mob taking over the U.S. Capitol. In his speech, he told the thousands present \"we must stop the steal.\"\n\nSo far, investigators have reached deep into Trump's inner circle, contacting former Vice President Mike Pence and the former president's son-in-law to testify before the grand juries in Washington, D.C.\n\nSecretaries of State in several states were also reportedly interviewed as part of the investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. CNN reported recently that officials in seven key battleground states during the 2020 election, Georgia, New Mexico, Nevada, Michigan, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, that were targeted by Trump and his allies \"to subvert the Electoral College\" were subpoenaed.\n\nAlso, investigators have spoken with dozens of witnesses with knowledge of the final days of the Trump presidency and what he and his team might've done to prevent Biden from taking the White House.\n\nTrump insiders embroiled in the federal investigation have also included attorneys John Eastman and Jeffrey Clark, who both had their phones taken by agents last year during the probe.\n\nGeorgia 2020 election interference\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Megan Varner/Getty Images Megan Varner/Getty Images\n\nIn Fulton County, Ga., which is home to Atlanta, District Attorney Fani Willis has impaneled a grand jury to investigate efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn 2020 election results in the state.\n\nThe criminal investigation was started by Willis after the publication of a phone call in January 2021 of Trump pressuring Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find\" ballots in support of Trump.

At that time, then-Attorney General Bill Barr sided with Trump and said the former president had been acting within the bounds of his office as president. But Judge Kaplan had rejected that position \u2014 only to watch as the new Biden attorney general, Merrick Garland, also extended a legal shield to Trump.\n\nThe change in course added yet another legal burden for Trump, who is fighting criminal charges over accounting for alleged hush money payments in Manhattan, separate federal charges for alleged obstruction and willful retention of highly classified documents at his Florida resort, and a grand jury investigation in Georgia over his attempts to overturn the results of that 2020 presidential election in that state.\n\nSeparately, on Tuesday, Trump said that he had received word from the Justice Department that he's a target of the grand jury probe into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. An indictment could be imminent.\n\nRewind to the start of the Carroll legal case\n\nIn 2019, Carroll first publicly came forward saying Trump had raped her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s when the future president was just a businessman.\n\nShe made the allegations with the publication of her memoir What Do We Need Men For: A Modest Proposal.\n\nTrump responded, denying the accusation and saying that the writer had ulterior motives.\n\nCarroll sued Trump \u2014 twice (in 2019 and later in 2022) \u2014 for his public rebuke of her accusation.\n\nThe columnist filed the second lawsuit against Trump (this time for both defamation and rape) after the state of New York lifted the statute of limitations for survivors of sexual assault to file civil claims.\n\nIn May, jurors sided with her in this case. The jury didn't find Trump raped Carroll, however. The jury awarded her $5 million in total damages agreeing that he \"sexually abused\" her and that he defamed her when he denied her story.\n\nBut this case, much like Trump's criminal cases, is far from over.\n\nHer first lawsuit filed in 2019, referred to as Carroll I in the court, was filed for Trump's alleged defamatory statements. Following her victory in May, Carroll and her lawyers asked a court to expand the scope of the Carroll I case against Trump, seeking at least an additional $10 million in damages.\n\nKaplan also said in her statement to NPR that Carroll \"also looks forward to continuing to hold Trump accountable for what he did to her at the trial in Carroll I, which is scheduled to begin on January 15, 2024.\"", "tiktoken_token_count": 772, "llama_token_count": 970}, {"source_name": "NPR", "author": "Carrie Johnson", "title": "Special counsel calls for a speedy trial in Trump's documents case", "description": "Lawyers for the special counsel team pushed back on a bid by former President Donald Trump for an indefinite delay in the  case, calling some of his arguments \"baseless.\"", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2023/07/13/1187591998/special-counsel-speedy-trial-trumps-documents-case", "text": "Special counsel calls for a speedy trial in Trump's documents case\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jose Luis Magana/AP Jose Luis Magana/AP\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith told a federal judge there is \"no basis in law or fact\" for indefinitely postponing the federal trial of former President Donald Trump and urged the court to proceed with jury selection in December.\n\nIn a new court filing, Smith wrote that one of Trump's legal arguments \"borders on frivolous\" and said there's no evidence that waiting until after the 2024 presidential election would make the process any easier.\n\n\"The legal issues Defendants raise do not justify deviation from a speedy trial date, much less open-ended deferral of considering one,\" wrote Smith and assistant special counsel David Harbach.\n\nTrump faces dozens of felony charges for willful retention of national security information, including highly classified papers he allegedly stored in a ballroom and a bathroom at his Florida resort.

It's one of several criminal and civil cases Trump faces as he runs for president.\n\nTrump, who has pleaded not guilty in the documents case, called it an \"empty hoax.\"\n\nThe Justice Department wanted the trial to start in December; Trump's legal team wanted to push it past the 2024 election.\n\nDaniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia Law School, said U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon's order Friday setting a May 20, 2024, trial date was \"an appropriate and reasonable effort to balance the legitimate needs of the defendants against the need to move the case forward as expeditiously as possible.\"\n\nBut the legal complexities involved, the quantity of classified evidence, and Cannon's lack of experience in such a case could contribute to lingering delays and headaches for prosecutors, Richman and other legal experts told NPR.\n\n\"[Cannon] doesn't have any experience in criminal cases involving classified information. She hasn't actually presided over a lengthy jury trial. They've all been short,\" Stephen Saltzburg, a George Washington University law school professor and former Justice Department official, said of Cannon's trial background. \"On another hand, she might bring, as a younger judge, energy to this. But I think this is the kind of case where experience really does matter.\"\n\nWhat are the specific charges against Trump?\n\nTrump faces 37 charges, including more than 30 violations of the Espionage Act, over allegations he stored dozens of classified documents at his Florida resort and refused to return them to the FBI and the National Archives.\n\nHe and his aide, Walt Nauta, are also charged with making false statements and conspiring to obstruct justice. Nauta's trial also starts on May 20.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Trump was personally involved in packing the classified documents as he left the White House in 2021, that he then bragged about having these secret materials and pushed his own lawyer to mislead the FBI about what he had stored at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nA trial date is set. That doesn't mean it will stick\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Lynne Sladky/AP Lynne Sladky/AP\n\nCannon cited the the extensive evidence presented in the case as one of the reasons she pushed the start date to next year.\n\nThis evidence includes \"more than 1.1 million pages of non-classified discovery produced thus far (some unknown quantity of which is described by the Government as \"non-content\"), at least nine months of camera footage (with disputes about pertinent footage), at least 1,545 pages of classified discovery ready to be produced (with more to follow), plus additional content from electronic devices and other sources yet to be turned over,\" Cannon wrote in her order.\n\nTrump and Nauta's teams have applied for a security clearance to go through the stacks of classified material ahead of the trial. This, alone could take weeks or even months to get approved \u2014 potentially pushing back Cannon's deadline even more, said Barbara McQuade, a professor of practice at the University of Michigan Law School and a former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan.\n\nThe attorneys will also be limited to where they can view these records. They won't be able to view the records at their offices or whenever they want to like in an ordinary trial, McQuade noted.\n\n\"They will probably be allowed to review the classified documents only in what's called a SCIF \u2014 a sensitive compartmented information facility \u2014 at the courthouse or at the FBI. They'll have to make appointments to come in and review all of these documents,\" she said.\n\nPulling relevant records to show to the jury is just the discovery phase, \"which in most cases is a pretty straightforward process. But because of the classified nature of the evidence in this case, I think it could be a little more cumbersome and could cause more delay,\" she said.\n\nRichman was more direct: There will undoubtedly be delays in this case.\n\n\"One general rule is that trial dates, in the early stages of a case, are often placeholders and don't mean anything. It's well understood that the date set will slip. That's true in all sorts of cases and I certainly expect it to be true in this case,\" said Richman, a former federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThis case will be tried under CIPA rules. What is that?\n\nTrump's case will be tried within the rules of the Classified Information Procedures Act, or CIPA, a complicated statute that adds difficulties for the government's plans for a speedy trial, legal experts who spoke to NPR for this story said.\n\nCIPA was passed by Congress in 1980 to control the disclosure of classified information in criminal prosecutions and to prevent something called \"graymail.\" This is when a defendant threatens to release classified information, with the aim of forcing the government's hand to drop the case, Saltzburg said.\n\n\"The defense position is: Drop the case if you're not willing to make [classified documents] public,\" he said.\n\nCIPA requires the defense to notify the court of any classified evidence they want to bring up in front of a jury and to submit it as part of the public record. A judge must then decide if this classified information is admissible. Under this federal law, the government can introduce an unclassified alternative that doesn't reflect any classified information.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Department of Justice via Getty Images U.S. Department of Justice via Getty Images\n\n\"The first thing you're supposed to do is see whether you can come up with a substitute. And that is: A non-classified version of the same thing that will give the defendant a fair trial. And that's not always easy\" and it can take a lot of time to come up with, Saltzburg said.\n\nSubmitting a summary of a classified document rather than showing the actual document is one option, he said. \"But the defense may object to say it's not a fair picture. I'm sure there's going to be fights about it\" in Trump's case, Saltzburg said.\n\nProsecuting cases with classified documents is hard. Just look at the Oliver North case\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chris Wilkins/AFP via Getty Images Chris Wilkins/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIf an alternative can't be found, it's possible charges against Trump could be dropped, Saltzburg said.\n\nThis has happened before.\n\nSaltzburg was part of the prosecutorial team in the criminal trial of Oliver North, who was involved in Iran-Contra affair during the 1980s.\n\n\"Everything got complicated because the North team wanted to show classified documents to the jury to suggest that he was doing what he was essentially ordered to do. And the intelligence agencies did not want those documents released,\" Saltzburg said.\n\nThat case faced lengthy delays. North went on trial for 12 criminal charges only after prosecutors dropped several charges against him.\n\nA 1989 New York Times article on the opening day of the North trial said, \"The case has been reduced somewhat in scope after the special prosecutor, Lawrence E. Walsh, dropped several important conspiracy charges against Mr. North because national secrets would have been disclosed in pressing them.\"\n\nNorth was eventually convicted on three felony charges, but those convictions were later reversed and all charges dismissed in the '90s.\n\nGiven these difficulties with CIPA and classified records, Saltzburg and Alan B. Morrison, an associate dean at George Washington University Law School, wrote an op-ed saying they think prosecutors \"should withdraw all but half a dozen\" of Trump's 31 counts of wrongful possession of classified records.\n\n\"The fact that there were as many as 200 classified documents in unsecured locations at his home made the case more serious, but his refusals alone were sufficient reason to indict him,\" they wrote. \"Focusing on his willful refusal to return the documents can shorten the trial and serve to undercut Trump's claim of selective prosecution\u2014 because no one else kept classified documents once the government asked for them back.\"\n\nSaltzburg and Morrison argued that the 31 counts were useful to signal how serious the charges were, but would likely slow down the pretrial process \"as Trump's lawyers will insist on examining each one of them and they will ask the judge for much more trial time so that they can be sure that each record was properly classified. The prosecution should attempt to see if a smaller document sample could be declassified.\"\n\nCannon's experience was questioned early on\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Senate via AP U.S. Senate via AP\n\nCriminal cases involving classified documents are rare, Saltzburg said. \"It's a very small percentage of the criminal cases that are brought throughout the entire United States. But there may be 10 or 15 of them,\" he said.\n\nThey usually come up in national security cases in Washington, D.C., and in the courts in the Eastern District of Virginia and the Southern District of New York, he said. \"Lawyers in those jurisdictions have a lot of experience, so do a lot of the judges, and they know how to move these cases along,\" he said.\n\nBut Trump's case is being heard in a small courtroom in Fort Pierce, Fla., by a judge with no such background.\n\nCannon was appointed by Trump in 2020 and listed herself as a member of the conservative Federalist Society.\n\nHer professional experience includes work as an assistant U.S. attorney for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida in Fort Pierce \u2014 the same city she works out of now as a federal judge, according to the questionnaire she filled out for her judicial nomination in 2020.\n\nIn 2013, Cannon prosecuted 41 cases out of the Major Crimes Division, according to the Associated Press. She later handled appeal cases for criminal convictions and sentences.\n\nShe also worked as an associated attorney at Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher in Washington, D.C., a summer associate at Squire Sanders (now known as Squire Patton Boggs) in Miami and served in a short stint with the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division as a paralegal specialist.\n\nBut it's those ties to Trump as one of his appointees that has raised concern, and questions, over whether Cannon can serve as an unbiased judge in this case.\n\nThere were calls for Cannon to recuse herself almost immediately after she was assigned the case. But her background is pretty standard, according to Richman.\n\n\"She was in the system for quite some time, she came out of a well-respected firm, she got her name pushed forward by her local senator. And yes, she's got a Federalist background, but so do quite a few other judges,\" Richman said.\n\nMcQuade said, \"I think the fact that she's been appointed by Trump is not relevant. We accept the notion in this country that judges get appointed by presidents of both parties and that when they take the bench they are supposed to be independent. That's why they're appointed for life.\"\n\nMcQuade said as for Cannon's perceived lack of experience: \"Every judge is new at some point. Judges are randomly assigned [cases] and some are new and that's just the way it goes. Over time she will become experienced.\"\n\nCannon's early actions in this case rightfully raised some red flags, lawyers say\n\nCannon is the same judge who ruled in favor of Trump's request to appoint a special master to review documents seized by the FBI from Mar-a-Lago last summer. This temporarily prevented federal prosecutors from continuing their investigation into the former president's possession of classified documents. Cannon also ruled to unseal a list of items the FBI seized from their search of Trump's home.\n\nThis ruling sparked serious pushback from the Justice Department and some in the legal community who questioned Cannon's legal rationale in that decision.\n\nAnd it's criticism and serious concerns that Saltzburg, McQuade and Richman shared.\n\n\"I think people are concerned about her mostly because of the way she ruled in that search warrant matter, which was, to me really obviously wrong,\" McQuade said.\n\nCannon's decision to request that special master was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nSaltzburg said his feelings on Cannon changed when on Friday she pushed the start date of the classified documents trial until May 2024 and issued a detailed schedule of hearings for both sides to adhere to.\n\n\"This is just what I would expect from a judge who had experience in classified information cases,\" he said. \"It is impressive and shows considerable thought. If Judge Cannon sticks by the schedule, she will have demonstrated an ability to control a complicated case.\"", "tiktoken_token_count": 2619, "llama_token_count": 3139}, {"source_name": "NPR", "author": "Carrie Johnson", "title": "DOJ won't shield Trump from claims he defamed writer E.

Jean Carroll\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Rourke/AP Matt Rourke/AP\n\nThe Justice Department said it will decline to shield former President Trump from a defamation claim by New York writer E. Jean Carroll, reversing course on one of its most controversial decisions during the early stretch of the Biden administration.\n\nThe department notified attorneys for Trump and Carroll of the move late Tuesday afternoon. In papers filed with a federal judge in New York, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton said DOJ determined that it \"lacks adequate evidence to conclude\" Trump was serving the federal government and acting within the scope of his employment when he denied he had sexually assaulted Carroll and made other derogatory remarks about her.\n\nThe change in course is a significant one. If the Justice Department had decided Trump were covered under a law called the Westfall Act, he would, in essence, have secured immunity from the civil claims. That's because federal workers are shielded from those kinds of lawsuits so long as the workers are acting within the bounds of their jobs.\n\nRoberta Kaplan, a lawyer for Carroll, said she was grateful for the new position from the department.\n\n\"We have always believed that Donald Trump made his defamatory statements about our client in June 2019 out of personal animus, ill will, and spite, and not as President of the United States,\" Kaplan said in an emailed statement. \"Now that one of the last obstacles has been removed, we look forward to trial in E Jean Carroll's original case in January 2024.\"\n\nLawyers for Trump had no immediate comment on the reversal.\n\nThe case has worked its way not only through the New York federal court system, but also the D.C. Court of Appeals. Last year, that D.C. court said the analysis under the Westfall Act required some \"purpose\" to serve the employer.\n\nThe Justice Department said it reviewed the court ruling, Trump's deposition, new allegations in Carroll's complaint and the jury verdict in a separate case Carroll won against Trump earlier this year. That jury took just a few hours to find Trump liable for battery and defamation, awarding Carroll millions of dollars in damages.\n\nAmong the factors DOJ mentioned in court papers Tuesday to explain its new position are that Trump made negative remarks about Carroll even after he left office, added fuel to the fire with new comments this year after the New York jury verdict and the alleged sexual assault \"was obviously not job related.\"\n\n\"The evidence of Mr. Trump's state of mind, some of which has come to light only after the Department last made a certification decision, does not establish that he made the statements at issue with a 'more than insignificant' purpose to serve the United States Government,\" DOJ official Boynton wrote.\n\nCarroll filed the defamation lawsuit three years ago. At that time, then-Attorney General Bill Barr sided with Trump and said Trump had been acting within the bounds of his office as president. But Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected that position \u2014 only to watch as the new Biden attorney general, Merrick Garland, also extended a legal shield to Trump.\n\nThe Biden Justice Department said Trump had drafted and made the negative remarks while he was in the White House, in response to questions from reporters. And DOJ pointed out that \"the former President was responding to allegations that could have called into question his fitness to hold the office of the Presidency.\"\n\nThe change in course adds yet another legal burden for Trump, who is fighting criminal charges over accounting for alleged hush money payments in Manhattan and separate federal charges for alleged obstruction and willful retention of highly classified documents at his Florida resort.", "tiktoken_token_count": 735, "llama_token_count": 890}, {"source_name": "NPR", "author": "Jaclyn Diaz", "title": "Rudy Giuliani concedes he made false statements against 2 Georgia election workers", "description": "Giuliani submitted this declaration as part of the ongoing civil lawsuit filed in 2021 by election workers Ruby Freeman and Wandrea \"Shaye\" Moss.

Fox News Network\n\nAttorney says Epps fled home out of fears for his family's safety\n\nAccording to Epps' attorney, Michael Teter, Epps and his wife were Fox viewers and Carlson fans whose lives were turned upside down by the network.\n\n\"Fox News and in particular Tucker Carlson spent a good part of two years lying about Mr. Epps's involvement in January 6th, creating a fictitious story and narrative about him that is wholly untrue,\" Teter tells NPR. \"And because of that he has faced harassment and threats from Fox viewers and others that have ruined his life.\"\n\nEpps has said he and his wife had to sell their home \u2014 and give up their wedding business \u2014 and move to a mobile home in Utah.\n\n\"He believed in Donald Trump and he believed the lies that Fox told,\" Teter says. \"The fact that then Fox would take one of their viewers and turn him into the villain of one of their conspiracy theories demonstrates what we've known for a while, which is Fox News does not care [about its viewers].\"\n\n\"It cares about making money,\" Teter says. \"And it will lie to them. It will discredit them. And ultimately it will ruin their lives if they see a profit for them to be made.\"\n\nA growing list of lawsuits against Fox News over election-related falsehoods\n\nEpps' suit is just the latest legal front against Fox, the result of its lurching embrace of Trump's false claims that he had been cheated of victory in the 2020 race.\n\nFox was the first television network to project that Democratic nominee Joe Biden would win Arizona. The call outraged many of its core viewers, who defected to other right-wing outlets.\n\nAs contemporaneous reporting and documents and testimony in a later court case would demonstrate, executives and stars amplified the increasingly outlandish claims in order to win back those viewers.\n\nThat decision proved costly and fateful to its credibility, as Fox hosts and executives agreed to air claims they knew to be false, and to its bottom line.\n\nFox News paid $787.5 million earlier this year to settle a defamation claim brought by a voting-technology company called Dominion Voting Systems, which was frequently placed at the center of those groundless conspiracy theories.\n\nPlaintiffs who sue media organizations for defamation face long odds. They must prove not only that the claims made about them were false and harmful, but that the people spreading those claims knew they were false, or should've known and recklessly disregarded the truth.\n\nYet Fox's settlement with Dominion, just moments before opening statements in the trial were to begin, gives others reason to hope.\n\n\"The Dominion settlement has emboldened other targets of Fox's coverage to sue, and that's not good news for Fox,\" says Tom Wienner, a retired corporate litigator who followed the Dominion case at NPR's request.\n\nEpps' suit is being heard in the same venue, Delaware Superior Court.\n\nFallout from a $787.5 million legal settlement\n\nDays after the Dominion settlement, Fox stripped Carlson of his primetime show, seeking to sideline him until his current contract ends, which is after the upcoming elections. According to Chadwick Moore, who has written a biography of Carlson, his show was to focus once more on Epps the evening that he was ousted.\n\nCarlson was one of the primary defendants in the Dominion suit, which showed him to be privately attacking the network's reporters for publicly contradicting Trump even though, as he acknowledged, they were correct.\n\n\"The Dominion suit... demonstrates a pattern on Fox that they have engaged in lies about the 2020 election, seeking to placate their viewers,\" Teter says. \"They wanted the frustration \u2014 the anger \u2014 that their viewers expected, to continue to have them watching Fox News.\"\n\nLate last month, Fox paid $12 million to settle a lawsuit from a former senior producer for Carlson who alleged his show's work environment was replete with bigotry and misogyny in her own civil suit. She had separately alleged that attorneys for the network and its parent company, Fox Corp., had pressured her to lie to defend Carlson and male executives in sworn testimony. Fox vigorously contested the allegation of misconduct by its legal team but backed down from its initial defenses of the work environment on Carlson's show.\n\nMeanwhile, Fox faces another lawsuit for $2.7 billion from a second voting tech company, Smartmatic. And investors have brought a pair of lawsuits, arguing that top officials and board members at Fox Corp. failed to exercise appropriate control over the network.\n\nFox seeks to have Epps case moved to another venue\n\nFox News and Fox Corp endured tough sledding in the Delaware Superior Court during the Dominion case. After months of being asked by Dominion, for example, Fox's attorneys belatedly acknowledged that Fox Corp. founder and chairman Rupert Murdoch also held the title of executive chairman of Fox News.\n\nDelaware Superior Court Judge Eric M. Davis, who oversaw the Dominion case, chastised Fox's attorneys on that score and several others. And Davis has been assigned related cases. It is perhaps unsurprising that Fox's attorneys have filed a legal notice seeking to have the Epps case moved to federal court in Delaware.\n\nOther Fox hosts stoked the emotional fires that fueled the January 2021 protests to a greater degree than Carlson. Yet after the siege, Carlson quickly embraced a series of contradictory conspiracy theories. He argued that the brutal attack was essentially a rally that got a bit rowdy. And he also claimed that the federal government and antigovernmental protesters from Antifa instigated it.\n\nEpps became a touchstone in reconciling those so far baseless theories. Carlson's claims, presented on his show and in a three-part series called Patriot Purge on the Fox Nation streaming service, led to the resignations of two Fox commentators, Jonah Goldberg and Stephen Hayes. Anchor Bret Baier and then-Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace objected to top network officials. Wallace signed with CNN shortly after.\n\nAs recently as this March, however, Carlson once more invoked the specter of federal involvement in the attack on the Capitol.\n\n\"A lot of this was clearly influenced by federal agents or informants. It was. Ok?\" Carlson told viewers. \"But I did not want to suggest someone was a federal agent or informant unless I knew for a fact because you really could get someone in trouble.\"\n\n\"It's very clear, something very strange is going on with Ray Epps,\" he said. \"I mean, don't lie to my face. The Ray Epps thing isn't, isn't organic, sorry.\"", "tiktoken_token_count": 1702, "llama_token_count": 2111}, {"source_name": "NPR", "author": "Suzanne Nuyen", "title": "Up First briefing: Barbenheimer; Trump indictments; Baghdadi raid investigation", "description": "Get ready for a Barbie/Oppenheimer double feature.

Wade protection for abortion rights, the same six members of the U.S. Supreme Court have banned affirmative action \u2014 the explicit use of race as a factor in college admissions.\n\nDesigned to address centuries of inequality in education, affirmative action had been a feature of the past several decades and was upheld by multiple Supreme Court rulings over that period. Now, the court has denounced the practice as a form of racial discrimination that violates the 14th Amendment, which was itself enacted to enfranchise the formerly enslaved.\n\nThis week's affirmative action ruling was nearly as notable a departure from precedent as last year's spiking of Roe, which had been the law of the land for half a century before the court called it \"egregiously wrong.\"\n\nIt was a rare combination of two such far-reaching reversals, and it was accompanied by other rulings on sensitive issues by the same six justices. The combined effect has focused national attention on the court's dramatic swing to the right.\n\nThe most immediate explanation for the earthquake is the weight of three conservative justices appointed by former President Donald Trump and confirmed by a Republican-controlled Senate during his term. Trump was able to fill more seats in a single term than any president since Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nBut that is far from the whole story.\n\nThe current supermajority on the court exists because of major political factors that have favored Republicans in the postwar era and historic circumstances that were windows of opportunity for all six conservatives to be appointed and confirmed.\n\nThe Electoral College and the fortune of timing\n\nThe longest-serving member of the current court, Clarence Thomas, was confirmed in 1991. At the time, Republicans had won the popular vote for president in seven of the previous ten election cycles (1952 - 1988).\n\nBut in the eight presidential elections since then, Republicans have won the popular vote only once. Two Republicans who lost the popular vote reached the Oval Office by prevailing in the Electoral College.\n\nThose two \u2014 George W. Bush and Donald Trump \u2014 would eventually appoint the five justices who, with Thomas, make up the current 6-3 conservative supermajority.\n\nThe biggest contributor on this score was Trump's 2016 win in the Electoral College against Hillary Clinton. George W. Bush also came to the presidency initially via the Electoral College after losing the popular vote to Al Gore in 2000. (Bush did win the popular vote in his reelection year, before he appointed any justices.)\n\nRepublicans have also had far more luck in having Supreme Court vacancies occur when they controlled the White House and a working majority in the Senate.\n\nWhile the presidency itself has swung between the two parties with some regularity since World War II, with Republicans holding the office for 40 years and Democrats for 38, no Democratic president in all those decades has been able to appoint and confirm a chief justice. By contrast, four of the six Republican presidents in that same period \u2014 Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush \u2014 have named a chief justice.\n\nOverall, in the 54 years since Nixon first took office, there have been 20 confirmed appointments to the court, counting chiefs and associate justices. Republican presidents have had 15 of them, Democratic presidents just five.\n\nCentrists as an endangered species\n\nThroughout its history the Supreme Court has made momentous political decisions, driven at times by strong ideological leanings. But it has also had a tradition of idealizing a nonpartisan consensus and seeking unanimity whenever possible. It is a tradition the current chief justice often salutes and, at least at times, seems eager to serve.\n\nIn the past, as a rule, the Senate defaulted to confirming nominees in deference to the president \u2014 even across party lines. If there was not an egregious issue or personal matter, the vote was often lopsided. Reagan appointee Antonin Scalia, a true conservative icon, was confirmed in 1986 without a dissenting vote.\n\nMoreover, individual justices at times seemed to evolve in their views and alliances during their time on the court, sometimes frustrating the president who appointed them or elements of his party.\n\nFor example, when Thomas was appointed in 1991, seven other sitting justices had been appointed by Republicans, and an eighth was appointed by a Democrat but had a conservative record. Yet for all its party unity, the court of that time was not regarded as particularly conservative. Two of its members would come to be viewed as part of its \"liberal wing\" (David Souter and John Paul Stevens), two Reagan appointees were regarded as moderates or centrists (Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy) and a fifth, Harry Blackmun, had been the author of Roe v. Wade.\n\nBut change was already underway to nominate justices who would more reliably keep a conservative bent.\n\ntoggle caption J. David Ake/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe highly partisan battle over Reagan appointee Robert Bork, whom the Senate rejected in 1987 after liberals blasted his record, had poisoned the well.\n\nThomas had an ideological profile much akin to Bork's, but he was confirmed in part because he declined to state opinions about controversial issues.\n\nHis hearing was not without controversy, however. Thomas faced accusations of sexual harassment by a former co-worker named Anita Hill. Thomas \u2014 who is Black and was nominated to fill the vacancy left by Thurgood Marshall, the only African American ever to serve on the court at the time \u2014 called Hill's televised testimony \"a high-tech lynching for uppity Blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves.\"\n\nThomas' nomination was confirmed by the full Senate 52 to 48, saved by the votes of 11 Democrats unwilling to oppose him.\n\nCampus organization seizes power: The Federalist Society\n\nBack in 1991, Thomas was the first new justice on the court who had been associated with the Federalist Society, a campus gathering of conservative law students and faculty at Yale, the University of Chicago and other schools. Rising up in the wake of Roe, the group was formally founded in 1982.\n\nPolitics What Is The Federalist Society And How Does It Affect Supreme Court Picks?

Listen \u00b7 4:14 4:14\n\nTheir animating idea was that federal judges were arrogating too much power to themselves and playing fast and loose with the Constitution to accommodate their own policy preferences. Many of the rulings of the Supreme Court under Chief Warren Burger and his predecessor Earl Warren were regarded as egregious examples of \"activist judges\" run amok.\n\nSince then, the Society has grown and prospered in numbers, influence and fundraising prowess. Succeeding perhaps beyond its dreams, it now counts the six conservative members of the Supreme Court among its current or former members. It has had no small role in their elevation, aggressively recruiting and promoting candidates for the bench and supporting conservative Republican candidates for president.\n\nThe current court's conservative majority is now often seen as a Federalist Society majority.\n\nThe breakthrough year of 2005\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Paul J. Richards/AFP via Getty Images Paul J. Richards/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSignificant as it was to see the first President Bush nominate Thomas, the real breakthrough for movement conservatives in legal circles came in 2005. The circumstances were unique and highly personal.\n\nO'Connor, who in 1982 became the first woman to join the court, decided to retire a bit early to spend more time with her husband, who was ill. She announced her retirement in 2005, and the just-reelected President W. Bush named John Roberts, a former Reagan adviser who had become a federal appeals court judge, to replace her. Roberts had been a Harvard undergrad and law student and had a reputation as a high-powered intellect.\n\nBut before Roberts could be confirmed, the court's senior-most member, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, died. So Bush withdrew his nomination for the O'Connor seat and put him up for chief instead in September 2005. Roberts' hearings began a week later, and he was confirmed in time for the court's traditional opening on the first Monday of October.\n\nThe Roberts hearings were largely non-contentious. Only minor controversies had arisen concerning Roberts' career, and he handled questions about his views with aplomb, referring to the court's task as that of an \"umpire calling balls and strikes.\"\n\nThe O'Connor vacancy was to be filled by Bush's White House counsel, Harriet Miers, a Texan and a longtime associate of the Bush family. It seemed appropriate to replace O'Connor with another woman, and while Miers had not been a judge and was little known in the legal community, she had the support of some prominent Democrats in the Senate.\n\nThe problem arose on the other side, as a number of prominent conservatives denounced the choice. Bork called it a \"disaster\" and a \"slap in the face\" to the conservative movement that had been \"building up ... for the last 20 years,\" a reference to the Federalist Society. The movement conservatives did not trust Miers to toe their line, as she did not have a history of ruling in the cases they cared most about.\n\nAs president of the Texas State Bar, she had supported an affirmative action program for women and minorities. The critics feared \"another Souter,\" a reference to the first justice chosen by the first President Bush. The opposition grew loud enough that Miers chose to withdraw her name from candidacy.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nAt that point, Bush called on a prospect he had first interviewed years earlier for an appellate court position, Samuel Alito, who had actually been at Yale with Thomas in the 1970s. While he satisfied Miers' detractors, Alito also stirred the opposition party to action. Although Democrats had only 44 lawmakers in the Senate that fall, they had enough votes to mount a filibuster if they chose to, and there were Republicans willing to at least consider voting no.\n\nAmong those withholding commitments on Alito was a first-year senator from Illinois who had been a Harvard law student and a law professor at Chicago. His name was Barack Obama, and he declared himself \"concerned that President Bush has wasted an opportunity to appoint a consensus nominee in the mold of [O'Connor] and has instead made a selection to appease the far right-wing of the Republican Party.\"\n\nSen. Edward Kennedy, a senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, interviewed Alito and took careful notes for his diary (later shared with biographer John A. Farrell). Kennedy asked Alito about Roe and recorded this as his answer: \"I am a believer in precedents, people would find I adhere to that.\" But Kennedy was not convinced.\n\nKennedy had also written in his diary that he found Roberts \"bright and smart and compelling,\" but that when he sought Roberts' commitments on social justice issues, Roberts \"didn't want to get into that at all.\" Kennedy would eventually vote against both the Bush nominees.\n\nEighteen years later, it was Roberts who signed the opinion that erased affirmative action in college admissions this week.\n\nConfirmation drama returns\n\nThe Alito hearings began the first week of January 2006, in an atmosphere of tension. Confirming Roberts to the Rehnquist vacancy was one thing, but Alito was taking the place of O'Connor, who had been a vote for moderation on abortion and racial gerrymandering and other issues.\n\nThe Democratic leader at the time and some of the chamber's liberals were ready to filibuster, protesting the choice of a candidate as ideological as they believed Alito to be.\n\nThe questions in the hearing room were tough. Alito had denied being a member of a certain alumni group that wanted fewer women and minorities admitted to Princeton, but evidence emerged that he had cited such a membership in the past. The questioning grew more hostile. There was talk of a subpoena for records of the group.\n\nOn the third day, one of the Republicans on the committee, Lindsey Graham, praised Alito and regretted what the nominee was enduring. Alito's wife, Martha-Ann Bomgardner, began to cry and left the room in tears after Graham sarcastically had asked Alito: \"Are you really a closet bigot?\" She later returned, composed and holding her husband's hand. But the image of her looking distraught became the focus of the day's proceeding in the media.\n\nAfter that, the mood in the hearing room was palpably different, and the steam soon went out of the filibuster talk. Years later, as a president seeking support for his own court nominees, Obama would say he regretted entertaining the idea of a filibuster against Alito.\n\nAt the time, Democrats were increasingly focused on that fall's election, one in which they hoped to recapture the Senate majority. So the filibuster did not happen. Later that month, with just one Republican breaking ranks against him and four Democrats in favor, Alito was confirmed 58-42.\n\nLast year, Alito wrote the decision in the Dobbs case that overturned Roe.", "tiktoken_token_count": 2686, "llama_token_count": 3288}]}, {"query": {"get_url": "https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?", "q": "Cactus", "from": "2023-06-28", "sort_by": "popularity"}, "articles": [{"source_name": "The Guardian", "author": "Andrea Meanwell", "title": "Country diary: We \u2018ladies with livestock\u2019 look after each other | Andrea Meanwell", "description": "Langdale, Cumbria: Today we meet on Jennie\u2019s farm.

But what has been maintained, according to Lenovo, is a longstanding ethos of making the highest quality products with the least environmental impact.\n\nThat might sound fairly vanilla to you, but Lenovo really has been leading the charge to more eco-friendly tech over the past decade. The company moved to 100% recycled packaging way back in 2008 and has even gone to experiment with bamboo and sugarcane-based materials.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nBut Lenovo has new tricks up its sleeve. I was invited to visit the Lenovo headquarters in Raleigh to see the innovations firsthand and to see if there was any validity to the company\u2019s confident claims about its industry-leading sustainability initiatives.\n\nPackaging and materials\n\nSimilar to many other laptop manufacturers, Lenovo has delved into its sustainability efforts very easily through its packaging. The eco-friendly tan Lenovo box is as synonymous with the brand as its red logo. Made of bamboo and sugarcane fiber, the boxes are easily recyclable and compostable. The company said it chose these materials because of their fast growth and easy accessibility. To look inside a Lenovo box further shows a meticulous effort to shy away from materials that are harmful to the planet.\n\nDevices, and even accessories such as USB-C to HDMI and RJ45 cables, are also housed in linen bags made of bamboo and sugarcane fiber instead of plastic. Cardboard bumpers that keep products in place are made of the same materials. Beyond that, Lenovo is making efforts to make its entire packaging plastic-free, putting detail into changing twist ties from plastic-coated to paper-coated and using paper-based security labels as opposed to plastic. Text on the packaging is also printed with water-based ink. Such efforts have already been implemented into product lines such as the ThinkPad series.\n\nLenovo says the lessons it learned from its packaging are starting to be transferred to sourcing materials across many of its product lines. Using not only recycled plastics, fabrics, and foraged aluminum but also introducing new materials from eco-friendly sources as well as from sources unique to the technology space. The company noted its new Z series devices are made of 75% foraged aluminum which is energy- and consumption-saving, while its Yoga series devices are made of 50% recycled fabric, and its Tab P12 Pro first Android tablet in the world made of 100% recycled aluminum.\n\n\u201cThis year in our look into trends around sustainability we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a shift around micro-trends from materials only to materials, processes, to manufacturing, everything,\u201d Lenovo PCSD Senior Design Manager Strategic Design and Innovation, Ali Elliott said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of new natural materials. We\u2019re also seeing a huge jump for design that includes apparent sustainability from the jump.\u201d\n\nThe company has invested in a number of new sources that are not only eco-friendly but aesthetically pleasing. Accessories for the ThinkPad Z series include cases made of vegan leather sourced from cactus plants. The ThinkPad X1 series, meanwhile, is a longstanding laptop line that is made with recycled nylon.\n\nThe covers for laptops in the Legion gaming series are made of the fuselage or the carbon fiber innards of airplanes. Using reclaimed waste material sourced from Boeing, the bits are hammered down into patterns that ultimately make the covers unique to each model. Similarly, the cover of the ThinkPad Z13 was created from woven stalks of flaxseed plants and bonded in a biodegradable resin. The stalks are also a waste product, and in the weaving process make a unique design for the cover of each ThinkPad Z13 model. Lenovo notes it doesn\u2019t have any exclusivity to using flaxseed stalks as a material, it is simply first to market. The ThinkPad Z13 also features a 75% recycled aluminum frame and it ships in one of the 100% plastic-free boxes.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at a product, we want to make sure we\u2019re introducing sustainable materials into as many components of that as we possibly can,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nFuturistic design\n\nAs Lenovo makes way for future endeavors, it is taking into consideration the wants and needs of its customers. Among those talks are long-standing discussions about customization, modulation, and how much consumers want to be involved in the repair of their devices. Lenovo notes these conversations will shape the look and feel of devices for years and decades to come.\n\n\u201cCustomers vary. There is a wide spectrum of what customers in commercial or consumer spaces are wanting. What kinds of changes they are sensitive to and when it comes to repair itself, with a spectrum of abilities and awareness about that issue,\u201d Lenovo Group Operations Distinguished Designer and Head of Next UX User & Customer Experience, Aaron Stewart said.\n\nHaving done a consumer study of repair preferences, Lenovo learned that repairability was important to most consumers when considering a laptop for purchase. Delving deeper into these thoughts, the company found 60% preferred repairs to be done by manufacturers, while 20% preferred some sort of DIY option.\n\nThe research has led Lenovo to consider several repurpose and repair options that could benefit consumers that might be a little more hands-on. Called Project Aurora, it remains in the concept phase, but is Lenovo exploring methods of execution.\n\n\u201cWe looked at how we could arrange components in devices. We\u2019re studying the effects of building differently. It\u2019s about assessing approaches to repair and upgrade. We don\u2019t have the final answer on this, but we\u2019re looking at which components need to be repaired the most and which ones should be more accessible,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nLenovo said it sees such a project rolling out initially for enterprise customers. Other options under the research entail allowing certain standardized parts of products to be refashioned and upcycled into a new product at the end of life. For example, a functional display on a laptop could be removed and repurposed as a smart display. Lenovo also envisions devices with various detachable parts that customers can send back to the manufacturer to have replacement parts shipped back for them to reattach manually. Questions the company is still grappling with are how can these efforts be not only feasible but sustainable at the same time.\n\nDell\u2019s Project Luna might be the most fully realized concept of sustainable, repairable laptops that we currently have. But Lenovo seems to be determined to not get left behind in this regard.\n\nWater cooling for sustainability\n\nOutside of Lenovo\u2019s hardware and material efforts, the company has also developed technology that benefits sustainability on a massive solution-based scale. Its Neptune liquid cooling system has been implemented into supercomputers in data centers across the world as an option to offset the rapidly increasing power demands on components such as GPUs, CPUs, memory, and network adapters, but also the power that it takes to keep systems cool.\n\nStandard data centers are typically cooled by air, with a cold aisle in front of the servers and a hot aisle in the back. Air is cycled down through racks in an air conditioning system to be cooled and up again when it\u2019s warm to repeat the process.\n\n\u201cAnywhere between 30% and 40% of any server is used to pull the system. It\u2019s just used to run the fans. It\u2019s not calculating data. It\u2019s not moving data. It\u2019s not storing data. It\u2019s just moving air,\u201d Lenovo Infrastructure Solutions Group Director of Marketing High Performance and Artificial Intelligence, Patrick Moakley said.\n\nWith components expected to quickly increase in specs and power capacity in the coming years, any methods for power reduction and efficiency are welcome by organizations utilizing supercomputers.\n\nThe industry is expected to produce CPUs at 500 watts and GPUs at 700 watts. Keeping in mind that smaller components, including memory and network adapters also consume power, companies might have to invest in computers that consume 1,000 watts per system, Moakley added.\n\nThe Neptune liquid cooling system works as a dry cooler, similar to an automotive radiator with liquid flowing through the coils inside a supercomputer, which interacts with the ambient air to keep the water and the system cool. This method automatically erases the 30% and 40% power expenditure it takes to cool systems when data processing.\n\n\u201cFor those dry coolers to operate, you just need a temperature difference between the water and the ambient air outside. So when the air is cooler than the water exiting, then the act of blowing air over those coils, the heat will naturally be dissipated from the water and go to the universe to then be cool. And then return the water, more importantly back to the end that water temperature that we require for these services,\u201d Lenovo Thermal Engineer, Scott Holland said.\n\nThis is where Lenovo\u2019s liquid cooling system steps in as a two-fold benefit of helping organizations maintain or even increase their performance with water while having the source be an efficient byproduct that can be used elsewhere.\n\n\u201cYou get up to a point where you\u2019ve got cool water coming in. You discharge warm water going out. The benefit to having warm water coming out of the system as opposed to warm air is it\u2019s really, really difficult to contain warm air. Warm water is contained. I can do something with it. I can send that to some other place within my campus,\u201d Moakley said.\n\nLenovo has collaborated with a multitude of organizations globally on water recycling such as heating pools and heating buildings. Its partners include Harvard University, Yale University, Max Planck Institutes, Barcelona Supercomputing Center, National Computational Infrastructure, and the Indian Space Research Organization, among others.\n\nWith data center power having almost quadrupled in the last decade and expected to quadruple again by the end of the decade, it is likely even more organizations will soon be interested in alternative cooling methods.\n\nA long way to go\n\nWith e-waste growing beyond the massive problem that it already is, all of these advances might feel like baby steps. And in a lot of ways, they are. It\u2019s crazy to think that with all the innovation we\u2019ve experienced around technology the issue of sustainability remains so elusive. It seems that cheap, wasteful materials are so engrained into the fabric of how our technology works that ditching them would require a total reboot in how we think about tech.\n\nCompanies like Lenovo might not be able to abandon their current way of manufacturing laptops, but there\u2019s no doubt in my mind \u2014 the issues of sustainability are no longer an afterthought. Processes are being reconsidered, experiments are being undertaken, and products are being reimagined. We\u2019re a long way from the sustainability revolution, but the gears have begun to turn.\n\nEditors' Recommendations", "tiktoken_token_count": 2132, "llama_token_count": 2633}, {"source_name": "The Washington Post", "author": "Benjamin Breen", "title": "Shifting views about psychedelic drugs require a new category for them", "description": "Culture, norms and laws are changing \u2014 but history says that demands an even bigger rethinking.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/made-by-history/2023/06/29/psychedelics-drugs/", "text": "Listen 7 min Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\nAn NFL quarterback, a progeny of Hollywood royalty and a former governor of Texas walk into a hotel where the world\u2019s most significant conference on psychedelics is underway. It may sound like something from a television show, but it\u2019s real. As The Washington Post reported, the speakers at the Psychedelic Science 2023 conference, which wrapped up on Friday in Denver, included NFL star Aaron Rodgers, rapper Jaden Smith and former Texas governor and energy secretary Rick Perry.\n\nTheir presence at the conference exemplifies a larger transformation in how we as a society think about the cultural, legal and medical role of psychedelic substances like psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca and MDMA.\n\nThe conference is part of a drumbeat of news about these drugs, from new breakthroughs in the science itself to the decision of voters in Colorado and Oregon to legalize adult use of psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms. Given recent opinion polls, it seems clear that it is not just the laws and science around psychedelics that are changing, but also the culture: Americans are moving away from stigmatizing the drugs and toward recognizing that they potentially have real benefits for the treatment of addiction, depression and PTSD.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this new landscape demands more than just new laws. It also requires a new category for psychedelics. Are they recreational drugs? Are they medicines? Are they religious sacraments? History and science argue that they are all three \u2014 and more \u2014 and how we categorize them is going to be important in determining their place in American society.\n\nThe history of drugs is, in large part, a history of humans attempting and failing to categorize substances that readily evade the labels we place on them. In 1623, for instance, the early modern English philosopher Francis Bacon classified opiates as \u201cnarcotic\u201d drugs \u2014 a surprisingly contemporary-sounding label from a figure who lived at the same time as Shakespeare. But Bacon then suggested that coffee, too, \u201cappears to be a kind of Opiate.\u201d His reasoning? Though coffee \u201cadds Strength and Vigour both to the Mind and Body\u201d it also \u201cdisorders the Senses\u201d when taken in high doses.\n\nFor centuries, this ambiguity persisted. And psychedelics like peyote \u2014 a cactus long used as a medicine and sacrament in parts of Mexico and Texas \u2014 were the most ambiguous of all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the earliest Spanish writers in colonial Mexico who described peyote tended to do so in terms of its medicinal role, with one, for instance, describing its virtues as a cure for sore necks. Others noted that the cactus was consumed for use in divination, framing it in Christian terms as a potential tool of the devil. Perhaps the sole point of agreement was that peyote didn\u2019t fit into known categories. As one 16th-century Mexican poet put it: \u201cThe peyote, Lord, watch out for it! This is a thing not found in Spain.\u201d\n\nA century later, traveling among the Indigenous societies of the Peruvian Amazon, a Jesuit missionary named Pablo Maroni seemed equally confused as to how to categorize the psychedelic compound ayahuasca. The DMT-bearing brew, Maroni warned, could \u201cdeprive one of one\u2019s senses, or even of one\u2019s life.\u201d But Maroni also wrote that Amazonian healers used ayahuasca to \u201cto cure common ailments, especially headaches.\u201d\n\nInto the 19th century, psychedelic compounds remained impossible to categorize \u2014 or to ban. Despite pressure from government authorities in colonial Mexico and the United States, peyote continued to pop up in unexpected places, from the rites of the Native American Church to experiments by scientists like the psychologist William James.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the 1920s, however, authorities were starting to lump psychedelics together in the same category that had come to define heroin and cocaine: illicit drugs. In the early 1920s, for instance, anti-drug campaigners sought a federal ban on peyote in the United States. Newspapers at the time warned of \u201cpeyote orgies\u201d and spoke of the severe \u201cdemoralizing effects\u201d of what one account called \u201cthe Indian cocaine.\u201d\n\nThis was the era of Prohibition, when a huge range of substances came to be painted as responsible for a parade of ills, from addiction and disorder to eugenics-inspired ideas like \u201csocial degeneration.\u201d It was also the era when the Federal Bureau of Narcotics \u2014 the predecessor to today\u2019s Drug Enforcement Administration \u2014 came into being. The Bureau was established in 1930 under the leadership of Harry J. Anslinger, a former Prohibition agent and fervent anti-drug crusader. As the FBN and later the DEA expanded their authority, the list of substances classified as \u201cillicit drugs\u201d grew with them.\n\nEven in this environment, however, psychedelic substances managed to escape bans, in part because they were impossible to classify. That provided enough ambiguity for some to argue that they had scientific value and should remain legal. One early theory, championed by a group of psychiatrists, neurologists and consciousness-researchers, held that psychedelics mirrored the symptoms of schizophrenia. This misguided claim gave rise to the short-lived category of psychotomimetics, or \u201cpsychosis-mimicking\u201d drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs early trials of psychedelic therapy began to show promising results \u2014 and as scientists began sampling the drugs themselves \u2014 a new paradigm emerged. In 1957, one of those scientists, Humphry Osmond, proposed a more neutral term: psychedelic, derived from the ancient Greek for \u201cmind-manifesting.\u201d Thus began yet another failed attempt to put psychedelics in a conceptual box: the utopian era of psychedelic science, typified by the Harvard lecturer Timothy Leary who claimed, in 1961, that LSD offered a pathway to \u201cdrug-induced satori\u201d: a kind of chemical enlightenment.\n\nThe fierce backlash to the overheated claims of Leary and his compatriots helped prompt bans at the state and federal level. In 1970, Congress officially classified psychedelics as \u201cSchedule One\u201d drugs. This designation meant that they were deemed to have no medicinal benefits and \u201ca high potential for abuse.\u201d Substances which, just a decade before, had been celebrated as potentially revolutionary psychiatric treatments were now in the same category as heroin and methamphetamine.\n\nAs the DEA celebrates its 50th anniversary in July, and as psychedelics continue their march toward cultural and legal acceptance, the time is ripe to rethink not just the laws around psychedelics, but the conceptual boxes we place them in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is a new category needed? Not only are the existing categories inadequate on the level of science and history \u2014 they are also downright harmful. Psychedelics like psilocybin have a remarkably benign safety profile relative to other Schedule One drugs, not to mention very different social, cultural and historical roles. Lumping psychedelics together with powerful opioids like fentanyl misdirects resources, diminishes buy-in from the public and undercuts the legitimacy of federal drug laws. In short, it does real harm to attempts to regulate the category of drugs responsible for the vast majority of overdose deaths: synthetic opioids.\n\nYet attempting to cram psychedelics into other boxes \u2014 legal pharmaceuticals, \u201cplant medicines\u201d or religious sacraments \u2014 poses problems of its own. Although efforts to bring psychedelics to market as FDA-approved psychiatric treatments are well underway, it is doubtful whether the category of \u201cprescription drug\u201d will ever be able to contain them, because of their varied uses. And though psychedelics have been used in religious rites for thousands of years, this has never been their sole function \u2014 nor can it be, in a world in which a significant percentage of the global population self-identifies as atheist.\n\nAs we redefine our society\u2019s stance toward these fascinatingly protean substances, then, we should be mindful of their category-defying history.\n\nPsychedelics have been an integral part of human culture and experience since long before the concept of \u201cdrugs\u201d even emerged. Perhaps one lesson of these mind-expanding substances is that to truly harness their potential, we will need to expand the ways we think and talk about them, too.\n\nGift this article Gift Article", "tiktoken_token_count": 1706, "llama_token_count": 2100}, {"source_name": "Subanima.org", "author": "Jake Brown", "title": "The Forgotten Piece of Evolutionary Theory", "description": "What if we took the 'struggle for life' seriously again?", "url": "https://www.subanima.org/agency/", "text": "What if we took the 'struggle for life' seriously again?\n\nThis video has been a while in the making. I've been slowly building up to a video on agency through all the ones since the history of teleology in biology video here.\n\nIt seems this video is also pretty well timed with agency only becoming more and more of an interest to biologists. Currently, there are three big upcoming books which will feature plenty of discussion on agency by: Philip Ball, Kevin Mitchell and Yogi Jaeger.\n\nI'm very excited to read all three, but in the meantime if you want a good summary of the current state of thoughts on agency Philip released a brilliant review a few months back which I highly recommend.\n\nIt would pair well with Lynn Chiu's review of the extended evolutionary synthesis which I skirted around the corners of in the video, without mentioning it explictly.\n\nFor more in depth treatments of how to actually go about building theory from the concept of biological agency, I'd recommend the following:\n\nJaeger, J.

Darwin sees this struggle all throughout the natural world. Predators attacking their prey, a cactus desperately searching for water, ants venturing out of the colony to find and share food with each other.\n\nBut modern biology has largely forgotten this struggle and in its place we now think of life mechanistically. From lock-and-key mechanisms, motors, genetic programs, brains as computers, organisms as mere vehicles for genes or even \"gigantic lumbering robots \u2026 manipulated by remote control\u201d.\n\nXing, J., Bai, F., Berry, R., & Oster, G.

J. (2019). Is the cell really a machine?. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 477, 108-126. https://philpapers.org/archive/NICITC.pdf\n\nLife has gone from being a Darwinian struggle to being a mindless algorithm.\n\nMost biologists don\u2019t even think twice about machine-talk in biology. But they'll shudder if anyone ever mentions that organisms pursue their own goals like us humans. Somehow we've convinced ourselves that organisms are closer to dead things than alive things.\n\nWalsh, D. M. (2015). Organisms, agency, and evolution. Cambridge University Press, p. 188. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316402719\n\nWilkins, J. S., & Bourrat, P. (2001). Replication and reproduction. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/replication/\n\nIn this video, I\u2019d like to outline a positive case for an alternative way of thinking about life. What if we took the agency of organisms seriously? What kind of theory could we build out of biological purposes and intentions? Would it even be scientific?\n\nTo begin to explore what a theory of biological agency would look like, I think it'd be helpful to go back to one of the classical examples of evolution.\n\nWhen Charles Darwin visited the Galapag\u00f3s islands in the 1830s, he noticed that there were a range of finch species across the different islands. Some had larger, more robust beaks that could crack open hard seeds whilst others had more slender nimble beaks that could snatch up insects.\n\nStandard evolutionary theory explains that these different species must have come from a single population of finches that migrated to the islands long ago. The different environmental conditions on the islands then favoured certain birds to survive over others.\n\nOn an dry island with lots of hard seeds, birds with larger beaks would be more likely to crack them open and survive to pass on their big beak genes. Birds with smaller beaks wouldn't be able to eat the seeds and would therefore die off. Over many generations these differences would accumulate and we'd get the different species we see today.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the mechanistic driving force behind this process of natural selection was clarified through the field of population genetics and lots and lots of maths. On the one hand population genetics was a huge success and saw evolutionary biology coalesce into a coherent field of study. But on the other, it required abstracting away very far from the life biologists allegedly wanted to study. Organisms went from being the central unit of analysis, struggling for existence, to being passive vehicles for genes.\n\nWalsh, D. M. (2015). Organisms, agency, and evolution. Cambridge University Press, p. 23. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316402719\n\nModern evolutionary theory has added some bells and whistles to this picture allowing for things like ecological interactions, more complicated genetic mechanisms and developmental variation. But random mutations at the genetic level still remain the ultimate source of innovation.\n\nChiu, L. 2022. Extended Evolutionary Synthesis. A Review of the Latest Scientific Research. John Templeton Foundation. West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, USA. p. 4 10.15868/socialsector.40950\n\nWhat if we questioned that central assumption though? What if novelty at the behavioural level came first and the genetics followed after? Sounds pretty crazy right?\n\nTake these cockatoos in Sydney that have learnt how to open garbage bins. This complex behaviour has spread in recent years, much to the dismay of Sydney's residents. Researchers have managed to work out that this pretty funny behaviour has been spreading by cockatoos copying each other, not through the passing on of genes.\n\nKlump, B. C., Martin, J. M., Wild, S., H\u00f6rsch, J. K., Major, R. E., & Aplin, L. M. (2021). Innovation and geographic spread of a complex foraging culture in an urban parrot. Science, 373(6553), 456-460. 10.1126/science.abe7808\n\nSo this trait is more likely to have been acquired by exploratory learning, not from a bin-flipping mutation appearing in the population. Ecologist John Martin suspects that:\n\nThere were overfull bins, the birds started to somehow learn that there was free food in there, the cockatoos learned that, and then they figured out they could open the bins.\n\nCan it really be scientifically justified though to say that a cockatoo has the 'goal' of opening the bin to get at the food inside? Or are we relying on bird consciousness or invoking some kind of weird causality here?\n\nStandard causal explanations take the form of \u201cpresent event X causes future event Y\u201d (a neural circuit firing causes the cockatoo to open the bin). But in using the language of purposes we seem to be saying \u201cfuture event Y causes present event X.\u201d The cockatoo striving to eat the food inside the bin (a hypothetical future that hasn\u2019t happened yet) causes it to open the bin in the present. This seems pretty suspect involving some mystical force from the future.\n\nAllen, C. D. (2003). Teleological notions in biology. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleology-biology/\n\nWalsh, D. M. (2015). Organisms, agency, and evolution. Cambridge University Press, p. 189. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316402719\n\nOf course we can get around this if we appeal to consciousness and say that the bird has a mental model it has constructed around opening the bin. But that would restrict our theory of agency to things that have a brain. It wouldn\u2019t make any sense to say that a plant wants to grow its roots to find water, or that an immune cell wants to chase after a bacterium in order to keep it from infecting the body.\n\nWalsh, D. M. (2015). Organisms, agency, and evolution. Cambridge University Press, p. 189. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316402719\n\nDavid Rogers\n\nWe can resolve all of these issues if we think of goals as robust states that organisms tend towards. This makes goals perfectly empirical phenomena that we can observe in nature at all levels of life, similar to what mathematicians call stable attractors.\n\nWalsh, D. M. (2015). Organisms, agency, and evolution. Cambridge University Press, p. 200. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781316402719\n\nA seed in the right environment robustly tends towards becoming a mature plant. It might not always get there, but the tendency is definitely an observable regularity in nature. So then there\u2019s nothing spooky going on for me to say that the seed has the goal of becoming a mature plant. Biologists Jong Gwan Lee and Daniel McShea have even come up with a method to measure goal-directedness.\n\nLee, J. G., & McShea, D. W. (2020). Operationalizing goal directedness: an empirical route to advancing a philosophical discussion. Philosophy, Theory, and Practice in Biology, 12(005). https://doi.org/10.3998/ptpbio.16039257.0012.005\n\nAdmittedly, this conception of goal-directed activity is pretty broad. Stable attractors appear in all sorts of non-living dynamical systems. Like, we could end up saying that clouds have the goal of turning into rain which might seem pretty weird.\n\nPersonally, ascribing goals to non-living systems doesn't really bother me that much since we don't have, and may never get, a proper definition for life - see this video for more on that.\n\nPlus there are other ways of naturalising teleology that are more restrictive.\n\nBut putting those details aside, how does all this affect evolutionary theory? Well, rather than looking at organisms as passive objects pushed around by forces, we can see them as active agents that explore different behavioural strategies in order to survive.\n\nWalsh, D. M. (2018). Objectcy and agency: Towards a methodological vitalism. In Everything flows. Oxford University Press. p. 181-182. https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198779636.003.0008\n\nSo to understand evolution from this perspective of biological agency, we not only need to know what the environment affords the organism, but also its goals and abilities, as well as its capacity to learn.\n\nWalsh, D. M. (2018). Objectcy and agency: Towards a methodological vitalism. In Everything flows. Oxford University Press. p. 177. https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198779636.003.0008\n\nFor the case of bin-opening in cockatoos, there have to be:\n\nBins with food inside them, provided by the kind residents of Sydney,\n\nCockatoos to seek out the bins and open them in a goal-directed manner, and,\n\nCockatoos able to learn the behaviour through social copying and experimentation.\n\nAn organism\u2019s behaviour can also shape its landscape of environmental affordances in the first place. Bacteria in a petri dish might produce byproducts that other strains of bacteria can consume. And trees can release nutrients into the soil which attracts fungi to come in and provide water and minerals to the plant.\n\nSan Roman, M., & Wagner, A. (2018). An enormous potential for niche construction through bacterial cross-feeding in a homogeneous environment.

John Templeton Foundation. West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, USA. p. 34 10.15868/socialsector.40950\n\nFor our cockatoos, the bin-opening has caused Sydney-siders to put things like water bottles, brooms and bricks on top of the bins to stop the birds from opening them. But then the cycle of agency just repeats with the cockatoos working out how to overcome the pesky human inventions.\n\nKlump, B. C., Major, R. E., Farine, D. R., Martin, J. M., & Aplin, L. M. (2022). Is bin-opening in cockatoos leading to an innovation arms race with humans?. Current Biology, 32(17), R910-R911. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.08.008\n\nDoes any of this really have an effect on evolution in the long term though? I mean it's nice to think of the ecological webs that organisms exist in, but surely all we have to care about in the long term are changes in gene frequencies right?\n\nHere's where things get even weirder.\n\nIn one of my favourite experiments in biology, Conrad Hal Waddington, demonstrated that the gene's first view of evolution couldn't be the whole story. Waddington took a whole bunch of fruit fly larvae and exposed them to ether vapour. While most still developed normally, some of the larvae developed a second thorax and four wings instead of the usual two.\n\nHe then took the ones that had this trait, bred them together and exposed their offspring to the same ether vapour. After repeating this process for 20 generations, Waddington discovered that the flies would now develop double thoraxes without needing the vapour.\n\nHow could this possibly work? Well, Waddington developed the concept of genetic assimilation to explain his results and to understand that, we'll need to go to Waddington's landscape which I talked about in detail in this video.\n\nIn this model of how your genetics work, genes are these paddles in the middle, the bins at the bottom are different traits like a single or a double thorax and the ball falling represents the process of development from single celled embryo to adult.\n\nUnder normal environmental conditions, the fly's development will tend to end up in the single thorax bin. But when exposed to the vapour, it's like the ball has been nudged onto a different part of the landscape making it land in a different bin.\n\nWaddington theorised that across many generations, the landscape or the developmental system as a whole would shift to accommodate this change, if it kept on happening, and was also a useful adaptation. This could happen by standard natural selection at the genetic level. But importantly, this selection was only made possible by the initial nudge of the environmental factor.\n\nNishikawa, K., & Kinjo, A. R. (2018). Mechanism of evolution by genetic assimilation: Equivalence and independence of genetic mutation and epigenetic modulation in phenotypic expression. Biophysical reviews, 10(2), 667-676. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12551-018-0403-x\n\nOnce natural selection has done its thing over many generations, eventually you wouldn't need this initial bump any more to end up in this new part of the landscape. It would just happen naturally and at this point the trait has been assimilated into the genome.\n\nWaddington, C. H. (1957). The strategy of the genes (p. 167). Routledge. Link\n\nAlthough initially controversial, Waddington's theory of genetic assimilation has been largely vindicated by a number of examples from snakes on islands in Australia to caterpillars and bacteria. Environmentally induced traits really can cause long lasting genetic changes.\n\nAubret, F., & Shine, R. (2009).

On each of the different islands there are a range of potential food sources that the birds haven't seen before. Rather than blind natural selection filtering out different birds, the finches themselves now begin to bring about their own evolution. They start to experiment: some use twigs to get bugs out of tree holes, some manage to eat the flowers that grow on the island's cactuses, some peck sea birds and work out they can drink their blood like vampires and some crack open eggs twice their bodyweight.\n\nTebbich, S., Sterelny, K., & Teschke, I.

Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 365(1543), 1099-1109. https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2009.0291\n\nThe struggle for existence causes them to explore their new environments in all sorts of new ways - not random genetic mutations. The birds on each of the different islands eventually settle on different strategies and goals as time goes on, and over many generations, these behaviours become assimilated genetically.\n\nChiu, L. 2022.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 102(suppl_1), 6543-6549. 10.1073/pnas.0501844102\n\nFrom this perspective, the diversity among the finch species is a direct consequence of the incredible flexibility and curiosity of these birds. This explains why they diversified, while other less flexible bird species that also migrated to the islands didn't.\n\nTebbich, S., Sterelny, K., & Teschke, I. (2010).

But it, together with this whole agential perspective does give us a heap of interesting questions to ask like: how exactly can we measure behavioural innovation? How do organisms recognise and learn about environmental affordances? Where do goals come from? What entities can have goals? And perhaps the biggest question, how does true organismic agency impact evolutionary change?\n\nBrown, R. L. (2022). Mapping Out the Landscape: A Multi-dimensional Approach to Behavioral Innovation.

If I were to name one plant that has my heart, it would be this one.

String of Pearls is a creeping succulent that has green balls for leaves (they look like peas)!\n\nIn this post, I am going to share some tips on caring for a string of pearls. I will also share some other species of this plant family at the end of the post.\n\nRelated: Love plants?

You will need some well-draining succulent soil mix, which you can buy at most garden centers. It has a mix of soil and sand.\n\nThe sand helps aid in soil aeration and lets the water flow more freely through the soil. I also like to put some extra perlite in my succulent soil.\n\nPerlite is found in nature and is actually formed by volcanic eruptions. Perlite is great for helping your soil drain the water out faster, as well.\n\nFor pots, get one that is about the same size (definitely not smaller) or a tiny bit bigger than the plastic pot that it came in (it will likely come in a plastic hanging basket). I like to use a terracotta pot or an earthenware pot.\n\nThe most important aspect when choosing a pot is that it must have a drainage hole so the water has a way of escaping. If the water cannot escape the pot, then there is a good chance the plant could die due to being waterlogged.\n\nNext, mix up your soil with a couple of scoops of perlite and have it ready to go. Take your pot and put a little soil in the bottom.\n\nNext, carefully remove your string of pearls from the pot by gently placing your hand on top of the plant, slightly wiggle the pot until the plant pops out.\n\nYou might lose a few pearls (leaves) in this process, but that\u2019s OK! Place your plant in the pot and make sure the plant sits about even with the pot\u2019s rim. I put the roots about 1 centimeter under the rim and the pearls are all on top of the rim.\n\nDon\u2019t let the plant lay lower than the pot\u2019s rim because water can pool on top of the leaves.\n\nThe plant loves to drink up light and trail over the edge of the pot. Once you have the crown of the plant placed correctly, take the extra dirt and backfill around the plant. I like using a chopstick to push down the dirt around the plant.\n\nOnce you\u2019re done backfilling the dirt, the string or pearls will likely need untangling (especially if you have a long one). Be patient during this process. If I slightly tug on a stem it could snap!\n\nCarefully look for a whole stem and gently untangle it so it lays draping over the pot. I go around the whole plant until all stems are untangled. You will probably lose a few more pearls during this process too, but it\u2019s OK!\n\nNote: Even though this plant has lots of amazing qualities, string of pearls plants are toxic for humans and pets if ingested. If a bead (leaf) falls off a stem onto the floor, then I will quickly pick it up so my dog does not eat them.\n\nLight\n\nThe string of pearls likes a bright and sunny environment in your home. An east or west facing window will work great. I place mine right near a window so they can drink up lots of light.\n\nTry to avoid placing it near any vents or drafty parts of your home (near a door opening up in the winter, etc.). It will not like any kind of extreme air temperatures blowing on it. During the warmer summer months, you can also put it under a sun porch or covered porch to soak up bright indirect light.\n\nDirect sunlight could burn your plant, so try to avoid it sitting in the sun for hours on end or they will get scorched. When temps begin to drop, bring your plant indoors.\n\nBefore you bring it indoors, always check for pests or bugs. When I was bringing in my succulents from our covered porch at the end of summer, I found a baby black widow hiding under a leaf. This has happened to me again a couple of years later!\n\nMy lesson was learned quickly so thoroughly inspect any plant before you bring it back into your home.\n\nWatering\n\nFiguring out a watering routine and getting to know your plant\u2019s schedule will really pay off. String of pearls do not like to get soaked or sit in water for long periods of time. I like to say that I \u201cmoisten\u201d my string of pearls instead of watering them.\n\nThis helps remind me that they don\u2019t need excessive water. The plant has a shallow root system, so generally the top half of my string of pearls pot needs water. I use a small vessel with water in it and lightly water over the whole top of the plant.\n\nOverwatering the string of pearls will be the biggest killer to your plant. You can tell if a plant is overwatered by the leaves looking squishy or they lose their deep green color and become a bit translucent and soft.\n\nIf you are shopping for a new string of pearls, be mindful of this. You\u2019ll want a plant with deep green pearls and soil that is not waterlogged.\n\nNot sure when to water your string of pearls? It really depends on where you live and humidity levels. Dryer climates will require more water and vice versa.\n\nYou can test the soil by sticking your finger in a part of the soil to check moisture levels or lift your pot to see if it has any weight from holding water.\n\nMake sure your water temp is lukewarm to cool (think of rainwater temp). The string of pearls will not tolerate extreme cold or hot temps when watering.\n\nThey love to be watered frequently in the spring and summer months (during its growing season), but back off on frequent watering in the fall/winter months. The string of pearls likes to dry out but not be bone dry.\n\nHow can you tell when it is bone dry? The dirt around the circumference of the pot will pull away from the pot. If this has happened, no worries, give it a watering and try to water your plant sooner next time to avoid the dirt drying out too much.\n\nIf this happened multiple times, it could affect your leaves and plant\u2019s root health. Another aspect of root health is root rot. This can be detrimental to your plant.\n\nRoot rot happens when the roots stand in water too long and they eventually rot and die. It can be a very sad and slow death for a string of pearls.\n\nIf you suspect that your plant has been sitting in water for too long and it might have root rot, pull it out of the pot to inspect the roots. If the roots are firm and grayish white, that is great. If they are mushy and look blackish, then your plant likely has root rot.\n\nIf it\u2019s not too far gone, you can try to snip the dead roots off and leave the healthy, firm ones. Placing the plant in fresh (not waterlogged soil) will help as well.\n\nWhat is the best kind of water to use? If you are using tap/city water, you can leave your tap water out in an open container for 24 hours so some of the chemicals evaporate. After 24 hours, the water is cleaner and healthier for your plant!\n\nFluoride and chlorine can build up in your string of pearls root system, so this method of leaving your water out will pay off in the long run. Using filtered water or collected rain water (if you can) is a great option, too!\n\nIf you have well water, then your plant will love that. My friends who have well water have THE best plants.\n\nPropagating\n\nYou can propagate the string of pearls three ways! The first way is by using water. First, find a healthy stem. I like to use stems that are at least 4-5 inches.\n\nUsing clean scissors or cutting shears, cut your stem. Remove any beads about 1.5-2 inches from the bottom of the cutting.\n\nLeave the stem laying out for 24 hours so the fresh cut on the end of the stem can form a callus. Make sure it stays out of any sunlight during this healing period.\n\nAfter 24 hours, place your fresh cutting in water. The side of the cutting with the removed leafs can be placed in the water. Keep the remaining pearls above the water line.\n\nBe sure to change water anytime it gets cloudy and rinse out your vessel. Place in a sunny spot in your home. After 3-4 weeks you should see little roots sprouting from the cutting!\n\nWait until the roots are at least 1 inch long before you plant it in dirt. Once it is ready to be potted, use a small terra-cotta or clay pot with good draining cactus/succulent soil.\n\nI like to use a chopstick to create little holes for the newly rooted plant. Moisten lightly and your plant should start growing.\n\nThe next way to propagate is by using dirt. Using the same methods as above, you will snip your plant, wait 24 hours, and instead of placing it in water, place your plant in soil (well draining, succulent soil).\n\nUse a chopstick (or pencil) to create a fresh hole for your new cutting, tuck the dirt around the plant. I like to mist my plant to keep the soil slightly moist and not bone dry.\n\nAfter about three weeks, I give the plant a very gentle tug to see if it is rooting. If the new cutting stays in place, then I know new roots are forming. This is always exciting! If your plant has started to form roots, then it is ready for a watering.\n\nAnother way to propagate your string of pearls is by layering. I find this approach to be the most effective. Take a fresh pot of succulent soil, mist it, and then take a good long cutting from your string of pearls. Swirl or coil the cutting over the top of the dirt on the pot.\n\nFertilizing\n\nI like to fertilize my plant once a month during the growing season (spring and summer) using a balanced fertilizer. I use half of the manufacturer\u2019s recommended rate when I mix my fertilizer.\n\nI love liquid fertilizer because it mixes so easily with the water and I don\u2019t have to worry about it not being evenly distributed in my plants.\n\nOne thing I love about this species of plant is the different varieties. Pictured above is \u201cString of Turtles\u201d\u2014the turtles look like little turtles backs. \u201cString of Watermelons\u201d are plump and their leaves resemble a watermelon (pictured below).\n\nAren\u2019t they unique and whimsical?

At 3:00 p.m., a fresh-faced audience has gathered in the garden, chatting as they await that afternoon\u2019s act: a jazz and R&B fusion act dubbed the Sonic Messenger Quintet. As headliner DJ AceMoma occupies a sound booth level with the crowd, it\u2019s easy to forget that just a few months ago, the music-filled greenhouse was an empty asphalt lot.\n\nDirectly adjacent to where The Nursery is now situated is Public Records \u2013 an all-in-one vegan restaurant, cocktail lounge and music venue housed in what was formerly the ASPCA headquarters. Since 2019, the nearly 10,000-square-foot industrial-inspired building in Gowanus has quickly established itself as a cultural hub for its diverse music programming and the platform it provides to independent musicians, from jazz acts to house music DJs.\n\nThree years later, Public Records founders Shane Davis and Francis Harris began ideating how to make use of the asphalt lot next to Public Records\u2019 garden and provide a new social space, particularly one designed with the local community in mind. When it opened this past May, The Nursery, similar to the amorphous identity of Public Records, marked not only a radical transformation of the lot itself but a complete overhaul of what one would expect a club to look like.\n\nDavis, who handles design and creative direction, tells Hypebeast that designing The Nursery \u2014 a vast, airy space filled with plants \u2014 was \u201cinformed by a necessity of temporality.\u201d\n\nIn charting out their plans for The Nursery, the duo says that the central focus was to use the lot as a functional plant nursery. Davis and Harris, having been informed by their experience with Public Records the first time around, knew they would be bound to some of the rules and regulations of building in New York, hence the need for a temporal space.\n\n\u201cThe foundation of The Nursery is to serve this double function as an actual plant nursery for our collection of plants in the winter and as a gathering space,\u201d Davis says. \u201cAs we kind of dove deeper into it and explored the possibilities for this site, it started iterating into something that was more dynamic and multifaceted.\u201d\n\n1 of 3 2 of 3 3 of 3\n\nDavis and Harris tapped Mattaforma, a New York-based architecture firm that draws on environmental research, to help design a structure that would be easily reconfigurable and generate a minimal amount of waste during its construction. A U-shaped greenhouse with heating and cooling capabilities was formed out of three shipping containers, dimensional timber and polycarbonate. From start to finish, the construction took place without the use of any heavy machinery. Not only will The Nursery be converted into an insular greenhouse to protect the plants during the winter months, but it\u2019ll additionally provide a private dining room for patrons of Public Records\u2019 restaurant.\n\nOJAS and NNNN, two independent audio brands, were brought in to assemble The Nursery\u2019s sound system, while the Los Angeles plant studio Cactus Store curated the landscape design. Brooklyn-based firm Space Exploration helmed the interior design of the utilitarian DJ booth, drawing inspiration from the shipping container that houses it.\n\nFrom ecology to acoustics, a driving force behind each decision made during The Nursery\u2019s build was that function was first \u2014 and form was second.. \u201cThe architecture that composes the planters and the benches may look normal but they\u2019re all highly absorbent surfaces, so those function to treat sound,\u201d says Davis. \u201cEven the bamboo, which envelops the space, has certain sound absorbing properties.\u201d\n\nEven prior to its launch, The Nursery had a built-in audience thanks to the cult following that Public Records has accrued over the past few years, but it\u2019s also had its fair share of newcomers \u2013 myself among them \u2013 join the ranks. Beyond the drinks, food and unparalleled vibe, Harris, who leads music programming, says Public Records is \u201cgrounded in the music.\u201d While it remains to be seen exactly how the space will be converted come winter, presently, The Nursery acts as a host to Sunday Series, a weekly day party boasting an eclectic roster of acts each week, many of whom originally held residences at Public Records\u2019 main Sound Room.\n\nCompared to the Sound Room and UPSTAIRS lounge, Harris describes the Sunday Series as being more geared towards the local community, not merely those who like to hit the club.\n\n\u201cSunday series is a little bit more of an outside like breezy, cool vibe,\u201d Harris says. \u201cA family can show up and hang out or an older couple from the neighborhood can roll through.\u201d\n\n1 of 2 2 of 2\n\n\u201cIt definitely differs from what we would do with the Sound Room, which is a little bit younger, and the lounge being more for archival music. We have to think of these different spaces in different ways from a curatorial standpoint.\u201d\n\nAlthough The Nursery is an offshoot of Public Records, it\u2019s a standalone gem in its own right. Davis and Harris have cultivated a particularly unique space unlike any other music venue in Brooklyn or New York City for that matter. The Nursery is unpolished, unpretentious and provides a thoughtful solution to the typical waste involved in building \u2013 and eventually dismantling \u2013 urban infrastructure, combined with a meticulously curated lineup of artists that always delivers.\n\nThis weekend, The Nursery will emanate the sounds of West Coast house, welcoming Vancouver\u2019s D.DEE and Oakland\u2019s Space Ghost. For the ensuing weekends, Davis and Harris have already queued up a stacked calendar of musical offerings across genres. Throughout the summer and in the months thereafter, The Nursery, still in its infancy, will continue to evolve.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1171, "llama_token_count": 1418}, {"source_name": "PetaPixel", "author": "Matt Growcoot", "title": "Meta Claims to Have Built an Unrivaled AI Image Generator", "description": "Facebook's owner Meta claims to have built a state-of-the-art AI image generator that requires less computational power and needs less training data that the models currently on the market.\n[Read More]", "url": "https://petapixel.com/2023/07/19/meta-claims-to-have-built-an-unrivaled-ai-image-generator/", "text": "Facebook\u2019s owner Meta claims to have built a state-of-the-art AI image generator that requires less computational power and needs less training data that the models currently on the market.\n\nCalled CM3Leon (pronounced chameleon), it shuns the diffusion model used by DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney that creates an image by adding Gaussian noise and then subtracting it into a (sometimes) coherent image.\n\nInstead, CM3Leon is a transformer model that uses a process called \u201cattention\u201d which judges the relevance of input data.

Last year, the band released Bleed Out, an LP inspired by action movies, and it was fucking awesome. Today, they\u2019ve announced plans to follow that one with something that might be even more exciting: A sequel to their beloved 2002 classic All Hail West Texas.\n\nAll Hail West Texas was the last album that the Mountain Goats released when the band was really just John Darnielle and his boombox. It\u2019s full of vivid, powerful stories that Darnielle sketches out in a few words, and it remains one of the best records in a huge catalog. The new LP Jenny From Thebes is dedicated to Jenny, the character introduced in the All Hail West Texas song of the same name. (She\u2019s made a few appearances on Mountain Goats songs since then.) Sonically, Jenny From Thebes stands in stark opposition to All Hail West Texas. In a press release, Darnielle says, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do a sequel to a record that was recorded almost entirely on a boombox, why not do the opposite and make it as big as possible?\u201d\n\nThe Mountain Goats recorded Jenny From Thebes with Sheryl Crow collaborator Trina Shoemaker. Bully\u2019s Alicia Bognanno, who produced Bleed Out, plays guitar on the album, while Matt Douglas adds horn and string arrangement. Matt Nathanson and the Go-Go\u2019s\u2019 Kathy Valentine sing backup. Lead single \u201cClean Slate\u201d is a lush, expansive chug that has a gorgeous Motown-style sheen working for it, and Darnielle sounds smoother than I\u2019ve ever heard him. The lyrics paint a picture of a house full of vagrants. This shit rules!\n\nHere\u2019s what Darnielle has to say for himself:\n\nWe\u2019re proud to reveal \u201cClean Slate,\u201d the first song from our new album Jenny From Thebes. People like to hedge bets by using terms like \u201cconcept album\u201d but let\u2019s be clear, this is a rock opera about a woman named Jenny, who buys a Kawasaki to ride as far away as she can from a town she\u2019s been carrying on her shoulders too long. \u201cClean Slate\u201d sets the scene: This is the house Jenny rents; these are the people who crash there when they need a place to stay; this is where she\u2019s at in the process of becoming someone other than the keyholder she\u2019s been. Produced by Trina Shoemaker! Played by the Mountain Goats at the Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma!

Everything from the record's high-profile debut at the Pyramids to its accompanying A24 movie has suffered from stop-start launches and sudden turnarounds.\n\nThe confusing antics aren't atypical for a hyped album \u2014 remember Kanye \"Ye\" West's exhausting Donda premieres? \u2014 admittedly, but that doesn't make 'em any less baffling.\n\nCase in point, Travis Scott published a poster for his Utopia movie, Circus Maximus on July 25. In tiny text towards the bottom, you can see a \"Produced by A24\" credit that's apparently bogus.\n\nIt's especially bizarre because Scott really was working with A24 on a then-enigmatic Utopia script, or so he said back in August 2021.\n\nAt the time, industry trade Variety announced that Scott's Cactus Jack imprint had signed a production deal with A24 as part of a multi-movie deal.\n\nScott's Circus Maximus poster reveals the A24 credit, the film's name, Utopia branding, and a release date (July 27) that precedes July 28, the date that Scott was set to premiere Utopia in front of Giza's Great Pyramids. Even that event is kind of a mess, but more on that later.\n\nAnyways, following the poster reveal, it was widely reported that Scott's Circus Maximus movie would see theatrical release, boasting the talents of multiple well-regarded art directors, including Harmony Korine (Gummo), Gaspar No\u00e9 (Enter the Void), and Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive). Scott himself was given the top credit, though.\n\nDespite the \"Produced By A24\" credit on the poster and Cactus Jack's reported A24 deal, however, the buzzy production company is reportedly not involved with Circus Maximus at all, according to what A24 itself said in a statement.\n\nSo, who actually helped fund and create Scott's Utopia movie? Will anyone correct Circus Maximus' poster gaffe? Who's putting it in theaters?\n\nSounds like no one will know until they see the movie IRL, which they can do at one of several hundred American AMC theaters listed on Scott's Utopia website (fans can also buy tickets in advance).\n\nScott's A24 flap smacks of the recent Drake-Vogue drama, wherein the Canadian rapper attached himself to an established brand for the sake of borrowing inherent prestige, though there was no actual partnership.\n\nIt's not impossible to imagine that A24 actually had something to do with Scott's movie earlier in the production cycle and that the pair apparently separated early enough that A24 has nothing to do with Circus Maximus as it stands. That's all speculation, though.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Travis Scott's buzzy Utopia launch party in front of the Pyramids of Giza is its own separate incident.\n\nScott's event was announced in mid-July, then apparently canceled by Egypt itself after Scott was accused of Freemasonry (!?), then it was uncanceled, maybe. Now, it's actually canceled.\n\nScott's management and promoters previously asserted that the Utopia concert remained underway and Livenation was still selling tickets up until July 26 so it seems like the concert at the Pyramids was a last-minute cancellation.\n\nNot such a Utopia, after all.", "tiktoken_token_count": 701, "llama_token_count": 872}, {"source_name": "Thedailyupside.com", "author": "newsfeedback@fool.com (The Daily Upside)", "title": "Google's AI programmer", "description": "In its fight to remain relevant in AI, Google may be adding a multi-tool to its arsenal.

Essentially, this tool watches a programmer write code and makes suggestions for edits or tools that will help them in real time, based on what the programmer is intending to do.\n\nUsing machine learning, Google\u2019s system tracks the changes a programmer is making to source code. If the programmer makes certain changes repeatedly, such as changing one variable or function over and over again, the system will determine that they intend to make those changes throughout. The system then takes into account repositories of source code transformations and tools made by other programmers to find the best fit for the job.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a coder, think of it like this: Imagine you\u2019re building a table and aren\u2019t sure which tool from a massive toolkit is best fit to tighten a bunch of tiny screws throughout it. A tool like Google\u2019s might suggest that you use a power drill, instead of a screw driver, to expedite the process.\n\nGoogle said in its filing that this tech can automate the tedious, repetitive tasks that often come with coding. While macros can often be individually created to automate repetitive tasks, creating those tools themselves \u201ccan be cumbersome and/or require considerable expertise/resources,\u201d the company noted.\n\nPlus, Google noted, \u201cmany such tools may not scale outside of a particular context.\u201d Its tool fills this gap, acting as a jack of all trades.\n\nPhoto via the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nGoogle adding another piece to its hoard of AI tech is about as surprising as a cactus growing in the desert. The company has been touting new AI tools on the horizon for several months, including AI integrations throughout the Google Workspace suite, enhancing its search engine with AI, and merged its two major AI divisions, DeepMind and the Brain Team, into a single supergroup. And with practically the entire internet at its disposal for training data (at least according to its privacy policy update), the company shows no signs of stopping.\n\nThis patent in particular adds to previous filings showing Google\u2019s interest in AI-assisted development. The company recently sought to patent a machine learning model that can create a user interface, and an AI tool that can develop and publish a \u201cviable running app,\u201d both from natural language descriptions. Though the tech in the latest patent would likely be put to use by programmers, while the others would be for a no-code crowd, these filings all together could hint at a suite of AI-based development tools in the works.\n\nBut Google faces some steep competition, said Kevin Gordon, co-founder of AI consulting and development firm Velora Labs. AI-assisted coding products already exist in the market, and more are likely to come, especially from competitors like Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI, Gordon said. Microsoft, for example, owns GitHub, which operates an AI coding assistant called GitHub Copilot. Meanwhile, OpenAI launched Code Interpreter earlier this month.\n\nGordon wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this tech and others like it end up being fought out in court, he said. \u201cThe legal side is probably where you\u2019ll see a lot of the actual battles taking place. Patents like this will be important to defend the play.\u201d\n\nBut if Google\u2019s tech does reach developers hands at some point, Gordon can \u201cdefinitely see it being a big deal,\u201d he said. A large language model that can keep track of the minutiae across software repositories will likely do a better job at it than even an incredibly skilled programmer, he said. Adding a tool like this as a co-pilot for programming teams could allow for faster software development with less of a headache.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the people who have that 10,000 foot view of a repository, and then there\u2019s the people who are really detailed,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cHere, you have a (large language model) that can kind of work at both levels.\u201d\n\nHave any comments, tips or suggestions?

(Hopefully, some Bourdieu.) It turns out that defining the Democrat Party is, in fact, a hard problem. I do think the paragraph that follows is on point all the way back to 2016, if not before: The Democrat Party is the political expression of the class power of PMC, their base (lucidly explained by Thomas Frank in Listen, Liberal!). It follows that the Democrat Party is as \u201cunreformable\u201d as the PMC is unreformable ; if the Democrat Party did not exist, the PMC would have to invent it. If the Democrat Party fails to govern, that\u2019s because the PMC lacks the capability to govern . (\u201cPMC\u201d modulo \u201cclass expatriates,\u201d of course.)

Some doctors may refuse to mask because they believe that such a requirement violates their political beliefs, regardless of science. Others may simply believe that the \u201cdiscomfort\u201d of a mask is beneath them. If patients persist in asking their doctors to mask after an initial refusal, care may be discontinued, on the grounds that the physician-patient relationship has broken down. A notice that care will be discontinued must be provided within a reasonable time so that a patient can transfer care without any treatment interruption. In practice, \u201creasonable time\u201d often means 30 days. Given nationwide physician shortages, a 30-day notice is generally insufficient to transfer care seamlessly. Many offices will not schedule a new patient appointment without first receiving a referral or medical records, which also take time to obtain. A 2022 survey of physician offices in 15 major metropolitan areas found that the average wait time to see, for example, a cardiologist, was 26.6 days. The possibility of discontinuation of care becomes a threat intended to ensure patient obedience.\u201d More: \u201cEnforcing a health care provider\u2019s duty to mask should not be left to patients. Masking is an inherently charged subject with the potential to create tension in the patient-physician relationship. That conflict may compromise quality of care or create or exacerbate a patient\u2019s medical trauma. High-risk patients with disabilities have suffered enough.\u201d \u2022 Worth reading in full.\n\nCovid is Airborne\n\n\u201cClearing the Air on Air Changes per Hour: Time to Move On\u201d [Joey Fox, It\u2019s Airborne]. \u201cAir changes per hour is not a meaningful value when assessing the concentration of pollutants. Its use when describing air cleaning equipment or recommended air cleaning rates is only relevant in a room with a specific volume and is not generalizable. Any use of it should be approached with suspicion. It can make small spaces appear to be low risk and very large spaces appear to be high risk, when the opposite is true. To assess the risk of a situation, a more appropriate metric, like airflow rate per person should be used, depending on the pollutant.\u201d \u2022 Hmm. But the number of people in a room cannot be determined in advance. What am I missing here?\n\nSequelae\n\n\u201cLong COVID Is Disabling Kids.

[I]t seems likely that at least some children and young adults who contract COVID-19 suffer persistent neurological damage. Quite apart from the loneliness of school closures and the inadequacy of Zoom lessons, a substantial portion of the student-age population is dealing with COVID-induced impaired cognition, memory loss, anxiety and depression\u2026. The chances of developing long COVID, complete with neurological damage, increase with reinfection. That means some percentage of the present cohort of students will be lost every week, every month, every year. Whatever they might have achieved without infection, their achievements will be hobbled, perhaps for life, by long COVID. At the same time, those who might address the problem are themselves dealing with it.\u201d \u201cFirst major survey of doctors with Long Covid reveals debilitating impact on health, life and work\u201d (press release) [BMA]. \u201cAround 60% of doctors told the BMA that post-acute Covid ill health has impacted on their ability to carry out day-to-day activities on a regular basis; Almost one in five respondents (18%) reported that they were now unable to work due to their post-acute Covid ill-health; Less than one in three (31%) doctors said they were working full-time, compared to more than half (57%) before the onset of their illness; Nearly half (48%) said they have experienced some form of loss of earnings as a result of post-acute Covid.\u201d \u2022 Yikes. \u201cPossible cancer-causing capacity of COVID-19: Is SARS-CoV-2 an oncogenic agent?\u201d [Biochimie]. \u201c[T]he cancer-related effects of SARS-CoV-2 proposed in this article are based on the ability of the virus and its proteins to cause cancer but that the long-term consequences of this infection will only be illustrated in the long run.\u201d Something to look forward to!

It\u2019s not clear that Ruth Handler \u2014 a business executive on vacation from her home in California \u2014 knew what Lilli was. It\u2019s not even clear among historians where the shop was: the popular Franz Carl Weber toy shop in Lucerne, a tobacco store or a bar. Regardless, Lilli did what she was designed for.

The Houston rapper\u2019s fourth album, Utopia, comes out July 28, and he announced that it will be released alongside a companion film, titled Circus Maximus. In true Travis Scott fashion, the movie won\u2019t have one director, but is instead the product of a seemingly unwieldy collaboration. The film will incorporate six different directors, starting with Scott himself, alongside names like Harmony Korine, Gaspar No\u00e9, Nicolas Winding-Refn, and Kahlil Joseph.\n\n\u201cPrepare to enter Circus Maximus as Travis Scott takes his audience on a mind-bending visual odyssey across the globe, woven together by the speaker rattling sounds of his highly anticipated upcoming album Utopia,\u201d reads the official synopsis from AMC Theaters. \u201cThe film is a surreal and psychedelic journey, uniting a collective of visionary filmmakers from around the world in a kaleidoscopic exploration of human experience and the power of soundscapes.\u201d\n\nDespite Cactus Jack agreeing to a production deal with A24 back in August 2021 and the company\u2019s logo appearing on a poster, A24 told Variety they are not involved in Circus Maximus. Back in 2021, Scott posted a picture of the script\u2019s first draft on his Instagram, which featured several references to A24 on the cover page.\n\nSomewhat confusingly, news of Circus Maximus was solidified the same day it was reported that Scott would star in a separate Harmony Korine film project, Aggro Dr1ft, which is premiering out-of-competition at the Venice International Film Festival. Korine shot the cover of Scott\u2019s Jackboys compilation, which invoked the director\u2019s beloved Spring Breakers with its neon green ski masks. It\u2019s unclear whether Circus Maximus will be a series of interconnected music videos (like Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade, which Joseph worked on), a non-musical anthology, a single narrative project featuring multiple directors, or something else entirely.\n\nScott shared a trailer via social media on July 25, featuring evocative images of the rapper performing, Renaissance paintings, and high-speed car chases, though it contained little in the way of actual plot details.

Why should we consider vegan psychology a specialized field?", "url": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/zooeyia/202204/vegans-suffer-from-stigma", "text": "Vegan psychology focuses on the specific psychological needs and stressors of people who identify as vegan, including the psychological effects of the stigmatization of vegan people. For clarification, a person who is vegan does not consume nor use any animal products. Vegans, in general, try to stay away from anything that uses, abuses, or oppresses other animals in order to benefit humans. Often, this includes a plant-based diet and a focus on sustainable practices such as forgoing wool or leather products and instead using alternative materials such as hemp, cotton, or newer materials such as \"cactus leather\" or \"pi\u00f1atex\". Despite public perception, it can be incredibly difficult to be vegan in a society that marginalizes ethical, rather than religious, belief systems such as veganism.\n\nSource: Unsplash with Getty\n\nThe Vegan Stigma\n\nPeople who identify as vegan are often severely stigmatized and may find themselves rejected by mainstream society. Despite a rise in vegan-identifying celebrities (Joaquin Phoenix, Woody Harrelson, Jessica Chastain), people often have stereotypical ideas about what a vegan looks like and how a vegan should act. When I asked my class of graduate students who they picture when I say the word \"vegan\", they said \"a young, white woman, a hippie, with great skin who is middle-to-upper class but she is always feeling angry.\" So, we started breaking down these stereotypes, one by one.\n\nWe discussed vegans of color, such as Erykah Badu, Congressman Corey Booker, boxer Mike Tyson, and singer Ne-Yo, and the rise of veganism in Latinx communities. We talked about the different reasons that someone becomes vegan\u2014for the animals, for health, or for the environment. (Methane gas produced from livestock is a notorious contributor to the deterioration of the ozone layer. Some experts suggest that if we eliminate animal agriculture, we may have a chance to reverse climate change). We discussed the economic stereotypes of veganism and discussed that rice and beans, pasta, potatoes, and frozen vegetables are low-cost non-animal products; in fact, in most developing countries people tend to eat a more heavily plant-based diet since meat can be more expensive than growing crops. And we discussed the alleged health benefits of veganism. Although a whole-foods, plant-based diet certainly is healthy, veganism is not in itself healthy, since processed food such as Oreo Cookies and Impossible Burgers may be only slightly healthier than their animal product equivalents.\n\n\"Angry Vegans\"\n\nMost importantly, we talked about the myth of the \"angry vegan\". The term \"plant-based\" is almost more acceptable than \"vegan\" since the word \"vegan\" often brings to mind someone with a fervor and ardor for changing public view\u2014usually through aggressive and sometimes militant means. There definitely are some extremist and angry vegans. This is a small subset of people and, although I don\u2019t agree with their approach, I understand why they are extreme. They see injustice in the world and are trying to be strong advocates for change. In my opinion, anger only turns people away and education, compassion, and kindness are stronger motivators for change. The vast majority of vegans promote compassion to all, including other humans, rather than anger. In our modern society, we have learned to not stereotype large groups of people by the actions of a few and yet we continue to judge vegans who just want to enjoy their lentil-based shepherd's pie in peace, based on the behavior of a few extremists.\n\nSource: Dr. Katherine Compitus\n\nMy 82-year-old father, who became vegan at 70 years old after reading about the health benefits, finds this stereotype particularly funny. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in changing anyone else\u2019s mind\u201d, says Norman Gross, now 82 years old. \u201cI read The China Study and the World Health Organization (WHO) reports on animal products. I\u2019m not interested in changing the opinions of others, I just want to live a long healthy life.\u201d (The China Study is a book by Campbell and Campell that describes how eating animal-products may be associated with cancer in humans). \"People simply don\u2019t want to change their minds,\" my dad said. \"Change is hard and menu options can be limited. I don\u2019t want to change my beliefs but I shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice my health just because a restaurant doesn\u2019t want to cook more vegetables.\u201d He continues, \"I don't think anger is the way to change. Education is key and we should be able to have difficult conversations to initiate change.\"\n\nI agree with my dad that change is hard for most people. I just read in the news about a famous chef who banned vegans from his restaurant because he doesn\u2019t feel like accommodating their needs. Personally, I have a severe tree-nut allergy and people are so careful with that, perhaps because we live in such a litigious society. Norman grew up Kosher and notes how quick people are to help out when a food isn't kosher or halal, but instead of respecting his vegan ethics, they often try to talk him out of it. As a society, we have learned to be respectful of organized religious beliefs, but oftentimes there is a lack of respect for deeply spiritual or ethically-held beliefs that are not manualized.\n\nIn his book Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe, Greg M. Epstein, Humanist Chaplain at Harvard University, wrote, \u201cThose of us who don\u2019t want to worship an invisible being or spend our days fretting about punishment in Hades do want to be able to share what we hold dear with our families and the broader world, and we want to be understood and appreciated for who we are.\u201d I believe that just because vegan ethics are morally driven and not driven by an organized religion, they should not be discarded as unworthy of our respect and attention. (Interestingly, there is more respect for vegan ethics in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, where vegan and vegetarian options abound and can be found on every pub menu. At the Edinburgh Zoo, you can even find a tasty lunch of vegan \u201cfish\u201d and chips!)\n\nAs Epstein writes, our spiritual and ethical beliefs can be just as powerful as organized religion. Even vegans have our spiritual leaders, such as author and advocate Gene Bauer (Farm Sanctuary), Dr. Dean Ornish, Dr. Campbell (The China Study) and Dr. Esselstyn (Forks Over Knives), Dr. Greger (How Not To Die). Vegan (plant-based) eating, as described in Forks Over Knives, is such an established health-based treatment option that the award-winning documentary based on the book has its own channel on the televisions at Montefiore Hospital in New York City. We know that plant-based eating is healthy and works. So, it seems that the problem that we have is with the images that the word \u201cvegan\u201d conjures up, rather than the habit of plant-based eating itself.\n\nPlease note that most vegans are ruled and run by their desire for compassion and kindness. We want there to be less suffering in the world. If you encounter a vegan that is rude, please understand that they are usually not angry at you personally, but rather frustrated at a world where our compassion is seen as inconvenient and our kindness as a burden. If only more people would take the time to know us, perhaps there would be less of a conflict. I want to personally thank you for reading this article. Your attention shows a deep appreciation for the human condition and for the diverse nature of our needs. I see so many people using the term \u201cplant-based\u201d in order to reduce the stigma of the word \u201cvegan\u201d, but perhaps we can work to reduce the stigma associated with the word \u201cveganism\u201d, as well.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1596, "llama_token_count": 1865}, {"source_name": "The Economist", "author": "The Economist", "title": "Workplace advice from our agony uncle", "description": "From hotdesking to nudity, your office questions answered", "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2023/07/20/workplace-advice-from-our-agony-uncle", "text": "D ear Max , I am an extremely nervous public speaker and I was told long ago that it can help to imagine that my audience is naked.

I doubt you are in breach of any rules unless you have told specific individuals that you are thinking about what they look like without clothes on. But it\u2019s probably wise not to repeat this piece of advice to anyone else. That\u2019s not just because it sounds so dodgy. In my experience it\u2019s also a hopeless tip: you will almost certainly end up feeling even more nauseous. It is better, and safer, to imagine people wearing many more clothes and ideally a balaclava, too.\n\nMy new team-mates try hard to establish an atmosphere of psychological safety. I genuinely agree with this aim, but one of our rules is that people can only talk in meetings if they are holding a wooden gourd. Whenever I am handed this ridiculous thing, I start laughing uncontrollably. Do you have any advice?\n\nIf your team are truly believers in psychological safety, then you should be able to tell them that gourd-handling is not what you came into the workplace to do. Perhaps you could suggest another way of giving the floor to people without interruption? Is there another object that you might find less absurd? If it is too difficult to have an honest conversation with them, then say, \u201cOh gourd, not this again,\u201d when it comes your way and before you begin sniggering. With luck your colleagues will just think you have a lame sense of humour.\n\nI am a repressed older man with no real capacity to feel. This barren emotional landscape has served me well for years. Now everyone around me keeps talking about the importance of kindness and authenticity, and I don\u2019t understand what the hell is going on. Please help.\n\nIt is true that the workplace has changed in recent years: empathy and compassion have become part of the lexicon of the modern workplace. But I want you to know that you are not alone; very many people share your lack of pain. There is no stigma attached to being unable to interrogate your own feelings or to trundling along in a state of emotional vacuity; it\u2019s a condition also known as being male. It\u2019s OK to feel invulnerable.\n\nDuring the pandemic I decided to move to Montana in order to fulfil my dreams and work remotely from a ranch I bought on credit. My company is now requiring people to come into the office two days a week. Unfortunately, the office is in New York and my commute takes about 12 hours each way if I\u2019m lucky. What should I do?\n\nThe obvious answer is that you need to change either your job or your location. But really you need to re-examine the way you take decisions. You are terrible at it.\n\nMy company has introduced hot-desking at our new post-pandemic office. This means I have been given a \u201chotbox\u201d to carry my photos and the team gourd to whichever desk I will be working at that day. Each morning I take my hotbox out of my locker and am struck afresh by the futility of life. Can you help?\n\nThis is a surprisingly common complaint from my correspondents. Hotboxes have to be small enough to carry: that means there is usually room only for a couple of personal possessions. To be one of a crowd wandering around in search of a place to settle down, with your existence distilled down to a handful of mementoes and a cactus, is profoundly depressing. It\u2019s like an episode of \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d with chinos. My advice would be to ditch the hotbox altogether and sit at a bare desk. You will work just as well and suffer from much less angst.\n\nLast month I got an unexpected promotion and went out with some friends to celebrate. The evening got a little out of hand and I woke in the morning to find that I had got a tattoo of my company logo. I don\u2019t expect you to be able to help, but I bitterly regret the decision and just wanted to tell someone.\n\nI followed up with this letter-writer directly to find out a little more. If the company in question had a fashionable brand, a logo might at least be passed off as a cool consumer choice. And with luck, the tattoo would be in a discreet place. No dice. It turns out that my correspondent works for an auditing firm. He has the letter \u201cE\u201d emblazoned on one eyelid, and the letter \u201cY\u201d on the other. You can see how that might have seemed really clever at the time. I cannot help this poor wretch but I\u2019ll be back with more of your workplace dilemmas as soon as I have made them up. \u25a0\n\nRead more from Bartleby, our columnist on management and work:\n\nExecutive coaching is useful therapy that you can expense (Jul 13th)\n\nHow white-collar warriors gear up for the day (Jul 6th)\n\nThe potential and the plight of the middle manager (Jun 29th)\n\nAlso: How the Bartleby column got its name", "tiktoken_token_count": 1089, "llama_token_count": 1253}, {"source_name": "Brooklyn Vegan", "author": "Bill Pearis", "title": "bdrmm break down every track on their fantastic new album 'I Don't Know'", "description": "\u2018I Don't Know\u2018 is out now via Mogwai's Rock Action Records\nContinue reading\u2026", "url": "https://www.brooklynvegan.com/bdrmm-break-down-every-track-on-their-fantastic-new-album-i-dont-know/", "text": "UK shoegazers bdrmm just released their second album, I Don\u2019t Know, which is also their first for Mogwai\u2019s Rock Action Records. With this one, they\u2019ve grown beyond the standard signifiers of the genre and have figured out their own sound, incorporating elements of dance music, krautrock, trip hop and post-rock. It\u2019s leaps and bounds over their very good 2020 debut and you can listen to the whole thing below.\n\nWe asked the band to tell us more about the album, and guitarist/vocalist Ryan Smith \u2014 who has come into his own as a singer on this one \u2014 takes us through all eight songs on the album, along the way telling stories about touring with Mogwai, the pandemic, the influence of Slowdive, Duster and Radiohead, and more. Read that below.\n\nI Don\u2019t Know by bdrmm I Don\u2019t Know by bdrmm\n\nbdrmm \u2013 \u2018I Don\u2019t Know\u2019 Track-by-Track\n\nALPS\n\nAlps was written whilst on tour with Mogwai. We were driving through the Swiss Alps (hence the title) and I was inspired by a mix by Thom Yorke for CRACK Magazine. I started with the percussion and went from there. The theme of the track is one of despair. While driving through such a beautiful place, but still being plagued by the constant feed of negative news coming through from back home. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d ever regard ourselves as a political band, but it\u2019s hard not to escape the constant depression that has been imposed on this country this year, and how I feel we\u2019re all just trying to cope but are seemingly forever moving backwards.\n\nBE CAREFUL\n\nBe Careful was written during the pandemic. (I said I\u2019d never write the P word again, but for honesty\u2019s sake). I had set up a little studio in the back of my garden and would often take myself there on evenings with numerous bottles of wine. Inspired by Portishead, and the bassline owes itself to Radiohead\u2019s Nude, this track just came so naturally. It\u2019s about taking care of yourself and realising when you need to change. I\u2019ve been guilty of indulging too much and I definitely noticed myself becoming somebody I don\u2019t like. When realising that, it felt important. Trying to be a better person is hard when you don\u2019t know you\u2019re doing something wrong.\n\nIT\u2019S JUST A BIT OF BLOOD\n\nMost people who have seen us tour will recognise this track as \u2018Picky New\u2019, essentially based on its guitar picking introduction and that it was a new song at the time. The more we played it, the more we realised it was becoming something special, and an integral part of our set. It stems from my recent mental health awareness. I\u2019d become depressed and very social anxious, I really felt like I had changed and didn\u2019t know who I was. I am lucky enough to be surrounded by 3 of my brothers within this band (one literally by blood) and have always been able to be myself with them. I guess it\u2019s just about realising what you have and remembering that when you can\u2019t see it.\n\nWE FALL APART\n\nWe Fall Apart is probably one of the last tracks that was written for the album. It is a nod to our admiration of Krautrock. We have always been huge fans of NEU! and Can, and I think that kind of got touched on with the first record, but we wanted to try and make something as pure as organic as it seemed they did. Stripping back the effects and trying to make it as real as possible. The vocals are about a relationship. Trying and trying to make something work and it still failing. You want it to happen so much that sometimes you don\u2019t realise that it\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s important to realise that moment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT ONE\n\nThis is another one of those tracks that was written on the road during the Mogwai tour. The piano parts were created using generative processing in the van, inspired by Brian Eno experiments with the delay line method in his Ambient series. I defined the parameters and then glued my favourite parts together into a cohesive piece that I subsequently learnt and recorded on the piano back at The Nave. Similarly, I sampled some drum recording that Conor did from the \u201cBe Careful\u201d sessions and reworked the takes into a 16-bar phrase, inspired by Boards of Canada and DJ Shadow. Writing for the band is something I\u2019ve always wanted to do, yet constantly dissuaded myself from. Ryan, Conor and Joe were all so supportive and encouraging during this period so it\u2019s appearance is owed to them.\n\nHIDDEN CINEMA\n\nThis was the final song to be finished on the record, and to be fair, it nearly didn\u2019t make it. We started and stopped on it so many times it seemed like it was doomed, but the final week, we approached it in a completely different way and it\u2019s now become one of our favourites on the record. This track is about reflection. I was technically homeless when I was in the midst of recording this record, and I was going through a tough time internally. Living in the mistakes that you\u2019ve made in the past and falling into the same situations. Sometimes you don\u2019t know when something is wrong, but when you come out of the other end, it\u2019s good to reflect on that time to not let it happen again.\n\nPULLING STITCHES\n\nI remember the exact day that we wrote this track. We were in the practise room, and I just started playing the first 2 chords, incorporating the bend as if I was literally winking at Kevin Shields, and Conor just looked at me like, \u201cThis is the one\u201d. I think we finished the track on that day. It\u2019s amazing when those moments happen, and it reminds you of why you do this. It\u2019s so obviously the Shoegaze adoration within us.\n\nA FINAL MOVEMENT\n\nThis track has been flying around for years. When I first wrote it, it was influenced by Duster, it was a VERY slow-core, emphasis on the bending of the notes. From there, it\u2019s taking many forms, when we performed it live, under the moniker \u2018Drug\u2019, it was definitely indebted to Slowdive\u2019s cover of Golden Hair, but from there it\u2019s taking a brand new route. Being avid fans of Oneohtrix Point Never, the opening chords are inspired by that of Chrome County. The way they come in just grab you instantly, and as soon as Jordan opens the track, I know the track has reached its natural home. The lyrics come from a place of understanding. It\u2019s a very cathartic track and to finally release it, and to close the album with it, feels very special. It\u2019s been a long journey, but it\u2019s good to finally be here.\n\n\u2014\n\nBDRMM \u2013 2023 TOUR DATES\n\nJune\n\nFriday 30th \u2013 Leeds \u2013 Jumbo Records\n\nJuly\n\nSaturday 1st \u2013 London \u2013 Rough Trade East (SOLD OUT)\n\nSunday 2nd \u2013 Brighton \u2013 Resident Records\n\nMonday 3rd \u2013 Bristol \u2013 Rough Trade\n\nTuesday 4th \u2013 Nottingham \u2013 Rough Trade\n\nWednesday 5th \u2013 Monorail \u2013 Glasgow\n\nAugust\n\nWednesday 23rd \u2013 Genoa, Italy \u2013 Mojotic Festival\n\nSeptember\n\nSaturday 2nd \u2013 Manchester \u2013 Manchester Psych Fest\n\nSunday 3rd Edinburgh \u2013 Edinburgh Psych Fest\n\nOctober\n\nTuesday 17th \u2013 Belgium, Bruges \u2013 Cactus Club\n\nWednesday 18th \u2013 Tourcoing, France \u2013 Le Grand Mix\n\nThursday 19th \u2013 Belgium, Antwerp \u2013 Trix Bar\n\nFriday 20th \u2013 Netherlands, Rotterdam \u2013 Left of the Dial\n\nSaturday 21st \u2013 Netherlands, Rotterdam \u2013 Left of the Dial\n\nMonday 23rd \u2013 Germany, Hamburg \u2013 Molotow\n\nTuesday 24th \u2013 Denmark, Copenhagen \u2013 Loppen\n\nWednesday 25th \u2013 Sweden, Stockholm \u2013 Hus 7\n\nThursday 26th \u2013 Sweden, Malmo \u2013 Plan B\n\nSunday 28th \u2013 Germany, Dresden \u2013 Kleinvieh Klub\n\nTuesday 30th \u2013 Germany, Berlin \u2013 Privatclub\n\nWednesday 31st \u2013 Germany, Cologne \u2013 Helios37\n\nNovember\n\nThursday 1st \u2013 Milan, Italy \u2013 Arci Bellezza\n\nFriday 2nd \u2013 Bologna, Italy \u2013 Covo Club\n\nSaturday 3rd \u2013 France, Paris \u2013 Point Ephemere\n\nSunday 4th \u2013 Netherlands, Amsterdam \u2013 Paradiso\n\nMonday 5th \u2013 Netherlands, Nijmegen \u2013 Merleyn\n\nFriday 12th \u2013 Glasgow \u2013 The Classic Grand\n\nMonday 13th \u2013 Birmingham \u2013 The Hare and Hounds\n\nTuesday 14th \u2013 Salford \u2013 The White Hotel (SOLD OUT)\n\nWednesday 15th \u2013 Nottingham \u2013 Bodega\n\nThursday 16th \u2013 Leeds \u2013 Stylus\n\nSaturday 18th \u2013 Cardiff \u2013 Clwb Ifor Bach\n\nSunday 19th \u2013 Bristol \u2013 Thekla\n\nMonday 20th \u2013 London \u2013 Scala\n\nWednesday 22nd \u2013 Cambridge \u2013 Mash\n\nThursday 23rd \u2013 Bedford \u2013 Esquires\n\nFriday 24th \u2013 Brighton \u2013 Patterns\n\nSunday 26th \u2013 Dublin \u2013 The Button Factory", "tiktoken_token_count": 1899, "llama_token_count": 2287}, {"source_name": "Consequence.net", "author": "Spencer Kaufman", "title": "Alice Cooper Appears on Official Arizona License Plate Design", "description": "The proceeds from the specialty plate benefit the music icon's Solid Rock Teen Centers.\nAlice Cooper Appears on Official Arizona License Plate Design\nSpencer Kaufman", "url": "https://consequence.net/2023/07/alice-cooper-arizona-license-plate/", "text": "Drivers in Arizona looking to add a little shock rock to their license plates can now do so, thanks to an official new design featuring Alice Cooper\u2019s image.\n\nThat\u2019s right, the O.G. shock rocker appears on one of five new specialty license plates issued by the state of Arizona, with a portion of the fees going to charitable causes.

They\u2019re members of the South Pasadena Preservation Foundation. Together, they took me back to a time when grasslands and cattle covered what today is asphalt and cars, and made the argument that July 4 should mean something more to Southern Californians than just Independence Day.\n\n\u201cThis was all open space up to the [110] freeway 50 years ago,\u201d Gutierrez said, waving out to the horizon as we stood in the shade of the palm trees.

The agreement established a new border, which meant the northern half of Mexico became the modern-day American Southwest. It also guaranteed to the Mexicans who stayed \u201cthe enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of\u201d their new country.\n\nWe all know how that worked out.\n\nAmerican history has long treated the agreement as a bump on the road to Manifest Destiny. Mexico, meanwhile, sees it as one of its most humiliating moments. For Mexican Americans, the treaty is a psychic wound that has never healed, proof that the American government \u2014 and gringos, by default \u2014 can never be trusted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nActivists used its broken promises to organize resistance. In 1972, for instance, the Brown Berets occupied Catalina Island for nearly a month, arguing that since the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo didn\u2019t mention it, they were reclaiming the Island of Romance for Mexico.\n\nRetired USC professor Felix Gutierrez stands in front of Adobe Flores in South Pasadena. The house is on the National Register of Historic Places. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\nI\u2019ve always associated grievance with the treaty. Gutierrez and Fuller Rusch wanted me to see it in a completely different context. He came armed with a folder full of clippings and a book about the history of the treaty; she carried an iPad.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of focus on the land that was lost\u201d because of the Mexican-American War, Gutierrez said. \u201cBut there should be equal emphasis on the people that remained.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe [California] are a microcosm of where the world is going to be,\u201d Fuller Rusch added. \u201cLiving together is not always harmonious. So we have to learn from each other and respect each other and fight for each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that fight\u201d for Mexican Americans, Gutierrez said as he gestured toward the Adobe Flores, \u201cstarted right here.\u201d\n\nCalifornia The House That Used to Be in Mexico In 1847, the fight for California ended at El Adobe Flores. But the Californios never left.\n\nGutierrez, whose ancestors came to Southern California in the 1840s, grew up with stories of Californio bravery in the face of American empire. The Mexican government had stripped them of heavy artillery, so all the Californios could fight the \u201cYankees\u201d (Gutierrez\u2019s term, not mine) with were lances, lariats and pistols.\n\nThose invaders initially \u201cgot the rear end kicked out of them,\u201d the profe said with a satisfied smile. The Californios won battles through the fall of 1846 in present-day Dominguez Hills, the San Pasqual Valley in San Diego County and the San Gabriel River near Montebello. But American forces, led by men such as Kearney, Fremont and Stockton, whose last names still pepper the California landscape, were marching on Los Angeles with more men and firepower.\n\nAdobe Flores in South Pasadena.

(Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times)\n\nFlores and other Californios gathered at an adobe ranch house in Rancho San Pascual, a Mexican land grant that encompassed most of Altadena, Pasadena, South Pasadena and San Marino. Those discussions culminated in the Treaty of Cahuenga, which the Americans and Mexicans signed in modern-day Studio City on Jan. 13, 1847. Decades later, the adobe was named in Flores\u2019 honor.\n\n\u201cFlores told the Americans, \u2018If we don\u2019t come to terms, we\u2019ll become guerrilla fighters and flee to the hills,\u2019 \u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only peace treaty in American history dictated by the losing side.\u201d\n\nThe armistice allowed Californios to keep their property and promised \u201cequal rights and privileges.\u201d But the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo stripped those guarantees a year and a half later. It\u2019s that loss, Gutierrez said, that we should remember on the Fourth of July, especially since this country has for too long treated Mexican Americans as little better than vassals.\n\n\u201cWe [Mexican Americans] have rights as American citizens,\u201d is the Californio message that should still resonate for everyone 175 years later, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just as good as you [Yankees]. Just give us a chance to show it.\u201d\n\nWorld & Nation Line Drawn in 1848 Shaped Who We Are Border: The treaty that ended the U.S. war with Mexico might have made a different California.\n\nI asked Fuller Rusch what she learned about the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo growing up. \u201cZero,\u201d she said with a laugh, then added: \u201cIt\u2019s one sentence in high school textbooks today. Maybe.\u201d\n\nThe profa takes pride in teaching her Latino students about the treaty in classes where she\u2019s \u201cthe only gringa in the room.

She noted that Anglos were the ones who preserved it instead of demolishing it, like too many buildings of the era. The same family has owned it since 1967, holding it as a rental property.\n\n\u201cOthers are able to tell its history,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a model for how to live.\u201d\n\nTenants from nearby apartment buildings blithely walked past Gutierrez and Fuller Rusch as they gave their mini-lecture.

At the time, Dooreck, a noted sommelier, managed a beverage program at the Hoxton Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had no idea that his inaugural Instagram sale would launch him on a career path that would give him the freedom he had long wished for. \u201cI have had a lot of random shifts since I left college,\u201d the 29-year-old explained last week at his Echo Park studio. \u201cThey all revolve around a central idea: being autonomous and working for myself.\u201d\n\nOriginally from New York, Dooreck graduated from McGill University in Montreal with a degree in kinesiology, only to realize upon graduation that he wasn\u2019t interested in medicine.\n\nDetails of clay shavings and pottery tools inside Daniel Dooreck\u2019s ceramics studio.

(Mariah Tauger / Los Angeles Times)\n\nDuring college, he worked as a line cook at various restaurants, including Momofuku, and became fascinated with wine. In 2019, he represented Canada at the prestigious Chaine des Rotisseurs Jeune Sommelier Competition in Seoul, South Korea, before becoming a part-owner of the neighborhood restaurant Taverne Bernhardts in Toronto.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt 24, he joined a pottery studio for fun. \u201cIt was $200 a month,\u201d Dooreck recalled. \u201cThat seemed like a lot of money at the time.\u201d He had no experience with pottery but taught himself how to throw vases and was soon spending several hours a week at the studio while working full-time at the restaurant.\n\nAfter selling his partnership in the restaurant in 2021, he moved to Los Angeles, not far from Santa Barbara where his mother, who is originally from China, and his father, who is a second-generation native of Brooklyn, N.Y., live. In L.A., Dooreck worked for a period as a sommelier at R\u00e9publique and \u201csold $5,000 bottles of wine.\u201d\n\nLike kinesiology, however, he was uninspired by restaurant work.\n\n\u201cIt was soulless,\u201d he said.\n\nInside Daniel Dooreck ceramics studio.

With the help of a friend, he made a website, logo and branding, and when he returned to Los Angeles, he set up Danny D\u2019s Mudshop in his Echo Park garage.\n\n\u201cTurning mud into really nice ceramics\u201d in his garage may be his deadpan slogan, but on a recent visit, Dooreck was all business as he finished an order for a new Mexican restaurant in Washington, D.C.\n\nAs Dooreck wanders through side-by-side garages, outfitted in dusty SnowPeak overalls, suede Birkenstock clogs and the vintage silver cowboy ring he uses to stamp his pottery, he demonstrates what it\u2019s like to own his own business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a laborious process,\u201d he said as he sat down and threw a vase at his potter\u2019s wheel. \u201cIt takes three days to create one piece, including throwing, drying, carving and painting.\u201d Dooreck is also in charge of marketing, production and fulfillment. He recently started a newsletter and has sold hundreds of T-shirts and totes, which he stores in bins below the cardboard boxes he has on hand for shipping. \u201cPeople like merch,\u201d he said with a shrug.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to grow my business into something sustainable,\u201d Dooreck said.

(Mariah Tauger / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAlthough he has always been a hobbyist, Dooreck didn\u2019t know much about painting or pottery before launching his pottery studio. He resists being called an \u201cartist\u201d because he says he is not a painter or an illustrator. Also, when it comes to his love of western art, which is inspired by L.A., he notes that he did not grow up watching westerns and doesn\u2019t even know how to ride a horse. Yet he has struggled to keep his textural hand-thrown pots, vases and copitas engraved with cowboy boots, snakes and cactus motifs in stock.\n\nDooreck\u2019s work resonates, particularly with younger customers, said his friend, author Jedidiah Jenkins, because it reflects the maker.\n\n\u201cWhat sets Daniel apart is his curiosity and bravado,\u201d Jenkins said in an email. \u201cThere\u2019s something about him that says, \u2018Why not me? Why shouldn\u2019t I try?\u2019 I think, coming from the restaurant world, a culture familiar with fast failure, he has developed a thick skin and the belief that it\u2019s better to try than just dream. And he\u2019s an incredibly hard worker. I\u2019ve noticed that he understands the importance of a story in a product. It\u2019s not just clever pottery; it\u2019s him, infused in each piece. His eccentric taste and eye. His smile. The man that orders for the table and knows the best wine and orders three bottles, that\u2019s the same guy who\u2019s making your vase and cracking himself up.\u201d\n\nCopita glasses, $37, can be used for mezcal or salt. (Mariah Tauger / Los Angeles Times)\n\nDooreck\u2019s work ranges from about $15 to $30 for a tiny copita glass to $450-$700 for a vase. (Mariah Tauger / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he first started making pottery five years ago, Dooreck gravitated toward sculptural vases with thin necks. Today, he is more focused on smaller goods that can be shipped easily such as copita glasses used for mezcal or salt, tumblers, ashtrays and wine glasses, which he produces simultaneously by throwing off the hump.\n\nAt a time when buying locally sourced goods matters to consumers, especially in L.A., Dooreck\u2019s hand-thrown vessels have landed in shops and restaurants worldwide in addition to his website. In just a year, he has more than 20 wholesale clients and employs two people part-time to help him with throwing and shipping. Dooreck\u2019s work, which ranges from about $30 for copitas to $700 for vases, balances the craft of pottery with the accessibility of flash tattoos and vintage American West art.\n\nDespite his success in Echo Park, Dooreck is ready to move on.\n\n\u201cI feel like a part of the community in Echo Park,\u201d he said of his neighbors, whom he has immortalized on Instagram and TikTok. \u201cBut I\u2019m outgrowing this space. It\u2019s great to interact with people, but I need to put my head down and focus. I need four more of me.\u201d\n\nIdeally Dooreck would like to move to a commercial studio where he can have a kiln, hire a few production potters to help him with his wholesale clients and host Color Me Mine-style carving workshops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA floating rubber duck next to the potter\u2019s wheel offers a glimpse into Dooreck\u2019s fun and playful personality.

The recently designated SLO Coast American Viticultural Area (AVA) was established in 2022 and covers the area from the Santa Barbara County line to the south and the Monterey County line to the north. The 78 vineyards here are defined by their proximity to the Pacific and the cool weather that it brings. The wineries are relaxed and approachable \u2014 many have no minimum spend on tastings, don\u2019t require reservations, and are just a short drive from downtown.\n\nOn a sunny afternoon visit, Jean-Pierre Wolff, winemaker and co-owner of Wolff Vineyards, exemplified the inclusiveness of the region\u2019s wineries as he told me how he\u2019s pleased when guests say they don\u2019t know anything about wine. California\u2019s newest AVA, it turns out, is the perfect place to learn.\n\nWith about 30 wineries producing wine from grape varieties like chardonnay, pinot noir, albari\u00f1o, syrah, grenache, and more, there\u2019s a wide range of wines to try depending on your palate. SLO Cast has a long growing season that leads to balanced wine grapes. Plus, compared to other California regions, the wines are surprisingly affordable.\n\nA particularly fun way to explore SLO Wine Country is with a sidecar tour from Third Wheel Tours. A modern spin on a vintage sidecar, Third Wheel can take you from winery to winery in style while providing great photo opportunities, or drive you around a single vineyard. I felt like the star of a black and white movie as I rode in the sidecar, eye level with luscious green vines, through gently rolling hills at Wolff Vineyards.\n\nFinding art, adventure, and locally crafted goods in SLO County\n\nIf arts and crafts are more your style, there\u2019s plenty to explore in San Luis Obispo. The city\u2019s artistic spirit is present in the many murals dotted around town, along with the ever quirky Bubble Gum Alley, a narrow stretch of high walls between two buildings that have been entirely coated in gum (regularly power washed, of course).\n\nSan Luis Obispo also offers a myriad of physical activities and adventures. Whether that\u2019s an aerial yoga class at The Center Slo or a gentle sunset hike up Terrace Hill. In the case of the latter, the easy 0.8-mile hike led to an unobstructed plateau where you can sit and enjoy the city below. I used it as an opportunity for a meditation session with a local guide, but others simply visited with friends or gazed at the view.\n\nThe Hat Bar by Kate Kaney\n\nI was particularly enthralled with a hat making experience at The Hat Bar by Kate Kaney. Kaney had seen hat making, where guests are invited to select a blank hat from their wide selection before choosing from an array of supplies with which to decorate the hat, take place in other cities before deciding to bring the concept home to her already well-known boutique, The Mercantile. I sifted through piles of colorful feathers, bright buttons, ribbons, leather, and twine like a kid in a candy shop, thoughtfully selecting items that would color match and offset one another while representing aspects of my own personality and hobbies. After, the staff helped secure the items to my hat and assisted with personal branding by burning my initials into the hat. Our entire group left with smiles on our faces, proudly donning our new creations.\n\nThe Mercantile and The Hat Bar: 950 Chorro St, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401\n\nHorseback Riding\n\nTo evoke the cowboy past of the region, take a trail ride with Madonna Inn & Stables to the top of a nearby hill overlooking fields and rolling plains below.

As I rode Cactus, a brown and white pinto stallion, a prairie dog sat perched on a rock surveying the terrain, pink and yellow cactus flowers bloomed and a turkey vulture circled above.\n\nMadonna Inn & Stables: 100 Madonna Road, San Luis Obispo, CA\n\nAnam Cre\u2019 Pottery Studio\n\nSpent a relaxing morning or afternoon at Anam Cre\u2019 Pottery Studio, which offers classes, workshops, and a membership community where students can learn the fundamentals of working with clay. We learned to throw on the pottery wheel, sculpting beautiful mugs and later carved slabs of clay into cheese boards decorated with delicate stamp work.\n\nAnam Cre\u2019 Pottery Studio: 1243 Monterey St Suite 100, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401\n\nVibe Health Lounge\n\nThe city\u2019s go-to healing center and day spa, Vibe Health Lounge offers guests a place to unwind and reconnect. After one of the best massages I\u2019ve ever had (and I do pride myself on being a bit of a massage connoisseur), I indulged in state of the art holistic treatments such as a Chakra Crystal Vibroacoustic Sound Bed, a relaxing massage bed with colored chakra crystals and sound therapy; and the Lucia N\u00b003 Light Experience, a form of light therapy meant to lower stress and provide deep relaxation.\n\nVibe Health Lounge: 1238 Monterey St, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401\n\nThe Center Yoga Studio\n\nThis yoga studio is the perfect place to reset and unwind. There are two non-heated studios and an infrared-heated studio where classes are held every day of the week, and guests can choose from a variety of different types of activity, including hot yoga, barre, HIIT, and pilates. One highlight is the aerial yoga, where hammocks act as a prop that helps you through various postures and ends with a savasana in the hammock.\n\nThe Center Yoga Studio: 672 Higuera St, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401\n\nWhere to eat in San Luis Obispo\n\nEbony\n\nOne sunny day, I spent the afternoon learning how to make injera, a form of sour fermented bread from Ethiopia, at Ebony with restaurant founder Helen Abraha, before lunching on her delicious food. A family run business, Abraha and team open up their restaurant every Thursday to Saturday offering organic, vegan, and gluten-free Ethiopian dishes with a focus on community and climate-friendly practices. Going from cooking for her actual neighbors to full blown restauranteur, Abraha has created a spot that\u2019s a worthwhile stop.\n\nEbony: 4750 Allene Way, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401\n\nMistura\n\nMistura offers Peruvian gastronomy in downtown SLO along with a gourmet chocolatier. Chef Nicola Allegretta serves creative Peruvian dishes that balance the traditional and modern, from chicha morada pisco sours (complete with house-distilled pisco), to aj\u00ed de gallina (a spicy chicken stew), to lomo saltado (a Peruvian stir fry), to mushroom or lobster ravioli and Peruvian sushi. Meanwhile, gourmet chocolates and desserts made by renowned pastry chef Florencia Breda are sold at Breda, the chocolatier inside Mistura. There, Breda\u2019s sweets are edible works of art that could easily be found in any gourmet chocolatier in Paris, and taste even better. I sipped on my cold pisco sour and bit into a gooey, delicately painted chocolate, wondering whether I\u2019d suddenly landed in Peru or Paris.\n\nMistura: 570 Higuera St, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401\n\nDowntown San Luis Obispo Farmers\u2019 Market\n\nThis lively event runs for five blocks in the center of town every Thursday, showcasing food stalls, arts and crafts, street performers, and more. As elsewhere in town, farm to table is a way of life and vendors showcase the local bounty, which no doubt inspires the vibrant restaurant scene nearby. This being California, the market runs through winter from 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM November through February, and 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM March through October.\n\nDowntown San Luis Obispo Farmers\u2019 Market: Higuera Street downtown\n\nNovo\n\nLocated in the heart of downtown SLO, this restaurant focuses on locally sourced ingredients used in globally inspired recipes, craft cocktails, an award-winning wine list, and a breathtaking atmosphere. Sitting under the trees which lean out over the creek, I once again felt as though I was somewhere else entirely.\n\nNovo: 726 Higuera St, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401\n\nWhere to stay in San Luis Obispo\n\nWe hope you love the spaces we recommend! Just so you know, Matador may collect a small commission from the links on this page if you decide to book a stay.\n\nGranada Hotel & Bistro\n\nAfter my cross-country flight from NYC and a quick 2-mile drive, I arrived in the city center, where I checked in to the enchanting Granada Hotel & Bistro.\n\nThis historic boutique hotel is in a building that was built in 1922. It went through several changes over the decades before being lovingly restored and reopened as the hotel in 2012. Within the original brick walls, the hotel offers 17 unique guest rooms, some large and spacious with a private terrace or balcony, others cozy and charming, but all with chic modern bathrooms, in-room fireplaces and decor serves as an ode to a bygone era. The hotel also has a popular restaurant serving up globally inspired, locally sourced cuisine in a leafy, garden setting; and Nightcap, a craft cocktail bar decked out in leather, wood, and exposed brick.\n\nAs I climbed the steps and entered the dimly lit lobby, my eyes adjusting from the bright sunlight outside, I noticed piano keys hung artistically above a set of old-fashioned key boxes behind the check in desk. I sipped a glass of cold California ros\u00e9 poured by the concierge, and the scent of rosewood, copal, and amber (the hotel\u2019s signature scent) filled the air. I raised my glass and settled into my chair as the hustle and bustle of New York City already felt like a lifetime away.\n\nI stayed in one of the premiere suites, The Granada Queen, featuring a Juliet balcony, floor to ceiling windows, exposed brick, and a curved shower with a peekaboo window. I peered out over the balcony at the leafy street below and imagined myself sipping a coffee and reading my favorite book.\n\nBook Now\n\nThe Madonna Inn\n\nConstructed in 1958, the pseudo-Swiss-Alps exterior of the historic Madonna Inn gives way to a bright pink lobby accented by an overwhelming amount of flowers, hammered copper, stone, and western murals. It\u2019s like if the Swiss Alps and 1950s Vegas had a baby, and then Elvis and Dolly Parton decorated. It\u2019s wonderfully kitsch, and, quite frankly, I was all for it. The signature bright pink color is everywhere \u2013 from the pink brocade wallpaper to the pink leather seats topped with ornate gold banisters alongside pale pink tablecloths, to the bright pink carpet patterned with oversized pink roses and blue hydrangeas. In the evening, diners tuck into steak and drink from enormous, jewel-toned goblets while the enormous stone fireplace roars gently.\n\nThe Swiss-Alps style restaurant and bakery next door are equally iconic, serving world famous cakes like the Pink Champagne, a white cake with layers of Bavarian and whipped cream and topped with neon pink curls. The entire place is so grandiose and full of character and well worth a stop for photos or a snack in the restaurant and bakery, even if you\u2019re not staying here.\n\nBook Now", "tiktoken_token_count": 2464, "llama_token_count": 3022}, {"source_name": "Brothers-brick.com", "author": "Chuck Hagenbuch", "title": "LEGO Dreamzzz 71459 Stable of Dream Creatures [Review]", "description": "Featuring bright colors and fanciful shapes, will 71459 Stable of Dream Creatures hold up during review?

Today let\u2019s skip nightmares entirely and explore a relaxing place of peace, beauty, and wonder: 71459 Stable of Dream Creatures. There are no Grimspawn, Night Terrors, or other bad dreams here \u2013 just giant flowered dream deer, a windmill, and a\u2026 a cat cactus? Yeah, a cat cactus. If you\u2019ve watched the first 10 episodes of the TV show\u2026 either you spotted something we didn\u2019t, or you\u2019ll recognize the deer, and that\u2019s it. In any case, here\u2019s our review of the set, which contains 681 pieces, 4 minifigures + 2 dreamlings + cat cactus + z-blob, and can be pre-ordered now and will ship August 1st for US $79.99 | CAN $99.99 | UK \u00a374.99.\n\nThe LEGO Group provided The Brothers Brick with an early copy of this set for review. Providing TBB with products for review guarantees neither coverage nor positive reviews.\n\nUnboxing the parts, instructions, and stickers\n\nWhen the initial Dreamzzz set images started trickling out, this set stood out for the bright and attractive color palette, and the wildly imaginative flora that decorates the stable and the dream deer. The front shows one of the two alternate build endpoints, and the back shows how the base deer build can be decorated two ways.\n\nInside are 7 numbered bags, a modest sticker sheet, and the instruction manual. The greens and blues really stand out, and the pieces for the orange-yellow ombre roof sort of hide in there.\n\nAs we noted in our first Dreamzzz review, it\u2019s worth taking a closer look at the instructions. The cover features a very attractive drawn-style illustration of the set, and the inside continues with illustrations of the minifigures and scenes in a similar style. Again this is not the animation style of the show (that would be absolutely gorgeous but we\u2019re guessing also a ton of work). And the pages are consistently color coded: Dream Chaser (the heroes) minifigures or builds have a yellow background, the Nightmare King\u2019s forces use magenta, the first decision-point build uses blue, the second uses green. This set being free of nightmares there\u2019s no magenta. The illustrations also seem to imply that the characters are each dream crafting parts of the stable.\n\nThe build\n\nThe stable is built in three main sections \u2013 first the central section, followed by the sides. The middle starts with a tiny kitchen, the entrance way, and and a ladder up to the second floor. There you build the most elaborate piece of the stable, the wind-driven grist mill. The stickers, loaf of bread, and sack imply that the mill is producing flour, though we do wonder what dream flour is made from \u2013 perhaps those enormous stalks of wheat near the stable? The windmill can be spun from the blades, or by turning the 2\u00d72 brick at the back capped by the Dream Chasers hourglass symbol.\n\nThe sides of the stable add a small dining area, and a barn stall (complete with the 1\u00d71 brown swirl \u201cpoop piece\u201d \u2026 guess dream deer still have regular digestive tracts). The builds are mostly simple stacking, and go quickly. The roof is the most interesting bit of building here, placed at 3 different angles to match the roof line, and transitioning from yellow to bright orange to orange as it descends.\n\nThe final part of the build is the dream deer. These have appeared briefly in the first episode of the show, first grazing in a peaceful dreamscape, and then running from Grimspawn as the Nightmare King\u2019s forces appear, looking for dreamers. The creatures in the show are more yellow on their legs, but the flower antlers are quite similar. These are definitely the highlight of the set in our opinion. The neck does look awkward \u2013 by which we mean barely attached \u2013 from some angles, but that\u2019s the only flaw. It\u2019s huge, compared to a minifigure, and utterly majestic.\n\nThe second build option adds large flower petal wings and switches the antlers to giant blue flowers. It\u2019s nice that it\u2019s a different form, not just a color swap. It also looks great.\n\nThe minifigures\n\nIzzy, Zoey, and Cooper are the included Dream Chasers. The first wave only has one main variant for each character \u2013 Cooper has two different leg options, and capes and utility belts come and go, but the torsos, heads, and hair (besides a helmet or two) are all the same. So even though the Stable seems to be a place of peace and relaxation, Cooper only has either a determined or sleepy expression. All 3 minifigures feature detailed printing on both sides of the torso and the front of the legs, though only Izzy\u2019s are dual-molded, and they each have dual-sided heads. Izzy\u2019s hair is particularly impressive, a dual-molded translucent satiny blue-pink mane.\n\nMrs. Castillo runs a food truck that sells absolutely amazing-sounding breakfast burritos (Korean short rib, mahi-mahi, \u2026 pardon us, we\u2019ll be back after a snack break). Ahem. The new \u201clittle old lady\u201d mold is adorable, but the necessity of the built-in backpack is a little unfortunate for reusability. It should make for some interesting connection points though! Through the first ten episodes of the show, Mrs. Castillo shows up occasionally in the Dream World, and is aware of knowing the Dream Chasers, but doesn\u2019t seem to be a dream crafter herself. However in the sets, she has her own hourglass \u2013 which are to dream crafting how wands are to magic; you can do it without them but it\u2019s a lot harder. Her walking stick/staff incorporates one, though it doesn\u2019t have the hourglass symbol capping it that the other Dream Chasers do.\n\nZ-Blob and the Dreamlings use a body mold that\u2019s also shared with the Grimspawn throughout the theme. The cleverest feature of this mold is that each armpit is a clip connection, able to hold on to bars including many accessories. Now, most of these lil\u2019 dudes will fall over if you give them a sword, but that\u2019s another matter. Z-Blob has the slightly creepy green head with eyes but no mouth (Mateo never drew him with a mouth, so when he comes to life in the Dream World he doesn\u2019t have one there either and can\u2019t talk), along with a transparent green slime veil \u2013 which does fit on regular minifigures if you like. This is probably the Blob\u2019s cutest form in our opinion. The Dreamlings have fun purple mushroom printed \u201ccaps\u201d, along with a double-sided head that even has what looks like golden mycelium printing continuing on the back. Someone is going to make an army of these and it\u2019s going to be the most terrifying cute thing ever.\n\nThere\u2019s also the Cat Cactus. It\u2019s cute! It hasn\u2019t shown up in the show yet though, and LEGO\u2019s set description doesn\u2019t give us any additional information, so we\u2019re not sure what else to say about it. It seems to be associated with Mrs. Castillo, since it also appears in her Turtle Van.\n\nThe finished model\n\nThe alternate build choices for this set are minimal \u2013 mostly the deer and the tree swap foliage, with the bits coming up from above the barn stall swapping also. If you\u2019re conservative in what you take apart, you can keep most of the assemblies together \u2013 the blue flowers are used as-is, for example. It\u2019s not bad, but mostly it makes us want two deer so I can have both the blue and magenta versions built at the same time! Your reviewer is seriously considering getting the pieces for a second deer for just that reason (the eyes are printed, so at least you don\u2019t need to also get another sticker sheet if you want to do this\u2026).\n\nEither way the foliage looks good. The back of the stable, however, is very open and looks somewhat unfinished. If you bought two copies of the set, putting them back to back would leave a gap even if you took out the slight concave forward curve of the building. There are certainly play opportunities, but the windmill is the only real feature, and much of the play revolves around the deer and things outside the stable.\n\nConclusion and recommendation\n\nThis is a really lovely set. The colors are bright and fit the Dream World perfectly. The foliage is imaginative and wild and gorgeous. The Dreamlings are mushroom-ily adorable. The included minifigures are highly detailed. And we\u2019ve been clear on how much we like the deer. Unfortunately, it also comes with an $80 list price, and \u2026 we\u2019re not quite sure why. Piece count isn\u2019t everything, but this set isn\u2019t packed with large pieces and doesn\u2019t have any exclusive minifigures. It would feel much more attractively priced at $70, but our preference would be to have included a second dream deer. That would add a ton of play and make the set feel like very good value. As-is, we don\u2019t think anyone will be disappointed in this set, but we can\u2019t recommend it as a set to pick above others in the theme at list price. And that\u2019s a shame, because it captures the gentle side of the dream world so beautifully.\n\n71459 Stable of Dream Creatures contains 681 pieces, 4 minifigures, 2 dreamlings, a cat-cactus, and a z-blob.

To better understand where we\u2019re going, let\u2019s run back the clock and replay how we got here.\n\nFrom social media to culture media\n\nOver the past decade, as we\u2019ve spent more of our lives gawking at our phones, brands invested more in the platforms that came to define the era: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Snap. Brands became convinced that joining in on trending conversations would unlock cultural resonance. Agencies hired tweens to tweet the right combo of emojis and internet slang. The influencer economy boomed as brands bought platform reach and relevance. With the right bump of paid social, campaigns racked up views, and everyone high-fived each other.\n\nOnly nah. Not really. Not anymore. All eras must come to an end\u2014even for brands who say \u201cbae.\u201d Evidence of this era\u2019s demise surrounds us: the death spiral of Meta and Musk; mass layoffs across the tech industry; the surgeon general\u2019s warning in May that social media can be harmful to children. But as well as something ending, it also feels like something is beginning.\n\nYour first taste of the new era came when a TikTok video popped up in your feed and spoke directly to your core\u2014more than any existing social media platform or TV commercial ever did. That first sweet hit of algorithmic dopamine hits different. Forget your friends\u2014this was about you. A \u201cFor You\u201d video feed that gets better the more you\u2019re on it, through machine learning analysis of your data set. It literally knows what u \u2764\ufe0f before u even \u2764\ufe0f it.\n\nIn this new era, content media has evolved from a network of \u201cfriends\u201d into a living database of your own personal identity, tailored to the fluid way you see the world and the communities you see yourself in. The content machines now understand what you\u2019re obsessed with and, even more impressively, what you will likely become obsessed with. Cultural zeitgeist as we know it faces an existential threat\u2014shared monoculture is splintering into a bazillion algorithmically curated subcultures. Identity is no longer confined to where people live or what your IRL circle is talking about at the lunch table. You can now obsess over anything you want, wherever, whenever, however you want.\n\nNo clearer is this example illustrated than with the launch of Threads, Meta\u2019s unbridled effort to take down Twitter at its weakest moment. Threads has made a remarkable entrance into the social media landscape, luring in reluctant users from Twitter and Instagram and amassing a staggering 100 million users within its first week. We didn\u2019t know we needed another social platform, even one built as progressively as Threads, and yet we can\u2019t help ourselves when another opportunity is provided to swipe deeper into our interests.\n\nThreads hopes to succeed where Twitter ultimately struggled, orienting its community building around our desire to see more from creators we already follow. Only time will tell if Zuck will finally deliver Twitter\u2019s death knell, but early signs are looking strong, and Musk is not happy\u2014we just may get that cage match after all.\n\nGet obsessive\n\nWhat it takes to win in this new era is a shared obsession. Ask yourself: What is it that our customers are *really* obsessed with, and how can we share those obsessions in ways that will make our customers feel seen?\n\nThe opportunity for marketers is clear: Speak, create and nurture these new subcultural realities, and you\u2019ll find audiences that want to grow and co-create with you. To communicate effectively in this new era, brands must speak truth to more specific audiences in a language they understand, sharing artifacts and beliefs that create a unified respect of the culture we share.\n\nIn our work, it looks like Nike empowering everyday athletes. For McDonald\u2019s, it\u2019s loving your order. For Visa, it\u2019s ensuring that anyone can make it. For Samsung, it\u2019s technology improving quality of life.\n\nGone are the days of brands simply tossing out influencer content and seeing significant engagement. You can always pay for views, but it\u2019s much harder to convert those into likes, shares, comments, follows and fandom. There\u2019s too much content that people are actually interested in for them to care about ads. They need to see something that moves them.\n\nMachine learning media platforms are, ironically, forcing brands to think deeper about human connections and genuine community artifacts over automated platform best practices. Brands who know their audience and share their obsessions can show up and be welcomed in spaces where marketing is usually swiped away on sight. Creating authentic storytelling from those places is an earned opportunity they can capitalize on every day.\n\nThe idea is to stop throwing darts at an unfathomable board. Aim instead for the bullseye: your niche communities, the nooks and crannies of your brand\u2019s fandom where you\u2019d be welcomed as a guest, not an intruder. And when you find them, gin up the courage to speak directly and authentically to them with something meaningful and interesting to say. Show them you understand and are working hard to make it better, whatever it is (and hopefully for good, not evil).\n\nBrands who\u2019ll succeed in this new era are those pursuing marketing approaches that prioritize specialized subcultures and communities over blindly targeting mass audiences. It\u2019s not easy to start thinking about specific markets and micro-influence, especially for brands who\u2019ve been used to measuring success by scale and mass influence. But when it\u2019s done well, the impact can be significant: Nike standing behind Kaepernick. McDonald\u2019s releasing adult Happy Meal toys with Cactus Plant Flea Market. Teyana Taylor celebrating Harlem for Jordan Brand. Delta being styled by Issa Rae.\n\nBy engaging with particular subcultures, and devoting dollars to providing value to them, marketers can build genuine connections, foster brand loyalty, drive valuable relationships that contribute to long-term business objectives and achieve more effective marketing results.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1384, "llama_token_count": 1660}, {"source_name": "GamesIndustry.biz", "author": "Jeffrey Rousseau", "title": "2023 Games for Change Awards unveiled", "description": "Sign up for the GI Daily here to get the biggest news straight to your inbox\nOrganization Games for Change has announced the winners of its 2023 awards.\n\nThis year's recipients were Free Lives' Terra Nil for Most Innovative and Howard Delafield International'\u2026", "url": "https://www.gamesindustry.biz/2023-games-for-change-awards-unveiled", "text": "Sign up for the GI Daily here to get the biggest news straight to your inbox\n\nOrganization Games for Change has announced the winners of its 2023 awards.\n\nThis year's recipients were Free Lives' Terra Nil for Most Innovative and Howard Delafield International's Go, Nisha, Go: My Life My Choice, who took home the Best Learning Game recognition.\n\nThis year's award winners were unveiled during the Games for Change Festival Awards Ceremony.

It\u2019s hot pink, tongue-in-cheek frivolity; it\u2019s the tip of a wave of revisionist IP. Speed Drive, the pop chameleon Charli XCX\u2019s contribution to the soundtrack, follows suit. A hyperpop banger \u201cabout just being hot\u201d with its foot on the gas for all of one minute, 58 seconds, it feels potentially designed for TikTok virality \u2013 short, endlessly loopable, the soundtrack to a hot girl summer. It\u2019s also addictive, playful fun, the sonic equivalent of barreling down the highway with your friends, late-night adrenaline, temporarily impenetrable confidence, uppers. No thoughts, just frenetic vibes on loop, thanks in part to a version of Toni Basil\u2019s Mickey reprocessed for screen-addled brains. Once you\u2019ve rewired to the song\u2019s relentless 174bpm, it\u2019s difficult to come back down. (Do not try to parallel park to this song.) Am I getting steamrolled by the commerce machine? Maybe, but Speed Drive is a high I\u2019ll keep chasing all summer long. Adrian Horton\n\nKylie Minogue \u2013 Padam Padam\n\nAny number of artists could have done Padam Padam, but only Kylie Minogue could nail its end-of-the-pier humor and coquettish sexuality \u2013 and sell the absurdity of it all like it is the secret to life. The lead single from her 16th album is a full love boat fantasy laced with below-deck seediness; you can imagine its metallic echoing through a cruise ship engine room amid hissing turbines and sea men wielding heavy machinery. It\u2019s made for this summer\u2019s best memes, but Padam Padam is stickier than a passing fad, with a vampish undercurrent of thick bass and pitched down vocals alongside cheeky demands to get your kit off. And while Minogue\u2019s recent singles have been colored by wistful longing and a refusal to be counted out, Padam Padam is unburdened by the personal narrative of its performer, freeing Minogue up to play sunny showgirl once more. It exists in its own shiny bubble of dance-pop joy. Owen Myers\n\nThe Dare \u2013 Sex\n\nSome of the best songs of summer ooze sex. My pick for the best summer song of 2023 \u2013 a song that\u2019s actually called Sex \u2013 oozes the virtual opposite. While this hilarious ditty by The Dare has been seen by many as a throwback to the randy indie sleaze scene, it\u2019s more like a wacky send-up of it. The clunking synth beat in the song is about as a funky as a metronome, the vocals about as erotic as a zombie, and the lyrics the precise inverse of pillow talk. \u201cSex, it\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of / Some people call it \u2018love\u2019 / I might even finish way too quick,\u201d deadpans Harrison Patrick Smith, the 27-year-old New Yorker who performs as the Dare. Along with that cheeky salute to premature ejaculation, Smith\u2019s blunt verse also includes allusions to incest, S&M, threeways and a hit-it-and-quit-it situation. His couplets can be clever in a Wet Leg meets Kim Petras\u2019s Slut Pop sort of way \u2013 ie \u201cSex / It doesn\u2019t hurt to try / Sometimes the hurt is why.\u201d Or, \u201cSex, to me / It\u2019s just a mystery / A lie we tell / Together we can prove it.\u201d The music has some smart twists too, especially halfway through, when a putrid slab of synthesized something comes plopping into the mix with a fury that evokes nothing so much as someone taking a dump in the middle of the recording. Critics of the song \u2013 and there have been many - call it \u201ccringy\u201d. I call it something else: \u201cbrilliant\u201d. Jim Farber\n\nJorja Smith \u2013 Little Things\n\nThe British singer Jorja Smith caused a minor stir last summer with her track All of This, when accusations of appropriation were levelled at its take on a style of house music that originated in South Africa called amapiano. But her latest single, Little Things, hones in on dancefloors closer to home. Its clackety-clack rhythmic workout is reminiscent of the glory days of UK funky (\u201csi-mi-nuh party hard\u201d), while the jaunty jazz-piano flourishes could have come off any broken beat classic. Production by P2J and New Machine aside, this is a nimble-footed anthem for the summer of singledom, where Smith enters a room, spots a hottie and hopes for a quick fling with them before she heads home. Smith is perhaps best known for her smouldering torch songs and it\u2019s refreshing to hear her in this new light: fun, flirty and feeling herself in the run-up to her new album, falling or flying. The drum\u2019n\u2019bass remix with Nia Archives, meanwhile, turbo-charges the BPM and takes Little Things from the house party to the festival. Kate Hutchinson\n\nOlivia Rodrigo \u2013 Vampire\n\nIn a sea of sub-Swiftian young singer-songwriters, ex-Disney star Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s poignant debut Driver\u2019s License drove its way into our heads and hearts back in 2021 for its sad specificity. There was pulsing, prickly anger but it was overtaken by melancholy even when the song eventually goes up a gear. For sophomore album-starter Vampire, that sadness has been sucked out, falling tears replaced with growing bile. The 20-year-old is in a justified rage at a blood-sucking, fame-fucking opportunist (who could be anyone from her ex Zack Bia or, if some theorists are to be believed, alleged ex-friend Taylor Swift herself) and backed by frantic, thrilling piano, recalling both Elton John and the Beatles (the old guard\u2019s warm embrace of Rodrigo is easily explainable), she swiftly convinces us to remain fixed in her corner. Like Driver\u2019s License, it starts somewhere small and ends somewhere huge, and like that song it\u2019s a canny, cathartic place for us to exorcise our own demons, whatever or whomever they may be. Benjamin Lee\n\nJessie Ware \u2013 That! Feels Good!\n\nWith respect to the likes of Boygenius and Weyes Blood, as the world burns, I refuse to listen to sad music. I am simply depressed enough! You\u2019ll find me instead on dancefloors both literal and imagined, which is why I fully support pop\u2019s current obsession with disco and house-tinged songs. Beyonc\u00e9 got the party started with last year\u2019s instant classic Renaissance, and Jessie Ware continues the disco revival with my personal song of the summer, That! Feels Good! Ware enlisted a chorus of famous voices like Kylie Minogue and R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy to coo the titular line in a euphoric spoken-word intro, Love to Love You-style. Then the bass line kicks in, staccato, bouncing and rollicking, the musical embodiment of a night out. Salted rims and pink champagne feature into the lyrics, but it\u2019s not all fluff. \u201cJust remember, pleasure is a right,\u201d Ware sings during the bridge. Pop music traffics fantasies, and these days, it can feel like the ultimate fantasy is just making it to Friday night. Alaina Demopoulos\n\nAmaarae \u2013 Counterfeit\n\nEverything about Ghanaian American Amaarae\u2019s recent second album, Fountain Baby, screams summer idyll. Firstly, there\u2019s the shower-based artwork\u2019s confident sexual desire with a hint of practicality given heatwave-induced sweatiness, while musically it\u2019s a luxurious take on the perfect barbecue soundtrack, all muscle-relaxing polyrhythms, steel pan filigrees and sauntering horn sections. It\u2019s inclusive too: prefer your summer soundtrack to have a hint of emo? Enjoy Sex, Violence, Suicide\u2019s frantic punk-pop coda. But it\u2019s the confident swagger of Counterfeit that stands out. Built around a re-recorded sample of Clipse\u2019s 2006 Neptunes-produced heater, Wamp Wamp (What It Do), it reverberates with a heady sense of abandon, its playground chorus of \u201cRich bitch, rich bitch / Na-na-na-na-na\u201d an intoxicating, drinks aloft mantra. While Clipse paired their braggadocio with nihilism, here Amaarae is far more playful, flitting between love for her \u201c30 bitches in the crib\u201d and for her stacks of money. In the end, she chooses the latter: \u201cI reminisce and kiss the cash \u2018cause really that\u2019s my baby.\u201d An unrelatable sentiment for most, sure, but the best summer anthems are all about fantasy. Michael Cragg\n\nCoi Leray \u2013 Players (DJ Saige remix)\n\nThe fast-rising New Jersey-bred emcee scored her first top-10 hit with Players, the lead single off her sophomore LP which sampled Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five\u2019s The Message and inspired remixes from DJ Smallz and David Guetta over the winter. But the DJ Saige rework that dropped at the end of March, adding a fresh verse from Busta Rhymes while interpolating the Brooklyn doyen\u2019s seminal 1997 smash Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See, is more than a fresh coat of paint: it\u2019s pure pop perfection and the brand of weapons-grade earworm with legs that will carry well past Labor Day. The streets have been divided throughout the swift ascent of Leray, the daughter of the Source magazine founder Benzino, who\u2019s been derided as a TikTok rapper and nepo baby/industry plant while also being hailed as one of hip-hop\u2019s most exciting (and over-hated) new talents. Your mileage may vary, but the latest and greatest Players remix \u2013 which has been unavoidable on Hot 97 since it dropped at the end of March \u2013 is the sort of old school/new school marriage with a broad appeal that won\u2019t be ignored. Bryan Armen Graham\n\nR\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy \u2013 CooCool\n\nCooCool is as soft as R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy\u2019s last album, R\u00f3is\u00edn Machine, was fiercely hard. It\u2019s the sound of skin yielding to summer warmth, the first gulp of spritz-hitting, \u201csilly season\u201d, as she puts it, descending to melt away self-seriousness and fear. Made in collaboration with the impish German producer DJ Koze, the lead single from her forthcoming album Hit Parade gradually expands from cicada hiss and ambient glow to playful bass, boisterous brass, noodly little bits of guitar and radiant soul samples via some quizzical yet weirdly perfect samples of someone enthusiastically cleaning their teeth. It\u2019s an incitement to freedom: the fulfilment of, as Murphy puts it, \u201ca life\u2019s work to funkify\u201d. Laura Snapes\n\nDua Lipa \u2013 Dance the Night\n\nConsidering that it hails from the most talked-about movie of the summer (Barbie, of course), it checks out that it\u2019s also a formidable contender for the singular song of the sweltering season. While showcasing nothing technically groundbreaking in the lyrics department, Dua Lipa\u2019s Dance the Night is a deceptively simple bop which transforms a concept heard a million times over into something fresh and fun. Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that the shiny repackaging, wrapped with disco strings and topped with an explosive chorus, comes courtesy Dua Lipa\u2019s go-to co-writer, Caroline Allin (Don\u2019t Start Now, New Rules), along with the mega-producer Mark Ronson, the latter known to enthrallingly toy with the sounds of yesteryear (see: Uptown Funk, or his work with Amy Winehouse). There\u2019s no use in resisting: throw on your best pink threads and let the joy of the track wash over you as you dutifully follow what its title suggests. Rob LeDonne\n\nPangaea \u2013 Installation\n\nAcross 16 years, Hessle Audio has established itself as one of the UK\u2019s greatest dance music labels: cerebral without being dry, and bass and breakbeat-loving without cleaving to any one genre (Objekt\u2019s Cactus, Joe\u2019s Claptrap, Peverelist\u2019s Dance Til the Police Come and Bruce\u2019s What are just some of their greatest hits). Pangaea, AKA Kevin McAuley, is one of the three founders alongside Ben UFO and Pearson Sound, and his own work perfectly encapsulates Hessle\u2019s balance between clever, artful arrangements and total brainless joy. The breakbeat house anthem Installation is his most commercial track yet: its female vocal, cut up into meaningless but wildly catchy syllables, is joined by the kind of central melody that lads chant on the way to an ill-advised bout of shirtless jetskiing. It\u2019s so appealing right across the summer dance scene \u2013 from pool party to sunlight-denying bunker \u2013 that you could run a sweepstake on how long it\u2019ll be until you hear it after entering the club.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nGrowing up in a mining family that that goes back generations, Mayor Mila Besich knew Oak Flat as the place where she attended union picnics as a girl and stood in a clearing to hear the World Series on her radio.\n\nNow, Besich is overseeing Superior\u2019s fight to to build a new copper project at Oak Flat amid worries about the town\u2019s economic future.\n\nToday, the national forest land in the heart of Arizona\u2019s \u201cCopper Corridor\u201d is scattered with 20 rustic campsites amid ancient oaks and a hand-painted sign that reads: \u201cProtect Oak Flat, Holy Land.\u201d Buried deep underground is the world\u2019s third-largest deposit of copper ore, big enough to yield 40 billion pounds (18 billion kilograms) of the metal over 60 years.\n\nCompeting interests have ignited a tug of war between the town of about 3,000 people who want a huge copper mine built there for its economic benefits, and Native American groups that consider the land sacred and are fighting to protect it from disturbance.\n\n\u201cOur town is going to be the most affected,\u201d said the mayor. \u201cWhat about our culture?\u201d\n\nResolution Copper Mining, a joint subsidiary of UK and Australian mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP, hopes to build one of the world\u2019s largest underground copper mines at the site outside Superior, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) east of Phoenix. Managing partner Rio Tinto says the mine could satisfy a quarter of growing U.S. demand for copper used in electric vehicles and smartphones.\n\nResolution began the permitting process nearly a decade ago, but the project has been delayed amid legal and political wrangling between U.S. agencies and the nonprofit Apache Stronghold, which challenges a planned land swap that would make the project possible. The full U.S. 9th District Court of Appeals is considering Apache Stronghold\u2019s request to permanently halt the project, but the only thing stopping it now is the lack of a new environmental impact statement.\n\nTwo other lawsuits challenging the initial environmental review, one filed by the San Carlos Apache Tribe and the other by environmental groups, have gone nowhere since the U.S. government pulled the impact statement for more consultations.\n\nOak Flat is on Tonto National Forest property to be conveyed to Resolution under a land exchange Congress approved in a 2014 rider to a must-pass defense bill.\n\nThe congressional vote sparked outrage among some Apaches over the site that features ancient Emory oaks and their acorns and other plants they consider important to their culture and religion. Called Chi\u2019chil Bildagoteel, the site is about an hour\u2019s drive from the San Carlos Apache Reservation and has been used for girls\u2019 coming-of-age celebrations.\n\nRio Tinto has said it would keep the campground open during the mine\u2019s first decades of operation. But Oak Flat could eventually collapse into an 1.8-mile (2.8-kilometer) crater when massive amounts of rock are removed from below.\n\nWendsler Nosie, a former San Carlos Apache tribal chairman and longtime activist, is the face of the Save Oak Flat campaign. He earlier fought unsuccessfully to stop a major telescope project on a site in southeastern Arizona that Apaches consider sacred: Mount Graham, or Dzil Nchaa S\u00ed\u2019an.\n\nNosie said he believes many townspeople quietly back his fight, but \u201cthey cannot openly show their support for me.\u201d\n\nWhen he was recently confronted in an area restaurant by a mining company employee who accused him of endangering jobs, development and good schools, \u201cI stood up and talked about how I\u2019m fighting for land, the water, the earth, religion and our children,\u201d he said, prompting a group of diners to applaud and pay for his dinner.\n\nWhile the San Carlos Apache leadership opposes the mine, some tribe members support it for the jobs it could generate amid high unemployment on the reservation.\n\n\u201cOak Flat is not sacred,,\u201d said Karen Kitcheyan-Jones, 64, a member who lives on the reservation. \u201cThere are many places on the reservation where we can gather acorns and have ceremonies.\u201d\n\nBrenda Astor, Resolution\u2019s principal adviser for Native affairs and a San Carlos Apache member, noted that dozens of other enrolled members also work for the mining company.\n\nAmid strong opposition to the project by some tribes and others, the Forest Service withdrew Resolution\u2019s original environmental impact statement for Oak Flat two years ago for additional consultations. No time frame has been announced. But once a new review is published, the formal transfer process can begin unless a federal court halts it.\n\nU.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona reintroduced legislation in March seeking to stop the land transfer, but it has not gained traction in Congress.\n\nRio Tinto says the mine would would help create 3,700 jobs over the course of the project and boost state and local tax revenues by $88 million to $113 million a year.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot for a town still clawing back economically after the Magma copper mine first shut down in 1982, later opened for a few years, then closed for good in 1996. The closure devastated a community so small that it has no stoplight and can be traversed by car in just over three minutes.\n\nSuperior was originally established in 1882 as the town of Hastings when the big mine was the Silver King, producing silver. The former mining towns of Globe and Miami are nearby, burrowed into mountains studded with saguaro cactus.\n\nToday, Superior still embraces its labor roots, a Democratic island in predominantly Republican Pinal County, said Besich, herself a Democrat.\n\nMore than a quarter of the town\u2019s residents live below the poverty line. Nearly 70% of the population is Hispanic, largely descendants of mining families who immigrated from Mexico or already worked in the area when it was still part of Mexico until the mid-1800s.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t cross the border, it crossed us,\u201d said Manny Guzman, whose family in the area goes back seven generations. His ancestor Manuelita Guzman (1844\u20131916) is buried in the Historic Pinal Cemetery, also the resting place of Wyatt Earp\u2019s common-law wife, Mattie Earp.\n\nGuzman, president of the nonprofit economic development corporation Rebuild Superior, said he remains hopeful the mine will prevail, but finds the delays frustrating after spending innumerable hours debating the environmental review.\n\n\u201cThere have been so many studies, so many roundtables,\u201d he said.\n\nThe talks have secured important gains for Superior, like ensuring protection of the town\u2019s water supply and guaranteeing a minimum of $120 million in revenue to pay for police and fire services over the course of the project if it goes forward.\n\n\u201cWe have seen some pretty dramatic changes to the plan,\u201d said Vicky Peacey, Resolution\u2019s president and general manager. \u201cIt\u2019s important that a lot of voices are heard.\u201d\n\nRio Tinto also agreed to permanently protect Apache Leap, the town\u2019s backdrop where local legend says some 75 Apaches leapt 400 feet (122 meters) to their death in the early 1870s rather than surrender to the U.S. cavalry.\n\nTown manager Todd Pryor said Resolution provided $2.25 million to help buy the old brick Superior High School that\u2019s being renovated to house the town hall, a library and activities for seniors, and threw in another $1.29 million for an enterprise center to develop future entrepreneurs and teach people trades like welding.\n\nOfficials in a town used to boom and bust cycles say they know they need to diversify their economy and can\u2019t count only on Resolution and its mine for their future.\n\nThey are developing local tourism, every March hosting a popular Apache Leap Mining Festival that includes a parade, chihuahua races and a mining competition with hand-sawing and jackleg drilling contests. Hundreds visit the town each August for the Prickly Pear Festival, with cactus fruit ice cream and margaritas.\n\nBut in a state the produces 70% of the nation\u2019s copper, and in a town where nearly everyone\u2019s parents and grandparents worked for the mines, the biggest bets for the future are on the extraction of ore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in our DNA,\u201d Cartier, the chamber president, said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAP writer Deepa Bharath reported from Oak Flat, Arizona.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Records are falling as temperatures soar, and millions of people are left clamoring for relief.\n\nThe country's preeminent desert city has long sweltered through such brutal heat. And there are lessons to be learned from people who live in a city so hot it's named after the mythical bird that was born from flames.\n\nHere are some of the ways residents in metropolitan Phoenix have learned to adapt to unruly heat.\n\nAIR CONDITIONING \u2013 A HOT COMMODITY\n\nPhoenix backyards are a symphony of humming and whirring beginning in the spring as monster A/C units rattle to life.\n\nAir conditioning is so vital in the desert that cities such as Phoenix, Tempe and Scottsdale have adopted cooling ordinances, which require landlords to keep temperatures in rental homes below a certain threshold.\n\nUnits usually are installed on rooftops with the help of cranes.\n\n\u201cMy air conditioner right now is running almost all the time,\" said longtime Scottsdale resident Naomi Evelan. \"And I\u2019m worried because when I have it set on 80, for example, it actually doesn\u2019t get beyond 82 ... It\u2019s working really hard.\u201d\n\nBURNING HOT\n\nIf the sidewalk is hot enough to fry an egg, it\u2019s certainly hot enough to burn human feet. Last year, the Arizona Burn Center recorded 85 admissions from heat-related burns in the summer months.\n\nSomeone can faint from the heat or suffer any other medical emergency and burn themselves on hot asphalt, according to Dr. Geoff Comp, an attending emergency medicine physician.\n\nThe damage, including blistering and skin sloughing off, can happen within minutes, Comp says.\n\nHow do people avoid the ER? By wearing protective layers of clothing and understanding their own limits outside.\n\nFoam handles protect vulnerable hands from hot metal knobs on exterior doors. Pet owners outfit their furry friends in booties to keep their paws from getting singed.\n\nGETTING SHADY\n\nArizona sizzles through more than 300 sunny days annually. Beyond slathering on sunscreen, desert dwellers have other ways to keep the UV at bay.\n\nSome install shade screens on their windows at home \u2014 solar shades block ultraviolet light and are a booming business around Phoenix.\n\nCar windows are tinted, shade structures tower over grocery store parking spaces, and it\u2019s rare to see a playground without a sunshade stretching over it.\n\nThere's also natural shade, better known as trees. Electric utility Salt River Project offers its customers free shade trees for their property if they sit through a Zoom course.\n\nMesquites, palo verdes and the desert willow are among the species that offer quick-growing, sun-thwarting canopies.\n\nPhoenix and Tempe have tree and shade master plans with designs to cover a quarter of their cities in shade.\n\nSome diehard sun avoiders will wear gloves while driving, with the added benefit of protection from a potentially scalding steering wheel.\n\nEARLY BIRDS\n\nOne of the best ways to avoid the sun is to get up before it rises. Dog parks fill before dawn with panting pets. Runners pound the pavement as cyclists sweep by on the trails in the early morning hours. Golf balls clank off clubs before most people's alarms buzz them awake.\n\n\u201cWe rearrange our schedule,\" said Heather Moos, who has lived in the area for 22 summers, and was heading home from the dog park before 7 a.m. Tuesday. \"We\u2019re up before the sun comes up. Basically we get to the dog park about 5:00 in the morning.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of things, some desert hot spots stay open in the dark. The Desert Botanical Garden hosts flashlight nights, when guests can wander the gardens under the stars. Nighthawks soar overhead while scorpions fluoresce under ultraviolet lights.\n\nThe Boyce Thompson Arboretum has similar events that also feature Arizona's nocturnal critters.\n\n\u201cI guess we have to be vampires in this kind of weather,\u201d Moos said.\n\nFINDING AN OASIS\n\nPools are as much a part of the Phoenix landscape as the saguaro cactus. But in scalding temps, they can turn to bathwater.\n\nCompanies can install cooling systems to chill the waters, but there are simpler methods. Aerators spray water above the pool to keep them cool.\n\nMisters that spritz water to cool diners are a common sight outside restaurants as well.\n\nLongtime resident Sandy Fam wears a wet towel around her neck to keep cool.\n\n\u201cI've been doing that for years,\u201d she said.\n\nBut while Fam lives in relative comfort, she worries about those who don't.\n\n\u201dYou know, I feel for people who struggle with\u201d paying for air conditioning. They're the ones really suffering, she said.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1082, "llama_token_count": 1338}, {"source_name": "Independent", "author": "Chris Wilson", "title": "7 Caribbean islands where hurricane season won\u2019t impact your holiday", "description": "From ever-popular Barbados to lesser-known Dutch islands, these are the best Caribbean options for avoiding the hurricane belt", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/central-america-caribbean/caribbean-islands-holidays-avoid-hurricanes-b2365796.html", "text": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discounts Get Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The island is home to a unique blend of Dutch architecture, European and Creole cultural influences and untainted natural beauty. These are all showcased in the capital, Willemstad: colourful colonial buildings line the streets and the waterfront in the Punda district, while beaches such as Mambo and Parasasa provide seaside relaxation and locals communicate in Papiamentu (a language influenced by colonial-era Portuguese and Spanish).\n\nUnsurprisingly considering the setting, many of the \u2018things to do\u2019 on the rest of the island consist of visiting beaches (Cas Abao and Kleine Knip are highly rated) and other natural sites including the Shete Boka National Park and the Hato Caves, although Willemstad offers plenty of opportunities to learn about the island\u2019s history and culture.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Avila Beach Hotel is located just five minutes\u2019 drive from the centre of Willemstad and has its own section of pristine private beach, as well as an outdoor swimming pool.\n\nRooms available from{{#price}}{{price}}per night{{/price}} {{^price}}Check availability for dates and prices{{/price}} Check availability Rates provided by Booking.com Hotel Amenities {{#amenities.foodDrink.length}} Food & Drink {{#amenities.foodDrink}} {{.}} {{/amenities.foodDrink}}\n\n{{/amenities.foodDrink.length}} {{#amenities.internet.length}} Internet Please check hotel for more information on amenities {{#amenities.internet}} {{.}} {{/amenities.internet}}\n\n{{/amenities.internet.length}} {{#amenities.services.length}} Services {{#amenities.services}} {{.}} {{/amenities.services}}\n\n{{/amenities.services.length}} {{#amenities.parking.length}} Parking Please check hotel for more information on amenities {{#amenities.parking}} {{.}} {{/amenities.parking}}\n\n{{/amenities.parking.length}} {{#amenities.health.length}} Health & Wellbeing {{#amenities.health}} {{.}} {{/amenities.health}}\n\n{{/amenities.health.length}} {{/amenities}} {{#amenities}}{{/amenities}}\n\nBonaire\n\nThe Dutch island of Bonaire is well-known for its local wildlife and scuba diving opportunities (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThe least populated of the Lesser Antilles, Bonaire lies 50 miles off the coast of Venezuela \u2013 in other words, comfortably outside of the hurricane belt. Its capital is Kralendijk, with many colourful buildings giving it Dutch colonial character. The island has a reputation for being a fantastic destination for wildlife spotting (both on land and in the sea) and scuba diving (mainly due to long-term preservation efforts that have been running since the 1970s).\n\nThe Washington Slagbaai National Park is the main on-land attraction, where visitors can see protected birds (such as the yellow-shouldered parrot) and a range of flora and fauna. The Pekelmeer Flamingo Sanctuary is also popular, being one of only four areas in the world where the birds breed, but tourists have to spot the birds from afar. The National Marine Park \u2013 a Unesco Heritage Site \u2013 is one of the world\u2019s oldest marine reserves, encircling the entire island and offering spectacular diving and snorkelling opportunities; it carries a $40 nature fee to aid preservation efforts. With an area of roughly 10 square miles and reefs that extend 300 metres offshore, the reserve is home to a range of local species, from turtles and sea horses to reef sharks.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nThe Bellafonte offers contemporary, luxury accommodation and a private pier area with direct access to the sea, and even a private coral reef area for scuba diving.\n\nRooms available from{{#price}}{{price}}per night{{/price}} {{^price}}Check availability for dates and prices{{/price}} Check availability Rates provided by Booking.com Hotel Amenities {{#amenities.foodDrink.length}} Food & Drink {{#amenities.foodDrink}} {{.}} {{/amenities.foodDrink}}\n\n{{/amenities.foodDrink.length}} {{#amenities.internet.length}} Internet Please check hotel for more information on amenities {{#amenities.internet}} {{.}} {{/amenities.internet}}\n\n{{/amenities.internet.length}} {{#amenities.services.length}} Services {{#amenities.services}} {{.}} {{/amenities.services}}\n\n{{/amenities.services.length}} {{#amenities.parking.length}} Parking Please check hotel for more information on amenities {{#amenities.parking}} {{.}} {{/amenities.parking}}\n\n{{/amenities.parking.length}} {{#amenities.health.length}} Health & Wellbeing {{#amenities.health}} {{.}} {{/amenities.health}}\n\n{{/amenities.health.length}} {{/amenities}} {{#amenities}}{{/amenities}}\n\nRead more on Central American and Caribbean travel:\n\nAruba\n\nAn aerial view of Aruba\u2019s Baby Beach (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThe smallest of the ABC islands, Aruba is said to have the most sunny days of any island in the entire Caribbean.

This is the destination for best experiencing the country\u2019s mix of African, Indian and Caribbean cultures, from Hindu statues to Caribbean music and cuisine.\n\nTrinidad also boasts its fair share of tropical rainforest, wildlife and natural wonders, such as the chance to see a scarlet ibis at Caroni Swamp.

Until recently many thought the plants were perfectly adapted to high temperatures and drought. Arizona's heat wave is testing those assumptions.\n\nCacti need to cool down at night or through rain and mist. If that does not happen they sustain internal damage. Plants now suffering from prolonged, excessive heat may take months or years to die, Hernandez said.\n\nCacti in Phoenix are being studied as the city is a heat island, mimicking higher temperatures plants in the wild are expected to face with future climate change, Hernandez said.\n\n(Reporting By Liliana Salgado, writing by Andrew Hay; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "tiktoken_token_count": 362, "llama_token_count": 447}, {"source_name": "Wallpaper*", "author": "Carole Dixon", "title": "Trinidad Circle brings sustainable thinking to a Palm Springs home", "description": "Trinidad Circle by Framework and Studio AR+D is a luxurious and sustainable Palm Springs home", "url": "https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/trinidad-circle-framework-palm-springs-usa", "text": "Wallpaper* Newsletter Receive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from around the world direct to your inbox Name: Your Email Address Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Thank you for signing up to Wallpaper.

The residence champions sustainable architecture with a nod to Palm Springs' modernist architecture legacy \u2013 which has birthed events such as the annual Palm Springs Modernism Week.\n\n(Image credit: Lance Gerber)\n\nTrinidad Circle by Studio AR+D and Framework\n\nWhen Laughlin bought the plot of land several years ago, it came with a special added bonus of conceptual drawings and plans for a three-bedroom home by Studio AR+D. While the original plans were used for the lot, Laughlin made his own modifications, including the expansion to a five-bedroom dwelling, while maximising the prime location with San Jacinto Mountain views.\n\n(Image credit: Lance Gerber)\n\n'I am proud to have designed and built a house that minimises its environmental impact and contributes to a more sustainable future,' he said. To that end, boulders from the grounds were excavated and repurposed for exterior landscaping. Other eco-conscious decisions include high-density eco-spray foam insulation, which helps retain the inside temperature, and rooftop solar panels to offset energy consumption.\n\n(Image credit: Lance Gerber)\n\nWhile the home was built with locally sourced materials, luxurious custom touches were not spared. A massive pivot front door \u2013 made by Cooper Reynolds Gross \u2013 sets the interior tone, made with white oak and brass, along with mesh in the glass for a bit of privacy while letting the light in.\n\n(Image credit: Lance Gerber)\n\nDurable and natural touches such as Hemlock tongue and groove ceilings are used throughout the space. When you want to head into the courtyard, the indoor-outdoor living room glass pocket doors slide into the wall for an easy flow to the saltwater pool surrounded by yuccas, cactus, and Mexican feather grass.\n\n(Image credit: Lance Gerber)\n\nFor the interior architecture and design, Laughlin partnered with Rachel Bullock at Los Angeles-based LAUN Studio, who was inspired by the circular shape of the home and traditional architecture of the area.\n\n(Image credit: Lance Gerber)\n\nLaughlin and Bullock visited three stone yards in Palm Springs and worked with local fabricators. 'We built palates off of the stones we found,' she said. One result was the Quartz in the kitchen and the blue-green mid-century modern colour palate. A variety of Zia Tiles are also used liberally throughout the home.\n\n(Image credit: Lance Gerber)\n\nFor the furnishings, plenty of LA designers were represented. There are Christopher Norman side tables, a bench by Objects for Objects, and Block Shop rugs, which mingle nicely with vintage pieces from a Ligne Roset cognac leather sectional sofa to a 1970s Bellini marble dining table.\n\n(Image credit: Lance Gerber)\n\nframeworkmade.com\n\nstudio-ard.com", "tiktoken_token_count": 733, "llama_token_count": 921}, {"source_name": "The Daily Dot", "author": "Phil West", "title": "\u2018Ordering a water and a coke\u2019: Former Texas Roadhouse server shares customer requests that annoy her", "description": "A former Texas Roadhouse server revealed a long list of customer behaviors that annoyed her on the job from requests about senior citizen discounts to how people people ordered their steak. \n\n\nIn a video posted on Wednesday, TikTok creator @flabigailfartin, w\u2026", "url": "https://www.dailydot.com/news/texas-roadhouse-annoying-customer-requests/", "text": "A former Texas Roadhouse server revealed a long list of customer behaviors that annoyed her on the job from requests about senior citizen discounts to how people people ordered their steak.\n\nIn a video posted on Wednesday, TikTok creator @flabigailfartin, who the Daily Dot has covered in the past for her Texas Roadhouse-adjacent content, shared that she recently left her post at Texas Roadhouse, perhaps freeing her up to really let loose about the various annoyances she harbored about the job.\n\nAs of Thursday, her video has been viewed more than 54,000 times.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a rapid-fire of things that annoyed me as a server, particularly a server at Texas Roadhouse, because I no longer work there and I can say them now,\u201d she began.\n\nHer list of grievances included: \u201dAsking me if I can adjust the volume of the music, change the air conditioning or change the heat, asking me for extra lemons and Splenda in order to make your own lemonade\u2014 disgusting \u2014being oddly specific about the amount of ice that you want in your glass.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she said.\n\nFrom there, she teed off on grown men who registered disgust when she asked if they wanted mushrooms or onion on their steaks, customers who asked her to list all 20 sides, and asking for coleslaw even though, in her words, \u201cWe haven\u2019t had coleslaw for the past three years.\u201d\n\nShe was also tired of customers calling Texas Roadhouses\u2019 Cactus Blossom a Bloomin\u2019 Onion, the name of a popular delicacy offered at Outback Steakhouse.\n\nShe concluded by noting, \u201cI could continue this for the whole 10 minutes, but I won\u2019t because that would expose too much rage that I don\u2019t need to expose because that would be unhealthy.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Dot has reached out to the creator via TikTok comment.

They thrive in a wide variety of habitats, including where few other species can: a city center. I rarely point my lens toward pigeons, but I couldn\u2019t resist as this pair, perched under a pier, carefully groomed each other\u2019s feathers. Purposefully exposing for the brighter parts of the image, I used the shadowy environment to create a studio-like black background for these remarkable iridescent birds. I hadn\u2019t planned on photographing pigeons that day, but I\u2019m glad that this couple\u2019s beauty captured my attention.\n\nBird Lore: Many people tend to ignore pigeons, but admirers of these adaptable, fast-flying birds abound throughout history and include Charles Darwin. Originally native to parts of Europe, northern Africa, and southern Asia, Rock Pigeons have been domesticated for thousands of years, and escaped birds have established feral populations the world over. Pairs of Rock Pigeons stay together during all seasons and generally mate for life, with both sexes taking a full share of incubating their eggs and caring for their young.\n\nJudge\u2019s Take (Preeti Desai): When you take a minute to look closely at a pigeon, you\u2019ll see that they\u2019re quite beautiful. In the right light, their iridescent neck feathers appear to glow. This photo captures not only that beauty but also a behavior that many humans can identify with: The pair are allopreening, an affectionate courtship behavior. I hope photos like this will lead to more appreciation for pigeons and other common birds we see daily.\n\nProfessional Award Winner: Shane Kalyn\n\nSpecies: Atlantic Puffin\n\nLocation: Westman Islands, Iceland\n\nCamera: Nikon D500 with a Nikon 500mm lens f/4; 1/6400 second at f/4; ISO 2000\n\nStory Behind the Shot: My wife and I were on a road trip in Iceland, and we took a ferry to the Westman Islands where we\u2019d heard there was a puffin colony. We pulled over at a beautiful spot to stretch our legs. There we saw a lone bird perched on the most amazing lava rock cliff, which was covered in colorful lichen and blooming wildflowers. It was raining and the sky was dark, creating a moody tone. I knew this moment was special: It was the first Atlantic Puffin I\u2019d seen, let alone been able to photograph.\n\nBird Lore: Puffins are popular birds, even though most people have never seen one. The Atlantic Puffin is widespread in the North Atlantic and adjacent areas of the Arctic Ocean, but Iceland is their epicenter: Up to 2 million pairs nest there, representing close to half the breeding population. Rising sea temperatures have reduced the availability of small fish that puffins need to feed their young, leading to major breeding failures at some Icelandic colonies.\n\nJudge\u2019s Take (Preeti Desai): This photo evokes a painting for me. I love the soft, pastel colors and especially how they pop against the gray backdrop. My eye immediately goes to the puffin because the white and orange stand out, and once I\u2019m done looking there, my eye easily roams around the rest of the photo. Another judge also pointed out that the upper rocks almost form a puffin head with a bill sticking out, and I love that. This is such a peaceful, pleasing moment.\n\nFemale Bird Prize: Sandra M. Rothenberg\n\nCategory: Amateur\n\nSpecies: Baltimore Oriole\n\nLocation: Warren, Pennsylvania\n\nCamera: Sony Alpha 1 with a Sony FE 200-600mm F/5.6\u20136.3 G OSS @459mm lens; 1/1000 second at f/6.3; ISO 1600\n\nStory Behind the Shot: Since I was a child, Baltimore Orioles have nested on our property. I have always loved watching the females: aerial acrobats that collect dried grasses and long gossamer strands of horsehair from my sister\u2019s adjacent farm. The birds use the materials to build their pendulous, pear-shaped nests. What miraculous feats of avian engineering! Once they arrive in May after their long migration north, I use a tiny blind to observe the birds without disturbing them. This female barely landed to grasp a tangled clump of horsehair and natural hemp and sisal fibers caught on a branch. She was surrounded by a lacy, fluttering, diaphanous veil. Off she flew into the woods with her prize trapped in her slender bill.\n\nBird Lore: In a marvel of instinct, the female Baltimore Oriole weaves a hanging pouch to provide a secure cradle for her eggs. A key to success is choosing the right materials, and she scours the surroundings for long, strong, flexible plant fibers to create a durable structure. If artificial fibers meet her standards, they\u2019re incorporated into the nest as well. The male will stop by to watch, but rarely helps. Construction usually takes at least a week, but some females have been known to complete the task in less than five days.\n\nJudge\u2019s Take (Purbita Saha): We usually see the grace and inventiveness that goes into a Baltimore Oriole\u2019s nest manifest in the final product. But in this photograph, we get to witness the female oriole literally wrapped up in the process. It conveys urgency and a healthy dose of whimsy, which is one my favorite ways to think about birds, female or not.\n\nAmateur Award Winner: Karen Blackwood\n\nSpecies: Chinstrap Penguin\n\nLocation: Cierva Cove, Antarctica\n\nCamera: Canon EOS R5 with a RF 70\u2013200mm f/2.8 L IS USM @200mm lens; 1/4000 second at f/8; ISO 1000\n\nStory Behind the Shot: On a stormy, snowy day, I was in a Zodiac touring an iceberg-filled cove. The rough water tossed the little rubber boat around. As I watched Gentoo Penguins leap onto the rocky shore and march to their nesting colony, I spotted a Chinstrap Penguin standing alone on a blue iceberg capped with fresh snow. It peered over the edge, and I knew it was going to jump. I adjusted my settings, keeping in mind the pitching boat, moving iceberg, and penguin that would soon be in midair. The bird jumped directly in front of me, diving straight into the water. I caught it just before it slipped beneath the waves and got both eyes and its perfect shape. I had captured a \u201cperfect 10\u201d of a dive. Wow!\n\nBird Lore: Contrary to their public image as birds of Antarctica, most of the 18 penguin species live in the south temperate zone. The Chinstrap Penguin is among the few true denizens of the zone of pack ice. Like many penguins, Chinstraps feed primarily on the small shrimplike crustaceans called krill, often pursuing them more than 50 feet below the sea surface. The long tail of this species, noticeable in this photo, probably helps it maneuver when swimming underwater.\n\nJudge\u2019s Take (Melissa Hafting): This photographer brilliantly captured the stark contrast of the mostly black penguin against its blue, melting sea-ice landscape. The diving bird\u2019s eyes are visible, and everything is sharp and in focus. Beyond technical merits, this photo evokes a lot of emotion in me. Chinstrap Penguins are having a difficult time adapting to a warming climate\u2014just like the Indigenous peoples and northern communities who have contributed little to climate change but are experiencing the worst of its effects. It\u2019s easy for people in far-away cities to ignore these problems. But these penguins are an indicator species that everyone must pay attention to. If the sea ice melts away, everyone is affected. The photo is a good reminder how we are all so connected.\n\nVideo Award Winner: Steven Chu\n\nSpecies: Short-eared Owl\n\nLocation: Shawangunk Grasslands National Wildlife Refuge, Wallkill, New York\n\nCamera: Nikon Z9 with Nikon NIKKOR Z 800mm f/6.3 VR S lens; 1/320 second at f/8; ISO 900\n\nStory Behind the Shot: I\u2019ve spent the past four winters setting out every free moment to document Short-eared Owls. They survey the grasslands for voles close to sunset, but many times the birds don\u2019t come out at all or are too far away. On this day, at the end of the trail, I heard an owl call. I saw another fly quickly to the first. The birds locked talons and cartwheeled downward, releasing each other just before hitting the ground. I\u2019d never seen this before. It was my lucky day!\n\nBird Lore: Most owls are creatures of mystery, lurking in dense forest and calling at night. The Short-eared is a delightful exception. It forages by flying low over marshes, prairies, and other open habitats, often in daylight, making it easier to observe. Its range across five continents adds to its everyman\u2019s owl aura. Local concentrations may develop in winter where prey are abundant. When several birds converge on a field, frequent but brief clashes may ensue.\n\nJudge\u2019s Take (Rina Miele): The videos I selected were very intentional. They demonstrated the videographer was actively engaged and took advantage of the moving-image medium. Action was key, especially the photographers\u2019 ability to capture difficult or spontaneous events: Short-eared Owls fight and bicker and engage each other in combat, but this spiral is one of the best I\u2019ve seen. Capturing this was certainly an amazing achievement.\n\nPlants for Birds Award Winner: Linda Scher\n\nPhotographer: Amateur\n\nSpecies: Verdin\n\nLocation: Sweetwater Wetlands, Tucson, Arizona\n\nCamera: Nikon Z9 with a Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 500mm f/5.6E PF ED VR lens; 1/400 second at f/7.1; ISO 640\n\nStory Behind the Shot: I birded the Sweetwater Wetlands while visiting Tucson and saw Verdins for the first time. At the far end of the site, I found a pair building a nest in a cane cholla. Given how tiny the birds are, I was surprised by the nest\u2019s large size. Four weeks later, I came back with friends. Using long lenses to stay distant, we photographed the busy pair gathering insects and caterpillars for their chicks. I love this image because it captures the Verdin\u2019s high energy, its desert habitat, and the protection that cacti offer.\n\nBird Lore: A tiny desert dweller of the Southwest and Mexico, the Verdin is unique in the Americas. Its closest relatives in Africa and Eurasia are best known for building elaborate nests, and the Verdin is equally impressive. Its nest is a large globular structure with an entrance low on one side. An outer layer of thorny twigs surrounds inner layers of much softer materials: leaves, grasses, plant down, fur, feathers, and spiderwebs. Verdins often build in spiny plants, which help to deter predators.\n\nJudge\u2019s Take (Marlene Pantin): In this photo we see the role that native plants such as cacti play in providing critical food and shelter for birds\u2014even in the harshest environments. The photograph also does an exceptional job of capturing the contrast between the large cane cholla and tiny Verdin. I am struck by how the cactus seems to envelop the bird, providing a sense of care and protection for it. The wonderful mix of textures and vibrant and muted colors add gravity to the photo.\n\nYouth Award Winner: Kieran Barlow\n\nSpecies: Dunlin\n\nLocation: Barnegat Light, New Jersey\n\nCamera: Nikon D850 with a Tamron SP 150-600mm F/5\u20136.3 Di VC USD G2 @240mm lens; 1/3200 second at f/5.6; ISO 560\n\nStory Behind the Shot: On a winter trip to New Jersey, my goal was to capture images of Harlequin Ducks. Instead, I became enraptured by a flock of sandpipers feeding on the rocks. They would all fly out of the way when a wave crashed onto shore, so I hunkered down between boulders and waited. It was a challenge not to fall between the wet, seaweed-covered rocks into the water. After more than an hour of unsuccessful attempts, I picked out a nearby sandpiper and hoped it would take flight. As a wave crashed, the entire flock took to the air. I eagerly reviewed my photos: I had finally captured a Dunlin as it narrowly avoided being dragged into the sea.\n\nBird Lore: The 24 sandpipers in the genus Calidris are all migratory, and many evade winter by flying to the southernmost reaches of the southern continents. But Dunlins buck the trend, migrating only short to medium distances from their northern high-latitude breeding areas. In North America, flocks of this hardy sandpiper winter along coastlines north to Canada and southern Alaska, often on rocky shorelines pounded by the surf.\n\nJudge\u2019s Take (Melissa Hafting): This shot is a spectacular feast for the eyes, and it also tells a story. The photographer caught the bird as it jumped up and both the water and Dunlin are perfectly frozen in motion. You can feel the crashing waves and the mossy wet rock. I can almost hear the bird\u2019s wings flapping, and the chattering it would have made when it was disturbed from roosting or feeding. Hopefully this image makes people want to protect intertidal habitats on wintering and migration grounds where these shorebirds rest and feed.\n\nFisher Prize: Sunil Gopalan\n\nSpecies: Brown Pelican\n\nLocation: Gal\u00e1pagos National Park, Ecuador\n\nCamera: Canon EOS R3 with a Canon EF 100\u2013400mm f/4.5\u20135.6L IS II USM @100mm lens; 1/200 second at f/4.5; ISO 25,600\n\nStory Behind the Shot: On a cruise in the Gal\u00e1pagos with my family, my kids called for me. The lights of the docked boat had attracted many fish. This, in turn, drew several Gal\u00e1pagos sharks and a Brown Pelican. An interaction of species like that is a photo opportunity. The pelican would jump out of the water when the shark got close, so I hoped to time my shots to get both in the frame. After a couple of hours, I was able to photograph a few interactions. In this image, the shark swims under the bird, creating a ghostly silhouette. I didn\u2019t know if this sort of photograph was common, but for me, it was special.\n\nBird Lore: Small fish near the sea surface must be aware of predators from above and below. In offshore waters from the United States to the Gal\u00e1pagos, Brown Pelicans are among the main aerial threats, plunging into the waves headfirst to scoop up fish in an expandable bill pouch. Adult pelicans have little to fear from other creatures while in the air, but on water they, too, must stay alert for the odd shark attack.\n\nJudge\u2019s Take (Morgan Heim): This image is like a present that you get to open over and over again. The light and curves are so elegant as to be painterly, but as you look longer you realize the layers of story. The Brown Pelican appears to sense something below it, and its bowed head prompts you to linger longer. You realize its reflection in the water is not only a reflection. The shark curving just beneath the pelican\u2019s body completes a perfect arc, melding into each other. Did the shark attack or simply swim by? Our minds run wild. The moment could have easily been missed, and it is a prime example of a photographer composing a dramatic juxtaposition that pays homage to two species\u2019 lives. It teaches us to notice subtleties.\n\nYouth Honorable Mention: James Fatemi\n\nSpecies: Green-winged Teal\n\nLocation: Huntley Meadows Park, Alexandria, Virginia\n\nCamera: Nikon Z9 with a Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 600mm f/4E FL ED VR lens and a Nikon Mount Adapter FTZ II; 1/320 second at f/4; ISO 400\n\nStory Behind the Shot: I enjoy taking pictures of wildlife in snow, but this winter was one of the least snowy on record. In late February, just as I was beginning to think the season would end with no snowfall, the forecast predicted flurries the next morning. I went to the marsh soon after sunrise and waited. These two Green-winged Teals were some of the only subjects in the marsh that day. After a few hours, they began their courtship ritual and mating just as large flakes started to fall. I hung my lens over the boardwalk to get a water-level view. The snow and smooth water created a serene image that I was happy to capture.\n\nBird Lore: Like many ducks, Green-winged Teals mostly pair up on their wintering grounds, with courtship behavior beginning by late fall. At first, courting is often a group activity, with up to two dozen males vying for the attention of one or more females. Courting males perform a variety of displays, with much bowing, headshaking, bill-pointing, short flights, and loud whistled calls. Ultimately the female chooses from among her suitors, and the mated pair migrate together to the breeding grounds. The male leaves after the female begins incubating eggs.\n\nJudge\u2019s Take (Sabine Meyer): I really like that this young photographer set out intentionally to capture this image in adverse weather, parlaying snowflakes and the gray overcast light into assets that created the cool mood of this mating scene. It\u2019s also a tender moment and unusual in that the female is nearly submerged except for her head. The colors on the male pop beautifully against the overall muted color palette.\n\nProfessional Honorable Mention: Liron Gertsman\n\nSpecies: Northern Hawk Owl\n\nLocation: Thompson-Nicola, British Columbia, Canada\n\nCamera: Canon EOS R5 with a Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5\u20135.6L IS II USM @400mm lens and Canon Mount Adapter EF\u2013EOS R; 1/500 second at f/5.6; ISO 500\n\nStory Behind the Shot: Despite my spending time in Northern Hawk Owl habitat over the years, my encounters with this elusive and stunning species were few and far between. My explorations had mostly been in summer, when the owls are locally scarce and harder to find. Eager to change my luck, I spent several days hiking and searching this winter. Even with my large snowshoes, I regularly sank to my knees in the deep, powdery snow. I was finally rewarded with several unforgettable encounters with a Northern Hawk Owl pair as they hunted and courted. I captured this image as one perched at the tip of a frosty tree.\n\nBird Lore: A unique owl with no close relatives, the Northern Hawk Owl ranges across boreal forest zones of Eurasia and North America, mostly staying far from human settlements. Adapted to the long light of northern summers, this owl is active by day year-round. Unlike owls that rely on sharp hearing to hunt by night, it watches for its prey, which consists mostly of voles in summer and some birds in winter. When it spots a target, the owl swoops in with fast, powerful wingbeats, suggesting the behavior of the Accipiter hawks, hence its name.\n\nJudge\u2019s Take (Sabine Meyer): Less is more for this photo of a Northern Hawk Owl: It exudes a peaceful, pared-down elegance built on a very limited color palette, and its shapes and lines easily draw the eye to the crowning jewel at the tip of the frosty tree. I like that the dramatic composition achieves a perfect visual balance, even though the tree limbs are not fanning out in total symmetry. And there is something ghostly yet magical about the bird that appears to stare us down.\n\nPlants for Birds Honorable Mention: Vicki Santello\n\nCategory: Amateur\n\nSpecies: Tree Swallow\n\nLocation: Atchafalaya National Heritage Area, Louisiana\n\nCamera: Canon EOS-1D X Mark III with Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 IS @140mm lens and a Canon Extender EF 1.4x III; 1/800 second at f/8; ISO 1250\n\nStory Behind the Shot: I was enjoying the quiet of a secluded sunrise in my kayak when I heard a loud hum. I couldn\u2019t imagine what could make such a persistent sound. My ears guided me to the source: thousands of Tree Swallows hunting insects on the wing and water surface. Their collective wing-beating generated the noise. As I got closer, I had a second wondrous realization: The swallows that were not actively hunting rested on bare, old-growth bald cypress trees; the birds crowded together so tightly that the branches looked as if they had leaves. I let my kayak drift and began to shoot, experimenting with focal lengths and angles until the flock burst up as one and departed.\n\nBird Lore: Aerial insectivores like swallows and swifts forage in flight, nabbing insects in midair as they sweep gracefully over open fields or water. Unlike swifts, which may stay on the wing continuously, swallows rest on convenient perches when they can. These stately bald cypress, iconic trees of southeastern swamps, give the Tree Swallows access to a prime feeding area: a wide-open bayou, where insect swarms often gather low over the water\u2019s surface.\n\nJudge\u2019s Take (Marlene Pantin): On first glance, it appears that the limbs of the Bald Cypress, a native tree, are dotted with leaves. Only on closer inspection is it obvious that birds cover the branches, adding so much fullness to the trees. With the backdrop of the sky, water, and horizon, and the beautiful, serene colors that blend seamlessly into each layer, this photo appears to be a painting rather than a photograph. It is very calming, and as such, draws you in.\n\nAmateur Honorable Mention: Nathan Arnold\n\nSpecies: Reddish Egret\n\nLocation: San Carlos Bay\u2013Bunche Beach Preserve, Fort Myers, Florida\n\nCamera: Sony Alpha 1 with a Sony FE 400mm f/2.8 GM OSS lens; 1/2000 second at f/2.8; ISO 640\n\nStory Behind the Shot: At sunrise, when the tide was low, I kayaked to a local spot where Reddish Egrets fish. Heavy fog obscured the sun, creating a yellow-orange light. The scene felt surreal. It\u2019s amazing to capture the craziness of this bird\u2019s feeding behavior\u2014how they stab their bills into the water, jump, and flap. I took this photo as the light over my shoulder illuminated water droplets and a small fish, right as the egret flipped its breakfast into its bill.\n\nBird Lore: The Reddish Egret is famous for its wildly varied feeding repertoire. Individuals may stand in one spot, walk slowly, or dash about, lurching side to side, stirring the water with their feet, abruptly spreading and closing their wings. All the action serves to startle fish into moving. Nabbing its prey, the egret expertly tosses it up to reposition it before swallowing it whole.\n\nJudge\u2019s Take (Sabine Meyer): A decisive moment perfectly captured! There are so many elements coming together in this photo: the Reddish Egret glowing in the misty light of the rising sun; the fish suspended vertically in the air just before it is swallowed; the water\u2019s motion frozen in the beak\u2019s opening and the droplets shimmering against the golden backdrop. To top it all, the reddish light beautifully matches the bird\u2019s neck and belly.\n\nVideo Honorable Mention: Steven Chu\n\nCategory: Amateur\n\nSpecies: Osprey\n\nLocation: Millville, New Jersey\n\nCamera: Nikon Z9 with a Nikon NIKKOR 800mm F/5.6E FL ED VR lens; 1/320 second at f/5.6; ISO 64\n\nStory Behind the Shot: At this dam, I can capture Ospreys pulling fish from the water at eye level. But I have to walk down large, unstable rocks; I remember this day vividly because I nearly tumbled down. Luckily, I landed safely, and I set up on the water\u2019s edge. The cloudy day and low tide allowed me to shoot for six hours without worrying about shadows. Ospreys like to fly into the wind, and with the wind at my back, the conditions were ideal. I finally got a video of an Osprey grabbing a large fish and flying directly toward me, its eyes trained on my lens. Now when I return, I use my tripod as a walking stick to help me navigate the rocks.\n\nBird Lore: Osprey hunting behavior is a feat of skill and strength: soaring or hovering over the water, plunging feet first to grasp a fish from just below the surface, then lifting it and flying away. They are known to capture and carry fish that are more than half their own weight. Tales of \u201cfish hawks\u201d being dragged underwater and drowned after snagging large prey are almost certainly false; the Osprey will simply let go of a too-heavy load.\n\nJudge\u2019s Take (Mick Thompson): There are so many things to love about this video. The videographer was not only able to get in close on the bird but also found a way to shoot at eye level. The Osprey shows off its powerful wings as it rises out of the water with such a heavy load. I was impressed with the videographer\u2019s ability to keep the Osprey in focus, which is often difficult when birds are flying towards you. I love the detail we can see in the bird and the fish as we marvel at the Osprey\u2019s ability to hang on. The small waterfall in the background enhances the composition.", "tiktoken_token_count": 5838, "llama_token_count": 7017}, {"source_name": "The Quietus", "author": "JR Moores", "title": "Columnfortably Numb: Psych Rock For July Reviewed By JR Moores", "description": "After some words of warning for The Fab Two, JR Moores gets down to more pressing psychedelic concerns, and reviews new releases from King Gizzard, Dead Sea Apes, Yawning Man and more", "url": "https://thequietus.com/articles/33122-king-gizzard-the-lizard-wizard-dead-sea-apes-mike-vest-the-beatles", "text": "Bobby Lee by Gemma Rayner\n\nDon't get me wrong, I adore The Beatles as much as the next Anthology-smitten child of left-wing boomers. BUT LEAVE IT NOW, PAUL. As someone who remembers the simplicity of life before broadband and Wi-Fi, I remain suspicious of most non-medical advances in technology because it tends to lead to antisocial behaviour in train carriages, cinemas and theatres (such as talking). PLEASE DON'T DO THIS, PAUL. We're told that that \"the final Beatles song\" has been completed using artificial intelligence to \"extricate\" John Lennon's voice from a demo cassette. SIR, PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR AND STEP AWAY FROM THE VAULTS.\n\n'Free As A Bird' was okay. NOT BRILLIANT, THOUGH. Embellished from a home recording Lennon had made in 1977, The Beatles' 1995 \"comeback\" single did not match the timeless magic of the classics that'd been made when the band members were all still alive and on speaking terms. REALISTICALLY, IT COULDN'T. Jeff Lynne's clodhopping production didn't help, providing as it did that sense of accidental self-parody. SURE, GEORGE MARTIN WAS GOING DEAF AT THE TIME BUT HE'D NEVER HAVE GREENLIT THAT DRUM SOUND. Still, some listeners found the piece to be quite moving, partly due to the eeriness of hearing Lennon's ghostly voice accompanied once again by his ex-bandmates who were then at the riper age he'd been so cruelly denied. BY DEATH HE WAS ALSO DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO VETO ANYTHING HE MIGHT'VE DEEMED DISTASTEFULLY NAFF.\n\nThen there was the follow-up: 'Real Love'. REMEMBER THAT ONE, PAUL? Created again from scrappy tapes the surviving \"Threetles\" had received from Yoko Ono, and once again resembling ELO, 'Real Love' was an even damper squib, famously excluded from the Radio 1 playlist. NOT BECAUSE OF AGEISM, AS STATUS QUO INSISTED, BUT LARGELY BECAUSE IT WASN'T PARTICULARLY FAB. Plans to pad-out further Lennon home recordings didn't work out because George Harrison got in a grump (again) \u2014 HARE KRISHNA \u2014 and now he's gone too, so the democratic spirit of the band has shifted further to some Beatles (the living ones) being more equal than others. THERE'S NO NEED TO DWELL IN THE PAST, PAUL. MCCARTNEY III WAS EXCELLENT.\n\nReflecting later on 'Real Love', McCartney admitted, \"That was good to do but it was a bit like 'boiling your cabbages twice'. An old Liverpool expression you know\u2026 You do a thing that's so exciting, you do it again and the novelty's eroded.\" HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT, PAUL?\n\nEven if the AI is being used to extract and polish Lennon's vocals rather than creating a frighteningly accurate simulation of his voice singing some words he'd never chosen to, is this really worth doing? LET IT BE, PAUL! Now the cat's out of the bag, we face a boldly vanilla future where Fab Four avatars will bob their heads on the roof of the O2 Arena like the Broadway musical Beatlemania fused with that ABBA fiasco that's scheduled to run longer than The Mousetrap. THE TRICK IS TO KEEP THE BRAND ALIVE WITHOUT CHEAPENING IT\u2026 SOMEHOW. Entire new Beatles albums will soon be written collaboratively by T-1000 and Robocop. Imagine the violent fallout over any co-writing disagreements there. Just when we're gawping at whether the surprisingly blissful 'Good Afternoon Everlasting Radiance' should be credited to \"Robocop/T-1000\" or vice versa, that's when the mechanical bastards will strike and hook us all up to The Matrix. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT, MACCA?\n\n\"What's important about the Beatles is that the timing was good,\" said Pulp's Jarvis Cocker on hearing about 'Free As A Bird'. \"They stopped it just when they should have stopped it, and so their memory has not been violated in the same way that maybe the Rolling Stones' memory has been violated by some of the abominations that they've produced since then.\" Pulp have reformed twice since their split but haven't released any new music since 2001's We Love Life. The learned Mr Cocker ought to consider writing something into his will that'll prevent a Pulp tour of 2076 fronted by C-3PO.\n\nI am inclined, therefore, to agree with the majority on Twitter that a \"new\" Beatles song assisted by AI technology is the year's worst music-related idea this side of going to see Primal Scream ever again. SO HERE ARE SOME NEW RELEASES FROM ACTIVE PSYCH BANDS YET TO ENTER THE CURSED CREMATORIUM OF HOLOGRAMISATION.\n\nHozomeen \u2013 The Void\n\n(SuperFi)\n\nHozomeen is a new project from Graham Thompson who plays everything on The Void except the guest trumpet part. Thompson has been in a bunch of cult Newcastle bands including OZO, Gullich and the heroically named Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaind. Whereas his Sea Ninety project has an emo flavour, Thompson shoots for cathartically hefty alt-rock on this eight-part offering. Among many highlights is 'Lack' which basically boils the best two elements of Soundgarden \u2014 i.e. the groovesome riffs and vocal wailing \u2014 to their purest essence before segueing into almost classical territory. Elsewhere, 'One Kilohertz' is about as slow and sludgy as Harvey Milk with their ankles stuck in a peat bog. 'Balk' sounds like David Yow has been kicked out of The Jesus Lizard and replaced by the horn-parping ghost of Miles Davis. Another instrumental piece, 'Coursing', has a proggier feel and the final song is a little more darkly ambient than the rest. Quite the showcase.\n\nYawning Man \u2013 Long Walk Of The Navajo\n\n(Heavy Psych Sounds)\n\nI don't know what the longest gap is between a band forming and releasing their first album but Yawning Man must be contenders. Lynchpins of the Californian desert rock scene, they began playing together in 1986. The year of their studio debut? 2005! Dopesmokers can take a little while to get around to certain pressing matters but that's ridiculous. Working at their own pace, the band have now made it to album number six, although guitarist Gary Arce is the only remaining original member with even long-yawning bassist Mario Lalli no longer present, perhaps because they lost him around the back of a cactus or something. Joined by Billy Cordell and Bill Stinson, apropos of the album's title Arce is in no rush to get anywhere on these three long and improvised instrumentals. The music is heavy in a sense, with Stinson hardly holding back with the weight he puts on those skins. It also has a certain post-rocky elegance to it, thanks in part to the slow tempos and shimmering guitar effects. At times it's like listening to a surf-rock record at the wrong RPM, which is no bad thing.\n\nBobby Lee \u2013 Endless Skyways\n\n(Tompkins Square)\n\nBobby Lee looks and sounds like he's from a different time and country. Moustache. Long dark hair. Headband. Boots. Denim. He appears every bit the Californian 70s rock dude. As for his sound, it's in a similar vein to that of Nashville's William Tyler (whose recent live album with The Impossible Truth is well worth hearing), i.e. a comfortingly cosmic and relaxed-sounding yet technically impressive fusion of country, space rock and krautrock. This subgenre's been dubbed \"ambient Americana\", \"ambient country\" or \"kosmische pastoral\". It is having a moment right now, although you could trace its roots through Ry Cooder and Bruce Langhorne until you got all the way back to some original pedal steel player in the old west, off his head on some entheogens in a process inspired by the rituals of the native peoples. It's double-take time once you realise Lee is from Sheffield, a city with a musical history better known for The Human League, Heaven 17, Def Leppard and John Shuttleworth. Mind you, Alex Turner is from those parts and he's sounded worryingly American since about 2010. Authenticity? Authenschmicity! If this release had appeared on Three Lobed Recordings or Ryley Walker's Husky Pants and we'd been told someone from Rose City Band was behind it, not even Grayson Currin would've raised any doubts.\n\nKing Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard \u2013 PetroDragonic Apocalypse; Or, Dawn Of Eternal Night: An Annihilation Of Planet Earth And The Beginning Of Merciless Damnation\n\n(KGLW)\n\n\u2026or PDAODOENAAOPEATBOMD for short. This is a spiritual sequel to 2019's Infest The Rats' Nest by King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard (or KG&TLW, for short). That is to say KG&TLW have gone all thrash metal again to rip out another record full of brutal riffage, whip-sharp solos, firecracker drum fills and vocals that are a bit more growly than usual. That said, it was written in the same way as last year's Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms And Lava, with no preprepared ideas brought to the studio and everything emerging from the scratch of their jams. It's resulted in a proggier album than Infest The Rats' Nest with most songs longer than those on that new Metallica album. Crucially, though, these ones have a lot more ideas in them than 72 Seasons'.\n\nAs with much of KG&TLW's recent work, themes of imminent environment apocalypse loom large in the doomsaying lyrics, often via Godzilla-style metaphors. The story becomes clearest on the final side of the double-LP when the music retracts to mere ambient gurgles so that Leah Senior can resume her role as KG&TLW's chief narrator. As Gizzard honcho Stu Mackenzie explains of the concept: \"It's about humankind and it's about planet Earth but it's also about witches and dragons and shit.\" Just call him the Warhammer roleplayer's Greta Thunberg.\n\nArtifacts & Uranium \u2013 The Gateless Gate\n\n(Riot Season)\n\nLike King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, Newcastle's Mike Vest is more prolific than a speed-addled beat poet chained to the typewriter because he knows his days are numbered. Isn't this what musicians are supposed to do? Make their art and put-it-the-fuck-out. Not schmooze around backstage at the Springsteen show, launch their own insufferable podcast or advertise data bundles. Of the countless Vest-featuring projects out this quarter, Artifacts & Uranium sees him joined by Fred Laird (Earthling Society, Taras Bulba, Empty House, etc.) It's unclear which member identifies as the \"artifacts\" and who is the \"uranium\" but each musician contributes several instruments. There's one long 'n' dense jam on the first side of the LP and \u2014 lo and behold \u2014 another on the second. 'Twilight Chorus' is lively from the off and manages to build and build from that starting point. It's not quite as busy as Ozric Tentacles and remains tastefully skronkier. Still, it's approaching that fruity ballpark. Richard Pinhas is another touchpoint, as the guitar riffs, licks and distortion dance and writhe around synth patterns which appear to have minds of their own. The surprise comes about five minutes from the end when the maelstrom winds back to introduce the sound of a freaky choir, backed by pious-sounding organ chords and intermittent blasts of iconoclastic axe violence.\n\nOn 'Sound Of Desolation', the pair are joined by viola player Martin Ash. His string drones compliment those emanating from elsewhere, with the chaotic sonic swirliness locked down by the warm and hard-rocking authority of the bassline. Another aspect that's worth highlighting is Nigel Adams' vibrant artwork, full of trippy tentacles, bugeyes and gnashers. Stare at it in fixated wonder as the music launches you into alien dimensions.\n\nJegong \u2013 The Complex Inbetween\n\n(Pelagic)\n\nWith their Jegong project, Dahm Majuri Cipolla (MONO, Watter) and Reto Ma\u0308der (Sum Of R, Ural Umbo) take inspiration from the enduring influence of krautrock. They are named after a song by Dieter Moebius and Mani Neumeier. Listening to their music, names like Neu!, Can and Faust spring to mind. However, their multi-mooded homage to the tradition is interesting enough to counter any accusations of derivativeness. The duo are at pains to keep everything sounding \"organic\" and not too robotic or nonhuman. Cipolla's earthily recorded drumbeats help to achieve that, as do the in-moment decisions Ma\u0308der makes with his pile of guitars, synthesisers and whatever electronic boxes he's using to manipulate the sound of each.\n\nTheir second album kicks off with the propulsive 'Come To The Centre'. With 'Clear The Way', the record takes a more ominous tone, as if the pair decided to produce a heavier score to John Carpenter's Halloween. Despite the record's colourful sleeve and the press release's mention of psychedelic Wolds painter David Hockney, the atmosphere remains fairly dark with songs such as 'Former Wish' taking the form of a confrontational dirge. After that punishing experience, 'Focus Defocus' offers floatier and jazzy relief, introducing a more optimistic feel to the final leg of the experience.\n\nDead Sea Apes \u2013 Rewilding\n\n(Cardinal Fuzz)\n\nA few weeks ago I had the pleasure of witnessing Manchester's Dead Sea Apes support the American alt-rock legends Come. One of the most endearing things about the opening act was the way guitarist Brett Savage would punch the air with his fist at the end of each song as if he'd just made it through to the semi-final of Masterchef with a tastebud-tingling bowl of Pad Thai rather than impressed a pub-roomful of people with another phat portion of chest-rattling stoner rock. Their line-up has slimmed back down to a power trio for Rewilding, an album that doesn't mess around with its choice of opener. 'Denialist' boasts riffs thicker than Gregg Wallace and lead licks that lash at your throat like a chain-wielding biker.\n\nAt other moments, Dead Sea Apes permit themselves to meander a little more loosely and quieten down the mood in places before cranking everything back up to 11. Such contrast is illustrated by the fast, lively and playful 'Truther' which rattles out of the speakers after the preceding number, 'The Sleep Room', has offered nearly seven minutes of gloomier space rock. Some of the song titles suggest an indignancy with the post-facts world of misinformation, fake news and other assorted bullshit. With no vocals on offer, that could be open to interpretation.\n\nB\u00faho Ermita\u00f1o \u2013 Implosiones\n\n(Buh)\n\nB\u00faho Ermita\u00f1o formed in Lima on a mission to fuse krautrock with Andean folk. Really, that's selling short the breadth of their ideas and talent. Most of the songs have no vocals although the operatic theremin part on 'Ingravita' might as well be singing to us from space. 'Explosiones' is the one track with human vocals. Their tone, sung over such celestial rock, makes it sound as though Panda Bear has joined Eternal Tapestry. But who needs much singing anyway when, throughout, the instrumental melodies are so strong? They're Beatles-esque, I dare say, in certain places. (Specifically, the 1967 era.) Clearly, B\u00faho Ermita\u00f1o take great care in crafting these jams rather than tossing off any old porridge of distortion as some groups are prone. A little more dystopian than the lightness elsewhere, 'Entre Los Cerros' is dominated by an intense and almost foreboding synthesiser pattern. Over the top of that arrive expressive lead guitar licks and fevered drumming, as if providing South America's answer to Heldon's 'Jet Girl'. Suggesting it's going to be the most \"traditional\" sounding song, 'Renacer' opens with the delicately picked sound of the charango. Before long, it's accompanied by deep, wooziness-inducing bass and the kind of successive, mortality defying guitar solos of which Funkadelic would be proud.\n\nRumours that JR Moores is working on a book about Paul McCartney are yet to be confirmed", "tiktoken_token_count": 3584, "llama_token_count": 4319}, {"source_name": "Breitbart News", "author": "Frances Martel, Frances Martel", "title": "Following Failure of Government Hip-Hop, China Promotes Regime-Friendly Ghanaian Rapper", "description": "The Chinese state-run newspaper\u00a0Global Times published a feature promoting the career of Ghanaian-born, Chengdu-based rapper Foster Asare-Yeboah on Wednesday, a sign that the Communist Party is returning to its policy of promoting regime-friendly rap music af\u2026", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2023/07/06/following-failure-of-government-hip-hop-china-promotes-regime-friendly-ghanaian-rapper/", "text": "The Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times published a feature promoting the career of Ghanaian-born, Chengdu-based rapper Foster Asare-Yeboah on Wednesday, a sign that the Communist Party is returning to its policy of promoting regime-friendly rap music after attempting to ban hip-hop generally for years.\n\nFor much of 2015 and 2016, the Chinese Communist Party attempted to flood Chinese youth with government-produced hip-hop anthems about the greatness of communist bureaucracy, featuring samples of dictator Xi Jinping\u2019s speeches and cumbersome titles such as \u201cThe Four Comprehensives Rap\u201d and \u201cThe Reform Group Is Two Years Old.\u201d The Chinese public largely rejected the regime\u2019s attempts to enter the hip-hop industry, instead gravitating towards a growing scene of underground Chinese rappers inspired by their American counterparts and, as is traditional in the genre, writing songs about wealth and success.\n\nChinese hip-hop veered perilously close to mainstream culture, in the eyes of the Communist Party, after the debut of the reality program The Rap of China, in 2017. The show, which featured authentic Chinese rappers who had ascended in the scene independent of the government, became a blockbuster hit for the Chinese video platform iQiyi and launched the careers of several big-name Chinese rappers, most prominently the first season\u2019s winners, PG One and Gai.\n\nShortly after The Rap of China became popular, the Communist Party announced a ban on rap and similar \u201cimmoral\u201d music from television airwaves and scrambled to disappear or humiliate its stars. PG One was forced to apologize for being overly influenced by \u201cblack music;\u201d Rap of China judge Kris Wu was sentenced to 13 years in prison for alleged rape. Some rappers survived by posting messages supportive of China\u2019s human rights abuses against pro-democracy Hong Kong protesters and placating the regime, but the genre as it existed prior to the success of The Rap of China in the country largely ceased to exist.\n\nAsare-Yeboah, the Ghanaian rapper featured in the Global Times, does not appear to produce explicitly pro-regime music. His message in an interview with the Chinese state propaganda outlet, however, was one favorable to the regime\u2019s messaging that, under a communist interpretation of \u201cChinese culture\u201d that eschews individualism and highlights \u201charmony,\u201d even foreigners can succeed in the country. The Global Times emphasized that Asare-Yeboah published bilingual rap songs in Mandarin and English, sported a Sichuan accent, and adopted a Chinese name: Li Kui.\n\nThe outlet noted that Asare-Yeboah is also an alum of The Rap of China \u2013 its 2019 season, long after the Chinese government had cracked down on organic cultural content that could run afoul of communist orthodoxy on the show. It also highlighted songs celebrating China as superior to the rest of the world, with lyrics such as \u201cI have seen very many cities and landscapes, from New York to Brazil, [but] I only fell in love with Chengdu.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019m doing music, but I\u2019m not just talking about this industry. I feel like every kind of business outside and in China should work on communication because so many things can be done if they really come together to talk and share ideas, because present-day China is not the China from 30 years ago,\u201d Asare-Yeboah was quoted as saying. He reportedly credited China with teaching him \u201cnot to be selfish\u201d and how \u201cto be a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s [Chinese culture] all about family because no matter what anybody does, the first thing they think about is the family. The biggest change in my life after I came to China is that every time when I think about doing something, I don\u2019t just think about myself,\u201d the state newspaper quoted the rapper as saying. \u201cI think about the people around me; my wife, my kid, the people I work with, and the people I\u2019m doing business with, because we move together move as a team.\u201d\n\nThe Global Times noted that the rapper also used \u201ctypical Chinese features\u201d in his songs and rapping over Chinese-style music, a trend initially promoted by the blacklisted first season of The Rap of China.\n\nAsare-Yeboah first received Chinese state media attention in 2019, the year he appeared on The Rap of China, the subject of a photo essay about his life integrating in Chengdu.\n\nForster Asare-Yeboah from Ghana got millions of followers after posting videos on social networks of him speaking Sichuan dialect. \"I like to make people happy and I never expected I could have so many followers,\" he said with a laugh. https://t.co/fzjlcYJXmL pic.twitter.com/Ol8Lte5mET \u2014 China Daily (@ChinaDaily) February 9, 2019\n\nHe currently promotes himself as \u201cthe only black Artist rapping and making music in china [sic throughout]\u201d and heavily publicizes his music through China\u2019s state-controlled social media. The Global Times described him as one of the most popular creators on Douyin, the Chinese version of Tik-tok \u2013 a feat impossible to execute without the Communist Party\u2019s approval.\n\nThe Global Times choosing to promote a Ghanaian transplant rapper directly contradicts the message of a now-deleted 2018 column in the same newspaper declaring that Chinese hip-hop cannot thrive because China is not racist, like the United States presumably is.\n\n\u201cNo one can transplant a cactus to Siberia or move polar bears to the equator,\u201d the column argued. \u201cIn this case, the living environment matters. Without a native culture for hip-hop, the cultural form can scarcely blossom in China.\u201d\n\n\u201cHip-hop was born in the African-American community of the U.S.,\u201d it continued. \u201cAlthough slavery ended with the nation\u2019s Civil War, people of color there have still struggled with poverty, racism and gang violence for quite some time.\u201d\n\nThe promotion of rappers without explicit political messaging \u2013 only the soft power of creating the illusion that China is welcoming to Africans following multiple Communist Party racism fiascos \u2013 appears to be a shift in strategy from Beijing. Initial attempts to enter the rap world began with animated propaganda videos about mundane Communist Party bureaucracy.\n\n\u201cStreamline the administration and delegate power to lower levels and unleash energy,\u201d a rapper demands in the 2015 regime-produced song \u201cThe Reform Group Is Two Years Old,\u201d featuring a sample of a Xi speech.\n\nThe failure of these government productions led the regime to find pro-communist rappers producing their own content. One of the most frequently featured groups in state media, CD Rev, published aggressive and vulgar songs against enemies of the state.\n\n\u201cTaiwan ain\u2019t a country, bitch\u2014at most a county \u2026 fuck that, the bitch Tsai Ing-wen,\u201d CD Rev rapped about the president of Taiwan in \u201cThe Force of Red,\u201d railing against journalist \u201cpunk ass white trash fuckers.\u201d\n\nCD Rev also found no mainstream popularity, though the censorship campaign against allegedly \u201cvulgar\u201d rap music did not target them.\n\nIn early 2018, the Communist Party declared it would \u201cpunish\u201d rappers who \u201ccross the line\u201d outside of communist orthodoxy, banning the genre from television.\n\n\u201cThe freedom of music should stand on morality and laws,\u201d a CD Rev member posted online approvingly.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1498, "llama_token_count": 1796}, {"source_name": "Camillestyles.com", "author": "Isabelle Eyman", "title": "Your Guide to Joshua Tree: Where to Stay and What to Eat, From a Local", "description": "Pack your bags.\r\n\n\nThe post Your Guide to Joshua Tree: Where to Stay and What to Eat, From a Local appeared first on Camille Styles.", "url": "https://camillestyles.com/wellness/things-to-do-in-joshua-tree/", "text": "All adventurers know: the best places to explore are those that feel hidden away from the world.

The cities, small towns, and countries that surprise us with their magic\u2014turning the experience of travel into something novel and unforeseen. It\u2019s this common pursuit that\u2019s elevated Joshua Tree to its recent destination-level status. If it\u2019s on your must-visit list, consider this your ultimate guide of things to do in Joshua Tree, from a local herself.\n\nThe high California desert boasts breathtaking views and of course, the endangered beauty of the Joshua tree. This eponymous hero of the desert offers food and habitat for countless living things, making the area home to a diverse array of wildlife and flora. It\u2019s the landscape\u2019s natural allure that\u2019s attracted so many creatives to the area. It\u2019s a haven for beautiful homes that blend with the environment and entrepreneurs who find inspiration in every corner of the desert.\n\n1 of 20\n\nHow to Spend a Long Weekend in Joshua Tree\n\nThe latter case describes our resident Joshua tree expert perfectly. Alison Carroll, co-founder alongside her husband Jay of the popular olive oil and skincare brand, Wonder Valley, intentionally sought out somewhere to build a life that allows for endless creative expansion. In Joshua Tree, Alison has found a community that supports her intuitive approach to life. She leads with a curiosity-first mindset, exploring and highlighting ingredients\u2019 full capacity in her recipes that feel all at once simple and fascinatingly complex. (A paradoxical feat only an artist-cum-chef can achieve.)\n\nBelow, Alison takes us through all the must-see, must-do highlights of this wonderfully, wholly unique area of the country. Trust: this is so much more than a bucket list. Instead, expect to find under-the-radar, locals-only recommendations that\u2019ll help you experience all the beauty Joshua Tree has to offer.\n\n2 of 20\n\nWhen to Visit Joshua Tree\n\nWhile some may seek out the breezy chill of autumn in New England or the Pacific Northwest, Alison loves October in the desert. If you want to experience all of Joshua Tree minus the heat, there isn\u2019t a better time than mid-fall. \u201cBy then, the intense summer heat has faded,\u201d Alison notes. \u201cThe days are warm and sunny, and the evenings cool.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t worry if you\u2019ve already used up all of your PTO days by fall. Depending on the year, spring can also be ideal. If the winter\u2019s been rainy, Alison calls spring \u201cthe season to visit.\u201d Cactus blooms in April and May, and if there\u2019s been enough rain, expect to see a superbloom. \u201cThe entire desert floor gets covered with tiny flowers and blanketed with color,\u201d Alison notes. \u201cEvery cactus is bursting with new growth and vibrant flowers, and the Joshua trees get trumpet-shaped big white blooms.\u201d\n\nHow to Get to Joshua Tree\n\nSkip the hectic chaos that is LAX\u2014Alison recommends flying into Palm Springs instead. \u201cYou get to wait outside under a palm tree until your flight boards, and there\u2019s so much to explore in the area,\u201d she says. If you have time to spare, extend your stay and explore the low desert as well.\n\nAlternatively, if you can\u2019t make Palm Springs happen (because it\u2019s a smaller airport, flights may be more expensive), LAX or even Vegas both work in a pinch. The upside of the latter option? \u201cThe drive is more expansive, open desert and there\u2019s less traffic,\u201d Alison adds.\n\nHer final note on transportation: if you\u2019re wanting to book a trip to Joshua Tree, you\u2019ll need a car to explore. Because of how remote the area is, you can\u2019t rely on publication transportation or ride shares like Uber to get around.\n\n3 of 20 4 of 20\n\n5 of 20\n\nWhat to Pack for a Long Weekend in Joshua Tree\n\nIt\u2019s the same as for any trip\u2014check the weather before you go. But given how much the temperatures fluctuate in the desert, you\u2019ll want to be all the more mindful of this tip when you\u2019re headed to Joshua Tree.\n\n\u201cLook at the low and high temperatures of the time of year you\u2019re coming,\u201d says Alison. \u201cWe can shift up to 40 degrees from day to night.\u201d For all the activity you\u2019ll be doing while you\u2019re in Joshua Tree, Alison suggests prioritizing comfort in your clothing and footwear choices, being sure to bring along a pair of sturdy hiking boots. In addition to that, you\u2019ll also want to be mindful to keep yourself protected from the desert sun. A hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen are all essentials.\n\nAlison\u2019s final note? \u201cGoing out in Joshua Tree couldn\u2019t be more casual\u2026 You\u2019d be fine saddling up to the bar in your rock climbing gear.

You can book Brandy\u2019s Joshua Tree cabins here for your next stay.\n\nCarroll Rock. Given Alison\u2019s expertise in design and hosting, it only makes sense that her rental home would be stunning. \u201cTaking an outdoor shower at night as the stars and moon come out is my single favorite thing about being in the high desert.\u201d It\u2019s a true desert oasis (with features in both Architectural Digest and Bon App\u00e9tit to confirm it). The Airbnb boasts a 360-view of boulders and mountains, giving the perfect perch for seeing all Joshua Tree has to offer.\n\n29 Palms Inn. Alison can\u2019t get enough of this elegant locale. (She\u2019s included it in her recommended spots to eat in Joshua Tree\u2014see below.) Close to Joshua Tree National Park and the Mojave Trails National Monument, this is also a great option if you\u2019d rather stay in a hotel. The property is comprised of Adobe bungalows and wood-framed cabins. Expect a unique stay full of character and unexpected design details sprinkled throughout.\n\n9 of 20\n\n10 of 20\n\nWhere to Eat in Joshua Tree\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of incredible food available in Joshua Tree\u2014and Alison is the best person to ask for recommendations. Her favorite way to kick off a weekend morning in Joshua Tree? The Saturday farmer\u2019s market. \u201cWe\u2019re spoiled with year-round incredible produce here in California, and the desert is no exception.\u201d If you\u2019re eating out, Alison\u2019s favorite spots for food include:\n\nMas o Menos. A new spot that\u2019s great for a daytime hang for coffee or cocktails.\n\nThe Dez and Roadrunner. Both have easy, ready-to-go options. Alison recommends grabbing something for the road at either spot and taking it to the park.\n\nRed Dog. A saloon that first opened in 1946, Alison calls Red Dog an \u201ceasy hang for tacos and strong drinks.\u201d\n\nTiny Pony. Want to dine like the locals in Joshua Tree? Be sure to stop by Tiny Pony, where the tavern vibes and natural wines couldn\u2019t be better. The pool table completes the look.\n\n29 Palms Inn. If you\u2019re craving an elegant poolside dinner, this is it. The 29 Palms Inn maintains the country-west vibes of the desert while also weaving in an elevated feel. (You can even pick up a picnic lunch if you\u2019d prefer to take your meal with you hiking.)\n\nLa Copine. Alison calls this \u201croadside bistro\u201d her favorite food in the desert. And while you don\u2019t have to make a reservation, she says it\u2019s best to secure your spot in advance.\n\n11 of 20\n\n12 of 20 13 of 20\n\nWhat to Do in Joshua Tree\n\nThe national park is, of course, your ultimate Joshua Tree destination. \u201cWe love exploring around the Wall Street Mill Trail in particular,\u201d says Alison.

For some summer fun, Rapha teamed up with British fashion brand Shrimps for a one-of-a-kind collaboration, expanding upon the brand\u2019s casual riding apparel. For a sport that can feel so steeped in rules, the two brands thought it was high time to blur some boundaries and redefine what it means to be a cyclist.\n\nCombining Shrimps\u2019 signature playful patterns and whimsical designs with Rapha\u2019s product innovation and off-bike stylings, the two companies have created a boundary-blurring aesthetic for those unafraid to stand out. Experimental but wearable, elevated but casual \u2013 this collection bridges the gap between fashion and cycling.\n\nWe wanted to commend the collection, for its quirkiness and fun aesthetics. Well done.\n\nRoll on over to Rapha for the 411.\n\nThe 600HXT is the first of its kind for bike brand Priority. The 600HXT employs the Gates Carbon Drive system and Pinion\u2019s revolutionary Smart Shift gearbox. Instead of relying on a vulnerable and unreliable chain, derailleur, and cassette weighing down the rear wheel, shifting occurs inside the centrally-mounted Pinion gearbox, and pedal power is delivered to the rear wheel by a mud-shedding carbon fiber-reinforced belt drive.\n\nSmart Shift electronic shifting on the 600HXT can snick between gears in 0.2 seconds and will bang through shift after shift reliably, regardless of riding conditions and pedal pressure. With fully-sealed internals, a 600% gear range, and the ability to shift nearly instantly the Smart Shift gearbox offers unrivaled performance and reliability.\n\nWhat\u2019s great about the 600HXT is the geometry is progressive without being over the top, meaning it\u2019ll hold its own in any terrain. With a 65\u00ba HTA and a 75.5\u00ba STA across all three sizes, it\u2019s ready for just about anything.\n\nSee more at Priority.\n\nGot a vintage MTB you want to convert to a proper dirt drop?

My true love in the area is Mount Lemmon, a world-class paved road climb that gains 6,000 feet (1,800 m) in 20 miles (32 km). On the way up you pass through seven biomes\u2014 starting with Saguaro Cactus and finishing in a pine forest that resembles those of Canada. There\u2019s a ski area up top and a small town with a couple of restaurants and a general store.\n\nThe komoot women\u2019s Arizona rally combines my favorite loop in the north and lovely remote riding near the border. The hardest stretch is the first 84 miles (135 km) \u2014 riding out Redington Road and climbing up the backside of Mount Lemmon. Once you get past that, you\u2019re golden.\n\nI\u2019m so excited to share this place. It\u2019s wild and remote. I made the route as accessible as possible, but it\u2019ll be a huge challenge. I\u2019m relying on my local friends to guide our international guests. It\u2019ll be our first komoot Women\u2019s Rally outside of Europe and will really be a dream come true.

Ortiz was born and raised in this border town of 35,000 in Val Verde County, a couple of hours southwest of San Antonio, where her father owned a sizable ranch on the north side of the road. When he passed away, the ranch was sold off in various parcels. She bought her 16 acres of land in the 1990s and raised her family here.\n\nNowadays, the retired teacher raises goats in a pen in her backyard. Her sister lives just down the road, as do her three children. It\u2019s nothing fancy, but it\u2019s home. It\u2019s quiet and peaceful. Or it was\u2014until all the construction trucks started whizzing by nonstop. And there have certainly been effects of increased migration from across the border. It\u2019s not uncommon to see small groups passing through, and some properties on the river side of the road have been vacated by owners after migrants started squatting in the houses, she said.\n\nThe increased rate of crossings from Mexico into this rural community was part of the reason she and the rest of her neighbors agreed to let the Texas Military Department build a 10-foot fence along their land next to the roadside, free of cost, in 2021. It\u2019s helped stop, or at least slow, migrants crossing through her property\u2014though the visibly patched chain-link barrier obviously isn\u2019t perfect. Plus, the tall cyclone fencing topped with razor wire makes her feel like she\u2019s living in a prison.\n\nOrtiz takes pride in the fact that you can identify where her property line starts and ends, along with the rest of her family\u2019s, because they were the only ones who opted not to have razor wire installed on top. But now she\u2019s dealing with the threat of another, bigger fence. Like many of her neighbors, land agents first contacted Ortiz early last year to see if she\u2019d be interested in allowing the State of Texas to build a border wall along the back of her land. As it turned out, her home was right in the middle of a nearly 7-mile stretch of 30-foot steel wall that the state was planning to build on orders from Republican Governor Greg Abbott.\n\nFrom the start, Ortiz was a firm \u201cno.\u201d But the land agent, who worked for a private company contracted by the state to acquire border properties, \u201ckept coming back and coming back,\u201d Ortiz recalls, giving an initial quote for payment, then coming back later with higher offers. \u201cSo he was kind of lowballing us at the very beginning,\u201d she said. \u201cI kept telling him, \u2018You\u2019re wasting your time. \u2026 I love my house. I love my ranch, no.\u2019\u201d\n\nOrtiz\u2019s predicament was the result of a highly politicized, multi-billion-dollar border security scheme rolled out by Abbott in 2021. Key to the governor\u2019s border gambit, dubbed \u201cOperation Lone Star,\u201d was a promise familiar to anyone with a pulse during the administration of former President Donald Trump: to build a great wall dividing Texas from Mexico. At first, this may have seemed like so much political bluster. Presidents from George W. Bush to Trump had struggled to build a wall along Texas\u2019 privately owned, nigh untamable, and riverine border\u2014and unlike them, Abbott didn\u2019t even have the power of eminent domain to wrench land from residents.\n\nNevertheless, Abbott\u2019s scheme is slowly and inefficiently becoming what could be one of the largest and most expensive public infrastructure projects in state history. At his direction, the state government has identified about 800 miles of border supposedly in need of a barrier; at the state\u2019s current pace, that would put taxpayers on the hook for nearly $20 billion over 30 years. The Legislature has already shoveled nearly $1 billion to the governor for a first installment of roughly 40 miles, with close to another billion dollars on the way for the next phase. Abbott\u2019s wall is primed to become a permanent strain on taxpayers\u2019 wallets, a direct threat to border communities, wildlife, and landowners who fear they will be railroaded by the state, and a new source of cronyism as the state wheels and deals with political patrons to advance the governor\u2019s pet project.\n\nAfter ramping up slowly and quietly in the background of the governor\u2019s broader border offensive, Abbott\u2019s wall is now quickly becoming reality. For Ortiz and others who live along Vega Verde Road, that reality has become an unwelcome incursion.\n\nWhatever the state was offering, Ortiz knew it wouldn\u2019t account for the impact of a hulking wall on the value of her land and house. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, pointing to her home, \u201cis not going to be worth what it\u2019s supposed to be worth. \u2026 Who\u2019s going to want to buy a house with a big border wall saying, \u2018Okay, you belong to Mexico; you belong to [Ciudad] Acu\u00f1a\u2019?\u201d\n\nBut the state acquired the rights to build its wall on land owned by many of her neighbors. Since construction began this spring, the wall has grown closer to both sides of her property, and Ortiz fears it will just funnel traffic from across the border through her home. She and others on Vega Verde worry that, eventually, they may be forced to take whatever the state offers.\n\nOrtiz\u2019s son Raul Gaona, who moved with his family four years ago into a house just down the road, is in an even worse position. The state wants to build right through his property, too, but the wall would end up coming within a stone\u2019s throw from the front door of his home. He rejected their first offer, and when they came back offering twice as much, he declined again: \u201c$18,000 won\u2019t last me too long, and I\u2019ll have that fence here the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nGaona cherishes the solitude of sitting on his front porch with no one around. If he had an ugly wall looming over him, he said he would probably move away. \u201cI\u2019m going to wait it out, see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just got here. \u2026 I really don\u2019t want to just up and leave already.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Abbott came to Del Rio for a border security town hall at the local civic center, where he trumpeted the rollout of his nascent Operation Lone Star. Gearing up for a third-term reelection bid, Abbott was facing increasingly heated threats of primary challenges from his right flank, and he was using this newfangled operation, the latest in a long line of theatrical border security surges in Texas, as a way to burnish his immigration hawk credentials.\n\nHis town hall speech climaxed with an announcement that he would soon begin construction of a border wall in Texas, picking up Trump\u2019s wall-building mantle, which had been shirked by President Joe Biden. The pronouncement drew rapturous applause and cheers from the crowd, which Abbott paused to soak in for nearly 20 seconds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Third World country where these farmers and ranchers are living with their lives on the line every single day,\u201d Abbott said, in an interview days later, of the need for a wall in places like Del Rio. \u201cSomebody has to step up for these people. And that\u2019s the governor of Texas.\u201d\n\nSome Texas GOP leaders like ex-Governor Rick Perry and Senator John Cornyn, possessed of at least a passing familiarity with the state\u2019s border, have been skeptical of physical border walls. But Trump completely shifted the Overton window such that building the wall eclipsed everything else, including concerns about the feds infringing on private property rights and the exorbitant cost to taxpayers.\n\n\u201cGovernor Abbott had to build this wall. There was no choice politically. This was the direction the party was going,\u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus, a University of Houston political science professor. \u201cHe had to follow along or be left behind.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration targeted nearly 750 miles of U.S.-Mexico border for wall construction at an average cost of about $20 million per mile\u2014a rate five times higher than the cost of fencing built by prior administrations. Ultimately, Trump completed only about 400 miles of wall, much of that in the form of replacing existing smaller barriers in Southwestern states where the borderlands were already federally owned. Even with federal eminent domain powers, Trump struggled to wrench land away from Texas fronterizos\u2014whose land is often passed down by family through several generations with tangled webs of ownership records\u2014building only 50 miles in Texas, about 20 of those miles in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nWhen Biden took office in early 2021, he ground almost all wall construction to a halt, suspending billions in awarded contracts and throwing condemnation lawsuits into limbo. The State of Texas promptly sued the feds, claiming that Biden was legally mandated to continue construction, in a pending case. Since Biden\u2019s ascension to the White House, \u201cThe border wall has become a living symbol of the Republican Party\u2019s desire to put a fork in the eye of the federal government and to use that as political leverage in Texas,\u201d Rottinghaus said.\n\nA week after his Del Rio summit, Abbott, flanked by a coterie of top Republican lawmakers in Austin, issued a directive ordering the Texas Facilities Commission (TFC)\u2014a small agency in charge of constructing and maintaining state government offices\u2014to direct his massive, politically driven wall-building project. And Abbott signed a letter to Biden demanding that the president return any private property seized by the feds to landowners so the state could negotiate with those landowners for its own wall.\n\nAt Abbott\u2019s side, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick humbly declared that the governor\u2019s directive was more consequential than any other action taken by a governor in modern history. \u201cThis document will go down as one of the most important documents in the history of Texas. Because it\u2019s reclaiming our land, our border, our country, our state, for the people of Texas and America,\u201d he crowed. \u201cWe are being invaded.\u201d\n\nAbbott\u2019s critics met the rollout of his border wall project with outrage over the use of state money to continue a federal project, along with skepticism about whether this was all just a big campaign stunt. But, regardless of the original motivation, Abbott seems to have committed to the bit\u2014and he\u2019s validating virtually all his detractors\u2019 concerns along the way.\n\nSince its launch, the state has provided little in the way of public information or transparency about the details of its border wall plans. TFC has refused to provide or confirm basic details about the project, citing concerns about homeland security and terrorism. The agency has also declined the Texas Observer\u2019s requests to interview the TFC executive director or commissioners.\n\nOver the past several months, the Observer has filed numerous public information requests and scoured public contract documents, state expenditure data, and county land records to track where the wall is headed, how taxpayer money is being spent, and to get an inside look at how the state government has navigated its entry into the perilous business of wall-building.\n\n\u201cGovernor Abbott had to build this wall. There was no choice politically.\u201d\n\nAbbott\u2019s wall-building scheme, like its federal predecessor, has so far proven itself to be a slow-moving, billion-plus-dollar boondoggle that has produced very little completed wall and plenty of logistical quagmires, delays, and soaring costs, while sparking resistance and resentment among many landowners and local leaders who find themselves in the project\u2019s path.\n\nLocal officials have often been kept in the dark about plans developed and approved hundreds of miles away in Austin to build wall in their communities. Meanwhile, the GOP-controlled Legislature eagerly rubber-stamped $1 billion for the governor\u2019s wall in 2021. This session, a bill by GOP state Senator Brandon Creighton that would have given TFC eminent domain powers to construct its wall\u2014citing the need to build more quickly\u2014died without a floor vote. But, with hardly any public oversight and debate, lawmakers approved a budget that gives the governor roughly another billion dollars for the wall.\n\nDriving along the peaks of a rolling caliche road in western Starr County in mid-May, stretches of border fencing peek out through the rolling green chaparral and scrubland, cutting through the landscape for thousands of feet like a rust-colored wound. An orchestra of rare birds chirping competes with the faint din of heavy machinery down in a valley\u2014the beeping and grinding and whirring of bulldozers and concrete trucks.\n\nA few weeks earlier, botanists and plant enthusiasts from around the Rio Grande Valley received an emergency bat signal and flocked to a private ranch that runs along the river in remote western Starr County. The pristine land features a largely undisturbed habitat home to a diverse array of rare plant and animal species. For years, it\u2019s been a destination for birders and naturalists to visit with permission from the owner.\n\nIn January, though, the landowner\u2014a family who asked that their name not be used in this story\u2014had signed an easement granting the State of Texas permission to build a border wall through the property, county land records show. Now, construction crews were beginning to raze a path over 2 miles long through the ranch, destroying any habitat in the way. The plant-lovers\u2019 plan was to rescue as many specimens as possible and transplant them to a new home on a private property a few miles away.\n\nOne of those who came to help was an amateur botanist who goes by Joey Santore. He produces a popular YouTube channel called \u201cCrime Pays But Botany Doesn\u2019t,\u201d featuring his self-described \u201clow-brow, crass approach to plant ecology as muttered by a misanthropic Chicago Italian.\u201d In early April, he ran an episode that documented the devastating impact of Abbott\u2019s wall on this land as volunteers scrambled in 100-degree fahrenheit heat to save as much as they could.\n\nHis camera panned across a portion of land that had just been bulldozed as he asked, \u201cHow much cool stuff was just destroyed this morning?\u201d He showed a bulldozer in action, stirring up a massive plume of dust on what had become a barren swath of land. Aerial drone footage showed the immense footprint of the coming wall. All this, he mused, for a stupid political stunt: \u201cThis is just Abbott basically just trying to flex his muscle and put on some showmanship.\u201d\n\nStakes in the ground marked what would soon be cleared. \u201cEverything that way is getting smushed,\u201d he said. He pointed to a giant clump of coryphantha macromeris\u2014nipple beehive cactus\u2014to yucca constricta and hechtia, to dahlia hedgehog, fish-hook cacti, and peyote: rare and native plants, highly resilient species that thrive in this arid, rocky habitat with strong, nutrient-dense tuberous roots. Santore noticed a bed of large fossils that he said was from the Eocene Epoch when, over 30 million years ago, this land was at the bottom of a shallow ocean. \u201cThis is fuckin\u2019 morbid man. Texas just does not give a fuck.\u201d\n\nA biologist in the video told Santore that volunteers had recently found a handful of prostrate milkweed plants around the property, including one in the impact zone of construction, which they were able to save. Just weeks earlier, in late February, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had officially listed the rare plant\u2014which exists in just a few populations in South Texas and northern Mexico\u2014as an endangered species. When the agency had initially announced its proposal a year earlier, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton promptly filed a 12-page letter complaining that the Biden administration was restricting the state\u2019s ability to implement border security measures\u2014\u201cincluding but not limited to construction of a border barrier.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s office also chided Biden for kowtowing to woke wildlife. \u201cInstead of stepping up to protect innocent lives from human traffickers and stopping the influx of deadly drugs like fentanyl from coming across our border, President Biden has instead chosen to focus on protecting plants,\u201d an Abbott spokesperson told the Texas Tribune last February.\n\nEven with the federal designation, it\u2019s not clear that the presence of endangered prostate milkweed would halt construction of the state wall in this part of Starr County, since the Endangered Species Act provides fewer protections for vulnerable plants on state and private land than on federal property. Records show that TFC and its project contractors knew there was a possible presence of prostrate milkweed and Zapata bladderpod, another endangered plant, on the ranch that could be impacted by the wall construction; it\u2019s not clear what, if any, measures were taken. TFC said in a statement that its program manager, the Michael Baker & Huitt-Zollars Joint Venture, \u201cis responsible for ensuring compliance with environmental and regulatory requirements from a program perspective.\u201d\n\nStarr County had been among Trump\u2019s primary targets for his wall, with the administration essentially planning to wall off the entire county. The feds seized many riverside properties but managed to build almost nothing before Trump left office. The ranch featured in Santore\u2019s YouTube video was spared condemnation during Trump\u2019s term. Then the state came knocking with its plans to build 7 miles along a stretch of land west of the border town of Roma.\n\nThe state awarded the contract for the ranch in Santore\u2019s video to a company called BFBC, which was among the top wall builders for Trump. The firm is getting $47 million to build the 1.75 mile segment, a rate of nearly $27 million per mile. Timothy Barnard, the founder and chairman of BFBC\u2019s parent company, is an active GOP donor. After BFBC got its state contract last September, he cut a $5,000 check to Abbott\u2019s campaign\u2014his first donation to a state politician in Texas. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cThis is fuckin\u2019 morbid man. Texas just does not give a fuck.\u201d\n\nOther landowners in the area, such as the Valley Land Fund, a conservation group that owns a small bird preserve on the banks of the river in Sali\u00f1eno\u2014a popular spot for birders visiting from around the country\u2014are standing firm against the state. \u201cWe have just chosen to take a stand to not allow the state to access our land,\u201d said Debralee Rodriguez, executive director of the group. Building a wall through their property, which is just 2.6 acres and under 300 feet wide, would almost certainly force the reserve to close: \u201cIf you did that to our small land, you\u2019d wipe out all our vegetation.\u201d\n\nDespite the Fund\u2019s resistance, the state appears to be going ahead with plans to build right next to its northern property line, on a piece of land owned by a local water supply company, according to county property records. If that happens, the bird sanctuary would be surrounded on either side.\n\nThe state\u2019s proposed wall route in Starr includes dozens of land parcels, many of which were seized or targeted by the feds under Trump. Courts have since returned much of that property, but Texas is having a hard time persuading these landowners to voluntarily sign over land rights.\n\nAbbott and TFC have publicly said that most people are willing to accept the wall on their land and that \u201chard no\u2019s\u201d are few and far between. But in contract documents from February, the state\u2019s program manager painted a less rosy picture: Along the first 45 miles targeted by the state, only 25 percent of landowners were participating.\n\nIn the nearly two years after the wall project was launched, very little new fencing was completed. By the end of 2022, the first segment of wall along 1.7 miles of farmland, owned by the state\u2019s General Land Office in rural Starr County, was only just getting completed\u2014roughly five months behind schedule and at a cost of about $35 million, contract records show. And that was supposed to be the easy part.\n\nTexas has awarded contracts worth nearly $850 million to build 40 miles in various segments from Brownsville and Los Indios, near the Gulf, upriver to Starr County, through big ranches and tiny towns in Webb County, to Del Rio.\n\nMillions of dollars have been spent on a small army of land agents, appraisers, and title agents who\u2019ve swarmed across South Texas working to convince landowners to sign over their land for Abbott\u2019s wall. Yet TFC has obtained just a fraction of the land needed to complete its first phase of construction. As of May, the agency had closed deals for about 15 miles of property, with 25 miles still in the negotiation process, records show. Only 3.48 miles of wall had actually been completed\u2014out of the over 700 miles that Abbott wants in total.\n\n\u201cThe planning here is very piecemeal and doesn\u2019t appear to have a systematic goal, except to just show the flag and pretend that something approximating the Trump effort is still continuing,\u201d said Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law who specializes in government contracting. \u201cThe Trump effort had the resources of the federal government behind it. Even that wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\nThe agency that Abbott has put in charge of all this, the Texas Facilities Commission, is run by Michael Novak, a tall, silver-haired former construction executive from San Antonio who once ran a failed bid as a Chamber of Commerce conservative against incumbent state Senator Donna Campbell. He served for several years as a commissioner at TFC until he was tapped to become executive director in 2018.\n\nNovak described his agency\u2019s assignment as needing to essentially replicate the Army Corps of Engineers, the federal government\u2019s civil engineering outfit that designed and directed the Trump wall effort. TFC has done this by effectively outsourcing the entire operation to a pair of private contractors: Broaddus & Associates, which advises the state agency, and the Michael Baker & Huitt-Zollars Joint Venture, the project manager in charge of construction.\n\n\u201cSending the TFC out to build a wall along the length of the U.S.-Mexico border is like calling up Angie\u2019s List to get someone to build a fortress,\u201d Tiefer said.\n\nAbbott specifically ordered the wall to be built to the exact same specifications as Trump\u2019s, so the design phase may have been a light lift. But his early promises that landowners would volunteer property and that money would flow in from red-blooded Americans nationwide have fallen flat. A crowdfunding effort Abbott launched in 2021 pulled in a little over $50 million, with 98 percent coming from a hermetic billionaire heir in Wyoming.\n\nBaker & Huitt\u2019s initial contract, for $10.3 million, has since tripled in cost through a series of amendments as the project expanded and more resources were pumped into the state\u2019s land acquisition campaign. By mid-November of 2022, the firm had exhausted its budget, meant to last through March, due to protracted land acquisition challenges, requiring a contract amendment for another $2.5 million just to keep going. \u201cIt is obvious that a different model for negotiations will need to be employed to curtail endless negotiations with landowners on these projects,\u201d the company wrote in its amended contract proposal. A few months later, TFC extended Baker & Huitt\u2019s contract through the end of 2024.\n\nAbbott has acknowledged his wall\u2019s molassal pace, while claiming things are improving. \u201cOne thing that has slowed our process a little bit is getting those rights to build the wall,\u201d he said in January at a press conference in the tiny border community of Los Indios, where he celebrated the start of a less-than-mile stretch of wall and announced a new \u201cborder czar.\u201d But the governor\u2019s bullish on his project\u2019s future: \u201cWith the work of the Facilities Commission, we have accelerated that process of acquiring the land rights.\u201d In a TV interview later that month, Abbott predicted that in 2023, \u201cWe may wind up adding more border wall than President Trump was able to add in his entire presidency.\u201d\n\nMore wall means more money for the lucky few contractors that were selected, through an open bid process, to build the first 40 miles of wall: Posillico Civil, Southwest Valley Constructors, BFBC, Fisher Sand & Gravel, and SLSCO. All of these firms had collectively received billions in federal contract awards to build the Trump wall, and one of them\u2014Fisher\u2014built a private wall in Hidalgo County that was originally connected to a fraudulent crowdfunding scheme run by now-convicted Trump allies. That wall is now in danger of collapsing into the Rio Grande.\n\nBy spring, four of these contractors had finally begun construction on six different sites totalling close to 15 miles. \u201cWe feel the program has reached a tipping point and we are gaining significant momentum,\u201d Richard Cellon, one of TFC\u2019s project consultants, said at a March meeting. But the effort was still well behind schedule. TFC had initially estimated that the five construction projects would be completed by mid-2024, records show, but ahead of this year\u2019s legislative session,TFC had pushed its estimate back to the fall of 2025\u2014four years after the border wall funds were approved.\n\nAs sine die approached in late May, Texas had completed less than four miles of border wall. The Facilities Commission had paid out about $150 million in total for the wall, including $90 million to its builders and over $40 million to Gibraltar Fabrication for 13 miles worth of steel bollard panels\u2014which the state claims to have bought at a steep discount because of the feds halting wall construction. TFC had also paid about $3.75 million to acquire land rights from dozens of property owners.\n\nAt least one of these land deals has also raised the specter of possible cronyism. In February, the state struck a deal to acquire the rights to build five miles of wall through Faith Ranch in the vast, unpopulated terrain of far western Webb County. The ranch is owned by Houston oil and ranching heir Stuart Stedman, a longtime ally of the governor who has given his campaign over $1 million since 2015. The state paid him $1.5 million in the deal\u2014effectively funneling public dollars to a major Abbott donor to boost the governor\u2019s pet project. TFC then awarded the construction contract to build the wall through the ranch to none other than Fisher Sand & Gravel.\n\nIt will cost Texas taxpayers $120 million for Fisher to build the 5-mile-long wall through the ranch of the governor\u2019s buddy, about $24 million per mile, which will require building an access road through the ranch to the nearest county road. Stedman\u2019s agreement also stipulates that the wall will include several gates, openings for irrigation and drainage pipes, and construction of a new cattle fence\u2014accommodations that not all landowners are receiving.\n\nTFC told the Observer that it couldn\u2019t comment on negotiations or other specifics about the Faith Ranch project due to \u201csecurity concerns and protecting procurement integrity,\u201d though the agency did say the governor was not involved. Stedman did not respond to requests for comment. The governor\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment about this and other matters for this story.\n\nBack along Vega Verde Road, on a late Tuesday morning in early May, one landowner looked regretfully across a swath of razed land along the back end of his small ranch as construction crews crossed into the western edge of his property and began installing rusty reddish steel bollard panels. If he\u2019d known what he did now, he would have never signed up for this.\n\nLand agents from a company called Universal Field Services, which is contracted to acquire land for the state, first contacted the retired rancher\u2014who did not want his name used due to privacy and safety concerns\u2014about a year ago with an offer to acquire the rights to build a border wall through his property.\n\nWhile the state was prohibited from using eminent domain to seize land for its wall, the landowner said the landmen implied he would be wise to sell now lest that change. \u201cWhether you like it or not, it was going to be built,\u201d he said, summarizing their pitch. So he bargained their initial offer up to $25,000 and signed a contract granting the state a permanent 50-foot-wide easement to build its wall and a patrol road along his back property line, a decision he now wishes he could take back.\n\nA former mechanic at Laughlin Air Force Base near Del Rio, he bought his 40-acre piece of land nearly 20 years ago for his retirement. The ranchette wasn\u2019t a moneymaker, but over the years he\u2019s been able to raise some cattle, goats, pigs, and horses. The payment from the state last year covered a substantial amount of what he originally paid for the property. He figured a big wall along the edge of his ranch, which abuts a railroad track, wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.\n\nBut once construction crews began clearing the back portion of his land in April, the landowner realized the wall wasn\u2019t going to be built along his property line as agreed. Instead, it would run 30 feet inside that line\u2014lopping off the back of his ranch. Apparently, the electric company that runs its power lines along the railway had recently told the state it had to realign its wall route.\n\nThe state\u2019s land agents, he said, didn\u2019t inform him of the change until he confronted them, and he spent weeks trying to get the state to compensate him for the additional land and comply with other terms of his original agreement\u2014all while construction continued through his property.\n\nThe state ultimately offered to pay him $15,000 more, he said, but no final deal had been reached as of mid-June\u2014in part because he said the state reneged on a promise to install an access gate.\n\n\u201cDue to security and privacy concerns, specific project details are not being released at this time,\u201d a TFC spokesperson said in a statement. The agency, and its team of contractors, \u201cworks diligently to address all construction concerns with stakeholders.\u201d\n\nAs he watched the wall cut through his ranch, one steel panel after another, the Del Rio landowner felt that even if he got the extra money, it wouldn\u2019t be worth it. The impact of wall construction was far beyond what he\u2019d imagined: The crews are using his own soil to level the path for the wall and have reshaped the land in a way that will funnel all the rainwater and runoff from neighboring properties into his property. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty much using the rest of my property for their project,\u201d he said. After a recent heavy rain, he said he found a strange white fluid in a pond on his land that he believes is runoff from the construction.\n\nLooking back, this landowner feels like he got burned by the agents who were sent to acquire his land on behalf of the state. \u201cDon\u2019t trust them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey already did me wrong.\u201d", "tiktoken_token_count": 6338, "llama_token_count": 7426}, {"source_name": "MetalSucks", "author": "Hesher Keenan", "title": "Saliva and Drowning Pool to Take Concertgoers Back to the Early 2000s with Their U.S. Tour This Fall", "description": "Like a trip back in time.\nThe post Saliva and Drowning Pool to Take Concertgoers Back to the Early 2000s with Their U.S. Tour This Fall appeared first on MetalSucks.", "url": "https://www.metalsucks.net/2023/06/29/saliva-and-drowning-pool-to-take-concertgoers-back-to-the-early-2000s-with-their-u-s-tour-this-fall/", "text": "There was a time, way back when the U.S. was just invading Iraq and we were always remembering our national trauma, when bands like Saliva and Drowning Pool struck it big.

Roohi Ghosh is the Ambassador for Researcher Outreach, Engagement, and Success at CACTUS. Lindsay Morton is a Senior Communications Manager of Open Science Community Engagement at PLOS.\n\nPeer Review Week (September 25-29, 2023) is an annual global event exploring and celebrating the essential role of peer review in evaluating the rigor, credibility, and potential interest of research submitted for publication consideration. This year\u2019s Peer Review Week theme is \u201cPeer Review and the Future of Publishing.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe evolving landscape of the scholarly review process\n\nScholarly publishing is in the midst of seismic, transformational change, and faces pressure from many different directions. It\u2019s no wonder that \u201cThe Future of Publishing\u201d resonated so profoundly with the voters and stakeholders in our poll to select this year\u2019s theme (details below).\n\nIt\u2019s an unsettling time in what has been, for more than 350 years, a remarkably stable undertaking, with changes taking place in how research is conducted, the rise of Open Access (OA) and open science, the evolution of big data, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), and more. Even the transition from analog to digital publishing represented more of a change of venue than a fundamental shift in the business models, norms, or values that have always sustained and guided scholarly publishing.\n\nAs we consider how to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities of this moment in our industry, it makes sense also to reconsider how we manage peer review selection, how we gather expert feedback, and how we honor and reward reviewers. How can we make peer review easier and more fulfilling for reviewers, more efficient and effective for editors and publishers, and more trustworthy for everyone? How can we distribute the rewards and responsibilities of peer review more equitably?\n\nIt is imperative for stakeholders across the whole scholarly ecosystem to work together proactively to ensure that peer review keeps up with the evolving publishing landscape and remains our most powerful tool for evaluating the rigor, credibility, and interest of scholarly research.\n\nThe many, interconnected factors influencing the future of scholarly publishing, include:\n\nChanges in how research is conducted\n\nCollaboration is becoming increasingly common practice, both as a result of team science, and increased globalization. As research becomes more complex and cross-disciplinary, it is harder for a single Principal Investigator (PI) to oversee and execute all aspects of the work they are leading. To meet the challenges of big, multifaceted investigations, researchers must work together as a team, with two or more equal partners taking on the responsibilities of a senior researcher within their specific areas of expertise. Assessing broader, more diverse research outputs requires broader, more diverse expertise.\n\nIncreasingly, these collaborations are global. According to the National Science Board, the percentage of science and engineering articles published with international research collaborations (including authors from at least two countries) increased from 17% to 23% between 2008 and 2018. As of 2018, science and engineering articles had high rates of international collaborations, including: the UK (62%), Australia (60%), France (59%), Canada (56%), Germany (53%), Spain (53%), and Italy (50%).\n\nOur publishing infrastructure lags behind modern research practices in many ways. Can two reviewers with similar research backgrounds fully assess multidisciplinary work? Are current publisher networks representative of the expanded author pool? How do we allocate academic credit for authors and reviewers alike in a way that reflects collaborative rather than hierarchical professional relationships?\n\nThe rise of Open Access and Open Science\n\nOA has been a part of the scholarly publishing ecosystem for more than two decades, with a significant but minority market share. Recently, however, the growth of OA publishing \u2014 and the adoption of adjunct Open Science practices such as data sharing, code sharing, preprint posting, and open peer review \u2014 appears to have accelerated. This increase in open scholarship is driven by researchers\u2019 goals and priorities, as well as by public policy changes, funder mandates, and the influence of the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. In the face of these pressures, both subscription model journals and fee-per-publication OA journals must find financially viable ways to provide equitable access to both published research and publishing services.\n\nAt the same time, non-article research outputs like data, methods, and code are gaining prominence. New journals and services are emerging to house and preserve these assets, making them into citable publications in their own right\u2014and opening new questions about review and assessment standards and best practices.\n\nBig data, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence\n\nBig data analytics, NLP, and AI have the potential to reshape the scholarly review process. These transformative technologies can revolutionize how we manage and evaluate the publishing pipeline and improve the efficiency of peer review. But there are ethical considerations as well.\n\nBig data analytics has made it possible to process and analyze vast amounts of scholarly content, including articles, citations, and reviewer data. It can help to streamline the review process and create new opportunities for automation, allowing for faster manuscript assessments and reducing publication bottlenecks. For instance, automated tools can assist with the preliminary identification of relevant literature, plagiarism, image manipulation, and fraud, and perform grammar and language checks. Machine learning algorithms can analyze patterns and structures in scholarly content to highlight potential weaknesses in arguments, methodology, or data analysis. Improved data processing can assist journals and publishers in the identification of emerging trends, submission patterns, and connections that may not be immediately apparent otherwise. These operational efficiencies free reviewers to focus their expertise on the research, where it is needed most. In what other ways might AI technologies assist in providing valuable feedback and identifying key areas for improvement, and how might that change the reviewer role?\n\nAt the same time, there are important ethics considerations when utilizing AI, including in the review process. For example, potential bias in the underlying algorithms or training data might introduce discrimination into the editorial screening or review process. What ethical considerations should be taken into account when utilizing AI and NLP technologies in the review process, and how do we ensure that it continues to become more equitable and inclusive, rather than less?\n\nPeer Review and the Future of Publishing\n\nUnderlying and parallel with these changes is another long-term pain point: the increasing demands on peer reviewers, and challenges inherent in the peer review process and experience.\n\nMore scholarly articles and more different types of scholarly research outputs are entering the literature all the time. Publishers report sending more reviewer invitations to secure the same number of reviews. Some reviewers report receiving overwhelming numbers of requests to review, including being invited to review the same article for different journals \u2014 all while balancing this with the need to prioritize their own research. Clearly, continuing with the status quo is unsustainable in the long run.\n\nLooking ahead to Peer Review Week\n\nIn order to ensure that Peer Review Week 2023 addresses the most pressing issues and reflects the needs and interests of the scholarly community, the Peer Review Week Committee sought input from stakeholders in selecting the theme for this year\u2019s event. More than 870 members of our community voted on the theme, with 32.1% of respondents selecting \u201cPeer Review and the Future of Publishing.\u201d\n\nThe theme this year is broad but timely. It invites us to look around, reflect on the changes taking place, and consider the implications. It\u2019s also a chance to envision the future we want. We hope that this Peer Review Week will provide an opportunity for our community and the researchers we serve to come together and engage in thoughtful discussion around what we hope the future of publishing might look like, and the role of peer review in that future. After all, the changes we now face impact all journals \u2014 whether our publications originated as letters between nineteenth-century scientists, or were born digital earlier in this century; whether we use a subscription model, or an APC; whether we conduct peer review in complete anonymity, complete transparency, or somewhere in between.\n\nWe look forward to seeing the many different trends you observe, the \u201cFutures\u201d you envision, and the new directions in which you take this years\u2019 theme!\n\nGet involved in Peer Review Week 2023\n\nWe invite everyone to participate in Peer Review Week 2023, in the capacity that makes the most sense for them\u2014join the Steering Committee, host a live event or webinar, delve into the themes in a blog or editorial\u2014or something else!\n\nTo volunteer for the Steering Committee, email contactprweek@gmail.com.

In most areas outside the warmest regions of the United States, dahlia tubers must be dug up and stored or covered before the cold season.

It was a refreshing move for the Narrows to get a band where the people are in their 50s rather than their 70s\u2026.Anyway, it was my second Cracker show and my opinion remains the same as it always has been. It\u2019s that Cracker is a fun band and a worthy band and that Camper Van Beethoven is unquestionably the better and more interesting band. And they do a couple CVB songs, including \u201cTake the Skinheads Bowling.\u201d I\u2019ve long felt that David Lowery and Johnny Hickman were an odd pairing. Lowery is, well, Lowery, with his unique sensibilities. Hickman is a flashy and excellent guitarist whose work really fits more in the blues and country/rock worlds than with Lowery. But they\u2019ve had a whole career now of solid to really good albums, so it worked and still works. They haven\u2019t released anything in a good long time now so this is more a greatest hits shows, plus a couple cool covers (Lowery played The Grateful Dead\u2019s \u201cLoser,\u201d but they put that on an early album and have played it forever so it\u2019s almost their song too at this point), including Hickman doing a killer version of Dwight Yoakam\u2019s \u201cBuenas Noches from a Lonely Room,\u201d which he doesn\u2019t play very often. Good show, if not breaking any new ground in 2023. Actually, there\u2019s one exception to that. Lowery started the show with his relatively new solo pandemic song \u201cDisneyland Jail,\u201d which is a great song for parents\u2013about being a fuckup who gets into trouble going to Disneyland and then you have kids and OMG please do not do what I did! So check that one out if you can. Here\u2019s the setlist for the show.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t have much to say about Tony Bennett. His kind of music was never my thing, but as the last of a generation, an icon, and an overall good guy, he certainly deserves to be mentioned here.\n\nOutstanding New Yorker deep dive into the divisive politics of the contemporary Nashville music scene, where you have a deeply racist and misogynist Nashville record industry doubling down on that as Ben Shapiro and others try to make Nashville a right-wing paradise versus the huge alternative country scene there that is rooted by people such as Jason Isbell and Maren Morris and Brandi Carlisle and a lot of others. That scene is increasingly Black and it is increasingly queer. It is openly challenging the politics of a Nashville establishment that hates them. And they aren\u2019t going to win that battle. They know that. One of the points of the story is the refusal of country radio to ever play two songs by a woman in row and that they have told those complaining that they don\u2019t care and shut up feminist bitches. Another key point here is that the single only Nashville star to have stepped up at all in the face of the Tennessee anti-trans ban is Morris, who really truly doesn\u2019t give a fuck what anyone thinks. This group is very upset that two people who have always claimed to be allies have done things\u2013Miranda Lambert and Dolly Parton. This is worth noting about Dolly. Everyone loves her but she does nothing to move any politics forward. And she never has. That\u2019s part of her success. She really challenges no one when it matters. And she never has. She is a capitalist, not an activist. So for all as she\u2019s an icon of the gay community and one of the few country artists liberals like, she has proven utterly worthless on the trans ban.\n\nSpeaking of the disaster of mainstream country music politics, here\u2019s the story on douchebro Luke Combs making Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cFast Car\u201d a #1 hit. In doing so, he is taking a song about the struggles of a Black woman and making it the struggles of a white man, evidently without the slightest inhibitions of ripping off the message. The irony of this is that this makes Chapman the first Black woman to be the sole writer of a #1 country hit. At least she\u2019s making deserved cash.\n\nAnd then there is Jason Aldean, one of the worst living Americans, who just embraces the fascism. By now you\u2019ve heard about this. He is embarrassing even to the Nashville establishment, who don\u2019t reward him with awards despite his popularity with the aging white suburban women who make up mainstream Nashville\u2019s shrinking market. His latest hit is the worst of all\u2013another list song, but instead of all the things about the country you like, it\u2019s a list of all the things about the cities that are horrible. Of course the list is just complete nonsense, stuff recycled from 1980s crime dramas. But the tone is even worse\u2013threatening. It\u2019s basically a defense of vigilante violence. Now there\u2019s a video and\u2026.the choice of a location was the Maury County Courthouse in Tennessee, which so happens to also be the site of a lynching in 1927. For a mainstream publication like Variety, this is an absolute evisceration of Aldean and everything is he is about. In fact, the video is so offensive that CMT has pulled it, though most people will just watch it on YouTube anyway, which is a good site for hate so perfect for this.\n\nSo if I am waiting in an airport, I have no idea why I would want a playlist based on flying or being in an airport, but here\u2019s one for you.

Here\u2019s a playlist to get you started. Incidentally, if you\u2019ve never heard their daughter Charlotte Gainsbourg\u2019s IRM album, it\u2019s a long time favorite of mine.\n\nI know basically nothing about the world of modern performers of classical music, but given that Andr\u00e9 Watts was one of the first Black Americans to get to the peak of his profession, his death should be noted.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Rick Froberg, frontman for Driving Like Jehu, who died at the age of 55. Can\u2019t say I had thought about that band in a long, long, long time. Bad ticker, undiagnosed, you know how that goes.\n\nThe great Brazilian pianist Jo\u00e3o Donato also died, at the age of 88.

Singing in both English and French, this is some great dreamy indie pop about taking grief and turning it into something positive in your life. There\u2019s no simple answer. And this is something that is not exactly original, but it\u2019s also something that never gets old as it is so central to the human condition. So as I watch the world burn and the destruction of this beautiful planet, maybe this will help me.\n\nA-\n\nTenniscoats, Tan-Tan Therapy\n\nThis is a 2022 remaster of this Japanese pop group\u2019s 2007 release. It\u2019s the first I heard of it. Some people were really into this release, but I find it really quite boring. It\u2019s slow ambient music with some indie pop sounds. But there really is so little going on here that couldn\u2019t be done better by others.\n\nC\n\nIkue Mori/Satoko Fujii/Natsuki Tamura, Prickly Pear Cactus\n\nLet\u2019s stay in Japan with three of the greatest Japanese jazz players of our time. Fujii, the pianist, and Tamura, the trumpeter, are a long married powerhouse couple in Japanese free jazz. Mori is a unique figure in jazz, really the greatest musician working mostly with laptops in the genre\u2019s history. None of these are easy artists (I\u2019ve seen Fujii and Tamura twice and it is challenging even for me, though there\u2019s always a strong sense of humor in the music), but this recording has a surprising accessibility to it. This is also one of those pandemic projects where they just sent files to each other and built the project that way, which at least in this case, worked really well. Mori is such an astounding artist with a unique approach to electronic music and Fujii such an arch pianist that you wouldn\u2019t think it would work this well in fact, especially given that Tamura is more of a bleater than a blower. But this is like something you\u2019ve never heard before and will want to hear again.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing on YouTube from this album and any live performance is going to be something quite different, but this is as good as I could do.\n\nA-\n\nDanny Kamins/Vinny Golia/Garrett Wingfield, The Ojai Sessions\n\nRecorded in 2018 but just released last year, this is a sax trio. I am most familiar with Golia, one of the most important musicians in the smaller west coast free jazz scene. He plays sopranino, soprano, baritone, and bass sax here (bass sax is a large instrument). Danny Kamins is on alto and baritone sax. Garrett Wingfield handles the tenor, as well as some alto and baritone. You might think would be a total sckroning blowout, but it really isn\u2019t. It begins is a very muted way and mostly stays that way. It\u2019s intense, even if not particularly loud. These are not guys playing Charlie Parker covers. These are guys who pushing envelopes on what the sax can do in conversation with other saxes. The obvious antecedent is World Saxophone Quartet, but the sound and style are totally different here than what those four legends are trying to do. It might seem a bit ridiculous to say that the down side of this is that it is more than a bit hard to listen to, but it is indeed more than a bit hard to listen to, even for a lover of free jazz. It\u2019s a lot. Great art isn\u2019t always easy. And if this is not quite great art, it is certainly worthy art.\n\nB\n\nSteve Dunn, Last Call\n\nDunn is an almost completely unknown singer songwriter. I saw a review of his album last year in an obscure publication, put it on the list. So I decided to check it out. This is only a little 7 song thing, barely more than an EP. But this guy has very real talent. These are some nice songs in the folk-country style. Not every one rises above the conventions of genre, but for people who like their singer-songwriter music, at the very least, this is someone who you ought to check out.\n\nB\n\nChes Smith, Interpret It Well\n\nFantastic, mostly low-key but almost threatening album as such. This takes a frequent Smith trio\u2013himself on drums, Craig Taborn on piano, Mat Maneri on viola\u2013and adds Bill Frisell\u2019s guitar. Now, these days a lot of Frisell\u2019s solo work has moved to pretty and, frankly, boring and my attempts to get friends into him have largely failed in recent years. But it is when he is using that amazing technique on other people\u2019s projects that his power really comes out today and since this is fairly contemplative music to being with, Frisell\u2019s spaces between notes blends well. Smith also plays some vibes here that only adds to the overall feeling. This project comes across as some weird combo of a chamber quartet, some spacey soundscapes, and some angry fury borrowed from musics that have nothing to do with these guys training but probably does in their listening habits.\n\nA\n\nVillano Antillano, La Sustancia X\n\nAs a person with highly questionable Spanish speakers, I didn\u2019t necessarily pick up from hearing this that this was an explicitly queer album, but this Puerto Rican rapper delivers the goods even if you don\u2019t know that. In fact, the story is perhaps more interesting than the music, as this is a trans rapper in a world and culture that doesn\u2019t necessarily have a lot of space for that. But, again, even without this knowledge, this is an album that clearly embraces hedonism and freedom while delivering an excellent flow behind Latin hip hop grooves. Not bad.\n\nB\n\nRon Sexsmith, The Vivian Line\n\nEvidently Canadians also play music? Who knew! As an American, I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing!\n\nAnyway, thought I\u2019d check out the new Ron Sexsmith. Confess I\u2019ve never paid him a ton of attention so I don\u2019t know his catalog well at all. And really, this is just a lovely little album. I am sure everyone who likes Sexsmith already knows this about his work, but it\u2019s really a perfect modern pop album, with pop as an older definition. The melody reigns supreme here and the songwriting is excellent. Mature music for mature people.\n\nA-\n\nArt Ensemble of Chicago, We Are on the Edge: A 50th Anniversary Celebration\n\nThough a 50th anniversary celebration of this great collective, I didn\u2019t find this to be among the Ensemble\u2019s best albums. The first disc is from the studio and the second is live .The latter is better, a combination of new tunes (many of which are repeated from the first disc, though obviously in somewhat different form) and rethinking some of the band\u2019s older compositions. Too often I found the first disc rather arid though, which has long been a problem I\u2019ve had with Roscoe Mitchell\u2019s work. I like some of it a lot but then some of it leaves me cold. This doesn\u2019t leave me cold exactly and any release from these people has great historical value. But there are better recordings of the band out there.\n\nB\n\nAnat Cohen, Quartetinho\n\nCohen is a leading modern clarinetist and this is from her quartet that includes Victor Gon\u00e7alves on keys and accordion, Tal Mashiach on bass, and James Shipp on vibes and drums. This is a great example of how modern jazz can move in new directions without necessarily being experimental or free jazz. To me, the point of jazz is to move the music forward, not repeat the styles of the past. You can be respectful of the past without just wishing you were playing with Dave Brubeck in 1960. This is not a noisy album. It\u2019s not experimental. What it does is take musical traditions from around the globe and let their rhythms and especially melodies enter into the conversation of post-bop jazz. That Cohen plays the clarinet and brings klezmer influences into the music already makes this somewhat different, but then you have clear Brazilian, Louisiana, and South African influences. You take all of this and put it into an incredibly tight band that know each other so well and you have just an incredibly listenable, repeatable album. Really liked this one, maybe more than I thought I would.\n\nA-\n\nSharon Van Etten, We\u2019ve Been Going About This All Wrong\n\nThis is Van Etten\u2019s release from last year. She\u2019s always been someone I respected more than really loved, part of a larger movement of neo indie folkies that too often can sound a bit too similar to each other, with maybe a bit too much yearning and maybe a bit too little kicking ass or just being angry. And this is mostly how I feel here. It\u2019s a very tuneful album with some lush production and Van Etten\u2019s signature voice. But for me, it doesn\u2019t really rise into the anything very different than what\u2019s come before it or to a new emotional or musical plane. It\u2019s the same songs about toxic relationships and trying to hold it together with the mid-tempo indie rock sound, even if she does expand that palette on a couple of songs. It\u2019s perfectly fine, yes. Good even. Just not, for me, a needed step forward. Her fans no doubt love it though. But she kind of a one-note artist.\n\nB-\n\nRasmussen/Flahtery/Rowden/Corsano, Crying in Space\n\nI always love a good self-description of a jazz album that is really impossible to describe in a way most people can understand. On Bandcamp, this is described as \u201cA blisteringly sensitive assaultive slow dash concerning the heartbreaking space between and within solids.\u201d Uh, OK. But \u201cblisteringly sensitive assault\u201d I can at least get behind as that\u2019s a good description. This is nice and noisy. The two saxes make approximately as much noise as ol\u2019 Octopus Arms Corsano does on his drums. Good example of the ways that free jazz and rock can intersect, even if the latter is more in attitude than in the style itself.\n\nA-\n\nEast Axis, No Subject\n\nA very solid new album from this quartet consisting of Matthew Shipp on piano, Scott Robinson on horns, Gerald Cleaver on drums, and Kevin Ray on bass. I enjoyed their 2021 release (though Allen Lowe was the sax player for that one) a good bit and am glad they are back with a new one. I don\u2019t really know Robinson, at least not before this, but he and Shipp sound incredible together. Robinson is kind of the star for this one, with Shipp and the others often working underneath him. This is a great example of four musicians working together in an atmosphere of both personal and collective freedom, expressing yourself within the collective, one of the most beautiful realizations of jazz one can find.\n\nA-\n\nSlowthai, Tyron\n\nA bit behind on the great British hip hop artist as he has a new album out and this is his 2021 release. But here we are. Maybe I will get to the new one in 2025. Now as for this one, I don\u2019t really know what it means to split a 35 minute album over 2 \u201cdiscs\u201d when 99% of the people are listening to it are streaming or own an electronic file of it, but whatever, who really cares. After nearly destroying his career with bad behavior at an awards show, slowthai came back with an album that splits the difference between serious introspection and the kind of boasting one knows you are likely to get on a hip hop album. If it\u2019s not his greatest album (and it\u2019s not Nothing Great About Britain, let\u2019s be clear here), it is at least thoughtful. Plus how many hip hop songs do you know that take the greatness of Britain\u2019s National Health Service as its topic?\n\nB+\n\nMy Morning Jacket, My Morning Jacket\n\nThere are bands you miss and there are bands that you really miss for twenty years knowing that you probably really should check them out. Then there are bands that you miss for twenty years that are headlining one of the nights at Newport Folk Festival next week and you finally just do it. Thus, My Morning Jacket. This is the self-titled album, which actually is their last release, from 2021.\n\nAnd yeah, I guess it is pretty much fine straight ahead rock and roll? Doesn\u2019t seem overly interesting to me. I am sure this will be fine live. The guitars are good. Does it stand up against most other good bands? Not so sure. Does this stand up against, say, Drive By Truckers? No freaking way. I am sure there are going to be staunch defenders in comments. Would like some explanation of the appeal.\n\nB-\n\nAs always, this is an open thread for all things music and art and none things politics.", "tiktoken_token_count": 5073, "llama_token_count": 5878}, {"source_name": "Louder", "author": "elizabeth.capewell@futurenet.com (Liz Scarlett)", "title": "The 10 best Stevie Nicks solo songs", "description": "Although often overshadowed by her efforts with Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Nicks' solo repertoire shines just as bright. We take a look at the very best of her songwriting sorcery", "url": "https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-best-stevie-nicks-solo-songs", "text": "A sizeable percentage of Stevie Nicks' best songs may have been released under the banner of Fleetwood Mac - the band that undoubtedly put her on the international map - but while enjoying the trappings of success as one fifth of the soft rock superstar act, the Phoenix, Arizona-born vocalist also established herself as a prolific and ground-breaking solo artist, proving that she could not only stand on her own two feet, but fly high without the help of her bandmates.\n\nHaving cemented herself as an unmistakable icon - being the only woman to be inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame twice - Nicks' work is celebrated for its complex and often beautiful untanglings of love and emotion, and of course, its otherworldly and enchanting mystique, straight from her own witchy and wild heart.\n\nFrom cocaine-addled '80s dance floor-fillers to bluesy ballads, these are the ten best songs of Stevie Nicks' solo career:\n\n1. Rooms On Fire - The Other Side Of The Mirror (1989)\n\nA bewitching track conceived from the fittingly ethereal surroundings of a mountain-top Dutch castle located in Beverly Hills, with Nicks turning to its 16th-century architecture, whimsy lavishness and antique artworks for inspiration. At the centre of it all however, was her intense new infatuation with producer Rupert Hine, who was part of her \"spiritual agreement\" to create a \"magic album\". Swathed in heady, rich romance, Rooms On Fire burns with an obsessive fervour about a fairytale meeting; the mysterious sixth sense that engulfs the room in metaphorical flames whenever that special someone walks nearby. Its music video was also filmed within the castle's walls, and is a gorgeously gothic fever dream.\n\n2. Think About It - Bella Donna (1981)\n\nOriginally written for the Rumours album, Think About It was born from the most explosive period of Fleetwood Mac\u2019s history. At the time, keyboardist/songwriter Christine McVie was in the midst of a divorce with bassist John, and Nicks\u2019 relationship with then-boyfriend Buckingham was on its final legs; neither woman wanted to be in the band with their ex-partners. The track was the co-frontwoman\u2019s ode of encouragement to them both, to keep going and focus on their love of creating music, rather than the relationships they were leaving behind; they could, and would, stay with Fleetwood Mac. A song of succour for times of hardship, with bittersweet lyrics and an uplifting melody that's as comforting as a blanket around the shoulders, and a heartfelt conversation shared with an old friend.\n\n3. Stop Draggin' My Heart Around - Bella Donna (1981)\n\nNicks' debut Bella Donna may have reached the top of the charts, but before its release, producer Jimmy Iovine was concerned that the record didn't contain a hit single, and suggested that Nicks link up with Tom Petty to work on Stop Draggin' My Heart Around, a track originally reserved for the band's 1981 album Hard Promises, as the introduction to her album.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the writing credit, Nicks owns the song, her throaty purr blending seamlessly with Petty's smoother higher-pitched croon, as bluesy organs vamp around them, swapping stinging lines in a sassy faux lover's tryst. This tender, angst-soaked blues rock number, initially crafted to give Nicks a fighting chance of getting her feet out the door as a gratified solo artist, would go on to be one of her biggest ever hits. It would also lay the foundations of her lifelong friendship with Petty, a bond which would see her later dubbed as the honorary fifth member of The Heartbreakers, simultaneously granting Nicks' former wish of joining the band and breaking their old rule of there being \"no girls allowed\".\n\n4. Leather And Lace - Bella Donna (1981)\n\nThis folksy lullaby-like ballad is considered by Nicks to be \u201cone of the most special love songs\u201d she\u2019s ever written. A vulnerable reflection on her previous relationships with bandmate Lindsey Buckingham and the Eagles\u2019 Don Henley (who actually duets with her on the track), the song marries dainty, twinkling keys and gentle acoustic guitar strums with honey-sweet lyrics about two personalities coming together to balance out each other\u2019s differences; night and light, the city and mountains, leather and lace. Initially intended to be sung by Waylon Jennings and his then-wife Jessi Colter, Nicks took back the track after finding out the pair were planning on breaking up. A smart move.\n\n5. Sorcerer - Trouble In Shangri-La (2001)\n\nWhile the official (and greatest) take of this track was created in 2001 with Sheryl Crow for Nicks\u2019 Trouble In Shangri-La album, another version of Sorcerer was recorded during the Wild Heart sessions in 1983, following its even earlier origins in 1972, when it was written during her tenure as part of folk duo Buckingham Nicks with then-boyfriend and future Fleetwood Mac bandmate Lindsey Buckingham. The noughties' release leans into the original; stripped-back, raw guitar plucks like the sound of autumnal crunching leaves, earthy and cosy, the feeling of being back in home territory. During the track\u2019s creation, Nicks was grappling with her new life in Hollywood, surrounded by \u201cblack ink darkness\u201d and the garish glamour of the area; a place worlds away from her life as a \u201clady from the mountains\u201d. Bluesy and western-tinged, Sorcerer remains one of Nicks\u2019 most soulfully unpolished releases to date, reflective of a calmer epoch of her career.\n\n6. Wild Heart - The Wild Heart (1983)\n\nIf you thought Kate Bush\u2019s Wuthering Heights was the only famous pop rock song to be inspired by the 1847 Emily Bront\u00eb novel of the same name, you may be surprised to know that Nick\u2019s Wild Heart, the title-track of her 1983 album, was also derived from the doomed romance of the story\u2019s characters Heathcliff and Cathy. Written as a way of supporting listeners through their own moments of heartbreak, the seven minute-long track is driven by a marching, resolute rhythm and defiant vocals about having an emotionally intense heart. As Nicks once noted: \"it takes you through your nervous breakdown and through your recovery, and it takes you through your survival.\" It was first unveiled during a Rolling Stone cover photoshoot.\n\n7. Talk To Me - Rock A Little (1985)\n\nThis fist-clenching power ballad may not have been written by Nicks - it was actually helmed by Chas Sandford, who co-wrote John Waite's 1984 hit Missing You, which does sound somewhat similar - but we can't imagine it climbing the charts as well as it did (peaking at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and the top spot on Billboard Top Mainstream Rock Songs) without the husky rasp of her vocal behind it to level out the saccharine pop-heavy schmaltz. With direct lyrics about encouraging a lover to unveil their hidden emotions, Talk To Me is definitely one of Nicks' most romantically upfront tracks; a glittering sappy love letter, whimsical and warm.\n\n8. I Can't Wait - Rock A Little (1985)\n\nIf there ever was a song that perfectly encapsulated the 80s era, it would be Stevie Nicks\u2019 I Can\u2019t Wait; a cocaine-fuelled, heat-in-the-moment rush through the dizzying heights of love and rockstar excess, a song that is even apparently required for the listener to let themselves go \u201ca little crazy\u201d to properly understand it. Bursting with hyperactivity, as recorded in Zo\u00eb Howe\u2019s book Stevie Nicks: Visions, Dreams and Rumours, following its one-and-done recording session - where Nicks sang the vocal part in a single take to capture the track\u2019s spontaneous magic - she danced wildly through the night with her friends, playing the song on a constant repeat. To top things off, it comes with a bonkers music video which sees Nicks and an entourage of backup dancers (including her younger brother, Chris) stomping up and down a staircase while being blasted by wind machines.\n\n9. Stand Back - The Wild Heart (1983)\n\nOpening with a palpitating bass synth line that could easily shake a room if played through an adequate-enough sound system, Stand Back, as Nicks previously described herself, \u201cstarts with an energy that comes from somewhere unknown\u2026and it seems to have no time-space\u201d. Darkly cosmic, the song soon expands in colour, diving into a magnificently funky guitar piece from Prince, who found his way onto the track after Nicks revealed how it was derived from his own Little Red Corvette, which she first discovered via her car radio while on a drive to her honeymoon with Kim Anderson in 1983. Prince and Nicks imbued the song with their two polarising personalities to create a sparkling and shadowy pop classic, which became the lead single to her second studio album The Wild Heart.\n\n10. Edge Of Seventeen - Bella Donna (1981)\n\nEdge Of Seventeen stands as the definitive track of Stevie Nicks\u2019 solo career; a jubilant and bohemian swansong that encapsulates everything that fuels the Fleetwood Mac frontwoman\u2019s songwriting; heartbreak, loss, magic and mystery. While it might be coloured by a celebratory feel, peaked by a dramatic chorus, the track is far less a jovial paean than it is a poignant nod to tragedy, spurred on by the \u201cviolent death\u201d of John Lennon and Nicks\u2019 uncle Bill, who died shortly after from cancer in 1981. The track also harks back to the wilderness of her formative years in Phoenix, and the mysterious \u201cwhite-winged dove\u201d that resides there. \u201cTo me, the white-winged dove was for John Lennon the dove of peace, and for my uncle, it was the white-winged dove who lives in the saguaro cactus\u2026and it does make a sound like \u2018whooo, whooo, whooo\u2019\u201d she once noted, speaking of the lyrics.", "tiktoken_token_count": 2125, "llama_token_count": 2550}, {"source_name": "Jalopnik", "author": "Erin Marquis", "title": "Watch Just How Aggravating A Ride In A Self-Driving Taxi Can Be", "description": "What seemed like a simple trip turned into an odyssey of false starts and dodgy behavior after one San Francisco journalist attempted to take a Waymo self-driving taxi to a small local museum.Read more...", "url": "https://jalopnik.com/watch-just-how-aggravating-a-ride-in-a-self-driving-tax-1850595429", "text": "What seemed like a simple trip turned into an odyssey of false starts and dodgy behavior after one San Francisco journalist attempted to take a Waymo self-driving taxi to a small local museum.\n\nSan Francisco residents are fairly fed up with their streets being used as a testing ground for the emerging technology. Robotaxi complaints are way up in the Bay Area, especially after two cars blocked traffic on a busy weekend. Journalist Lyanne Melendez at ABC 7 was initially excited to take her first trip in a self-driving taxi. The plan was to pick up her son from the nearby Randall Museum. She expressed confidence in the Waymo\u2019s safe driving, despite the car stopping to pick her up on a completely opposite corner half a block away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen the problems really began.\n\nTV journalist documents wild ride inside Waymo self-driving car in San Francisco\n\nMelendez\u2019s inaugural trip was marred by her taxi stalling in the middle of a lane at a green light. It took several seconds and contact with the Waymo team to get the car moving again. This should have been a simple maneuver\u2014really, one of the simplest a human driver can make, but the robotaxi botched it.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe next screw-up came when the taxi turned the wrong way and dropped Melendez off in front of a house with instructions for her to climb a very steep hill full of cactus and succulents and walk a further 5 minutes up to the museum. She was forced to call support, which told her to give the car another go at figuring out where it needed to be. The taxi then looped the block only to drop Melendez off in front of the same house.\n\n\u201cHad there been a driver here I would have said \u201cHey, you know, this is the wrong location! and I\u2019d give him the instructions except there\u2019s nobody here right now,\u201d she said in the video. She points out sure, she could scramble up the steep hill and walk to the museum, but what about people who are less physically able (the people self-driving cars are supposed to help the most) or have small children or a load of groceries. And really, it\u2019s providing a different level of service than requested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the end, Melendez drove her own car the relatively simple route to pick up her son from the Randall Museum. You don\u2019t have to be riding in a self-driving taxi for these new pieces of technology to totally derail your day, of course. San Francisco residents have pretty much had it with being a sandbox for self-driving car developers. The taxis have disrupted first responders, trapped public transit, and cause traffic jams across the city.\n\nRight now, the taxis are limited in where and when they can operate, but those limits are also lifting.

All opinions expressed are those of the author.\n\nMinifigures\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Dream World is populated by countless unusual characters, many of whom appear in the LEGO range. However, odd characters can also be found in the Waking World, including Mrs. Castillo! An interesting dual-moulded element forms her dress and backpack, with the arms introduced in the Super Mario theme plugged into either side.\n\nTheir shape seems decidedly unnatural, so I would have preferred the arms developed for the Minions to be re-used instead. Otherwise, the minifigure looks marvellous. The reddish brown backpack is neatly constructed from an ingot and a 2x1 bow, but could be easily adapted with other accoutrements, depending on Mrs. Castillo's needs during her adventures.\n\nOnly the double-sided head and white hair component are retained from standard minifigures and these convey plenty of personality. The decoration on the dress looks lovely as well, even though the white lotus designs are hardly noticeable against the aqua piece. They are visible in renders of the minifigure, but are much less obvious in reality.\n\nMateo is the protagonist of DREAMZzz and appears in many sets accordingly, so it is fortunate that his minifigure is excellent. The new hair piece is brilliantly textured and its green highlights look nice, corresponding with Mateo's green eye. The torso also features a green strap, which connects to a belt element in other sets. That is omitted here to accommodate a backpack, but the minifigure does feature dual-moulded legs.\n\nDespite appearances, Zoey does not include dual-moulded legs. Nonetheless, her minifigure also captures impressive detail, again featuring a new hair element with fantastic texture. The purple shade is not easily adaptable for other characters, but I hope this piece appears in other colours soon. However, purple hair suits this minifigure, complementing Zoey's dark blue and lavender attire.\n\nBoth characters display the Dream Chasers' hourglass symbol, which is also printed on top of Zoey's accessory. A purple bow is also provided, while Mateo carries his brick-built pencil staff. Originally a normal pencil, the staff incorporates a 4L bar and a lightsaber hilt in flame yellowish orange, an uncommon colour for these parts.\n\nThe pencil staff suits Mateo, given his love of drawing. That skill brought Z-Blob into existence, a gooey creature able to transform its body. Four versions of the character are available across the range and this example includes the trans-bright green piece designed for the Slime Singer from VIDIYO, albeit without decoration. The eyes are printed on a bright green minifigure head underneath instead.\n\nZ-Blob also incorporates a new body component, shared with a Grimspawn. These nightmare creatures serve the Nightmare King and many are inspired by existing LEGO themes, hence this character wears a knight's helmet. Also, the trans-pink flame is shared by a number of Grimspawn, as they seem to burn with energy in the animated series.\n\nThe new body piece is proportionally similar to the now-retired microfigures launched in 2009, albeit featuring a separate head on this occasion. This provides much greater opportunity for customisation and the figures can even interact with accessories because their arms fit over anything with the width of a standard bar, as shown below.\n\nThe Completed Model\n\nMrs. Castillo serves burritos from her van in the Waking World, although adaptations have been made for this set, so the van sells Dream Crafting equipment. The sand green and white colour scheme remains intact from the animation though, while the shape of the vehicle is familiar too. Evidently inspired by the Volkswagen Camper Van, I expect some will customise the design for LEGO City.\n\nThe vehicle is eight studs wide, which is relatively substantial, but the designer has definitely taken advantage of that size. For instance, windscreen wipers are included and the doors are functional. A printed Dream Chasers' symbol adorns the front and stickers are applied on the top and side, hinting towards the potential transformation into the Turtle Van.\n\nMrs. Castillo's pet turtle, Se\u00f1or Tortuga, is sadly not included, but I like the sticker alluding to him on the side. There is room for two minifigures inside the cab, including Mrs. Castillo, despite her unusual body shape. The roof is detachable to reach the interior, which continues into the back of the van, where minifigures can stand to serve customers.\n\nA few more stickers form a striped awning and signage, advertising Tortuga's Dreamcraft Shop and three of the items available to buy. The serving window looks good, but I dislike the visible studs and clips underneath. While these are needed for the transformation, the exterior is very smooth elsewhere, so perhaps they could have been disguised for the van's appearance in the Waking World.\n\nThe items advertised outside are found inside the van, including a potion, a trans-opalescent blue crystal and a mushroom. I appreciate such continuity and the patterned floor, but there is ample space for additional accessories and more are supplied for the van's Dream World forms. These are shown on a blackboard, but not used in the instructions at this stage, strangely.\n\nSand green is a new colour for the 2x4x2 wheel arches, which look brilliant in combination with the wheels. This is partly because the wheels are actually offset by half a stud, as 1x2 plates with side rails inside prevent the Technic pins moving too far inwards or protruding too much. Another sticker forms the number plate on the back and features the initials of the set designer, Freddy Charters.\n\nUpon entering the Dream World, the whole van becomes a shell for Se\u00f1or Tortuga. The turtle's legs sprout from the wheels and his head appears on the front, connected to a ball joint. A few accessories are added on top too, alongside Cat Cactus. Once these features are added, the vehicle looks wonderfully wacky, so fits seamlessly into the realm of DREAMZzz.\n\nThe head comprises a printed shoulder armour piece and a 1x4 curved window frame, which has not appeared in flame yellowish orange before. The seam between them forms the mouth and the head can move up and down, but sideways motion is very limited. Also, the legs can be positioned as though walking by swapping the curved tube elements around, even though only the feet are actually articulated.\n\nMrs. Castillo seemingly directs Se\u00f1or Tortuga by dangling a carrot above him, although the rod holding the carrot should be longer, especially because the turtle cannot actually look upwards. The weapons sketched on the aforementioned blackboard are also mounted on the van in this format, connecting to those clips beneath the serving window.\n\nVarious apparently unrelated items are placed on the roof, including a treasure chest, a small palm tree and the mysterious Cat Cactus. This character is present in 71459 Stable of Dream Creatures too, residing in a medium nougat pot and featuring a printed dome. These additions to the van can only be described as bizarre, as I would expect in the Dream World.\n\nTurtles are not known for their speed, but it seems swapping Se\u00f1or Tortuga's carrot for a chilli pepper sends him into overdrive! A periscope and fin replace the array of items on top in this configuration, while Cat Cactus' pot becomes a thruster. Also, the legs are reconstructed as though swept back by the sheer speed of the vehicle.\n\nI imagine this will be the least popular of the three possible designs, although I think the rocket-propelled turtle is a fun concept. The dual-moulded flame on the back looks superb, combining flame yellowish orange and trans-yellow plastics. This piece is available in several DREAMZzz sets and in five different colours, but the yellow-tinted version only appears twice.\n\nCat Cactus also becomes rocket-propelled, as the trans-purple flame used as a blade earlier becomes a thruster. In addition, the cactus' pink flower is replaced with a golden spike on top and a saddle for a minifigure is connected to the back, presumably because this is considered the cactus' battle mode!\n\nNot every piece is used for each of the Turtle Van's configurations, but this one includes almost all of them. The treasure chest and palm tree, for instance, are attached on a 4x4 round plate, previously used to display the weapons. A crystal is found inside the chest and the palm tree looks fantastic, making excellent use of the fern components introduced in 10316 The Lord of the Rings: Rivendell.\n\nOverall\n\nComparisons have been drawn between DREAMZzz and the sets from The LEGO Movie, as both include relatively mundane subjects that can transform into something fantastical. 71456 Mrs. Castillo's Turtle Van undoubtedly lives up to this comparison. The outlandish nature of the design will not appeal to everyone, but I find it charming, especially given the ponderous turtle mode.\n\nThe three options for building the Turtle Van are appealing and you can switch between them quickly, as they only require partial reassembly. However, not all the pieces are used for each design, which could lead to concerns about the price of \u00a342.99, $47.99 or \u20ac47.99. That seems expensive to me, but I still find the set appealing on the whole.", "tiktoken_token_count": 2148, "llama_token_count": 2607}, {"source_name": "Southernsavers.com", "author": "Jenny", "title": "Lowes Foods Unadvertised Deals: 6/28-7/4", "description": "Here is a list of the Lowes foods unadvertised deals I found at my store this week.

The Houston rapper explains that this particular piece of artwork was shot by Pieter Hugo and that Travis will be unveiling more of the album's covers each day leading up to Utopia's release.\n\n\"THIS IS ONE OF THE COVERS FOR MY 4TH ALBUM UTOPIA,\" Travis Scott reveals in the caption of the photo below. \"SHOT BY PIETER HUGO. THE JOURNEY THRU THE ALBUM TOOK ME ALL OVER THE WORLD AND CANT WAIT TO FINALLY DROP THE ALBUM.\n\nTHE MAIN COVER WILL DROP THURS. UNTIL THEN A COVER EVERYDAY LOVE U SEE U IN UTOPIA.\"\n\nTravis Scott Previews New Circus Maximus Movie\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Travis Scott offered his 50.5 million Instagram followers a glimpse of the upcoming movie he's been working on, Circus Maximus. Described as a \"mind-bending visual odyssey\" that captures Travis' worldly experiences across the planet, Utopia actually serves as the film's soundtrack. The official movie trailer can be seen in the video below as Travis explains that not only does he star in the flick, which premieres in theaters on July 27, but he wrote and directed Circus Maximus along with a number of filmmakers he gathered from around the world.\n\n\"AHHHHHH CANT BELIEVE WE FINALLLLY HEREEEEEEEEEEEE !!!\" Travis Scott exclaims in the Instagram preview's caption. \"LETSSS EATTTTT. CIRCUS MAXIMUS IN THEATRES ON 7/27. I WROTE ANS DIRECTED THIS ALONG SIDE WITH SOME OF MY FAVORITE DIRECTORS WE FOUND UTOPIA AROUND THE WORLD AND CANT WAIT TO EXPERIENCE THIS WITH U SEEE U IN UTOPIA.\"\n\nWhat Do We Know About Travis Scott's Utopia Album?\n\nTravis Scott's Utopia album and the details surrounding it have been giving off mysterious vibes throughout all of 2023. However, on Saturday (July 22), Cactus Jack announced the long-awaited LP's release date live on stage at Rolling Loud Miami. To coincide with his large-scale performance of the album at the Pyramid of Giza in Egypt on the same date, Utopia is set to drop this coming Friday (July 28). The album's lead single, \"K-POP\" featuring The Weeknd and Bad Bunny, has already mustered up nearly seven million views on YouTube since its July 21 release.\n\nRead More: Travis Scott Confirms Utopia Release Date and New Movie to Go with It\n\nCheck out the first of what will be five Utopia album covers and catch the trailer for Travis Scott's Circus Maximus movie below.\n\nSee the First of Five Utopia Album Covers and Watch Travis Scott's Circus Maximus Movie Preview Below", "tiktoken_token_count": 656, "llama_token_count": 822}, {"source_name": "Minneapolis Star Tribune", "author": "Jon Bream", "title": "6 cool things in music this week: Boygenius, Lucinda Williams, Billy Bob Thornton", "description": "Shoutouts, too, to Muna, Indigo De Souza and Wild Nights at the Minnesota Zoo.", "url": "https://www.startribune.com/boygenius-lucinda-williams-billy-bob-thornton-boxmasters-minnesota-zoo-muna-indigo-de-souza/600289634/", "text": "A half-dozen cool things in music, from two points of view:\n\nSarah Horner, Minnesota Daily writer, Minneapolis:\n\n1 Indigo De Souza, \"All of This Will End.\" A gut-wrenching yet self-assured album that explores what it means to exist in uncertainty and embrace the unknown. \"I'm only loving, only moving through and trying my best,\" she exclaims in the title track.

A highlight was the country version of their hit \"Silk Chiffon,\" which played into their semi-ironic cowboy aesthetic and showcased their vocals. These acoustic versions as Spotify singles, please!\n\nJon Bream, Star Tribune critic:\n\n1 Wild Nights at the Minnesota Zoo. Every other Thursday this summer, the zoo is presenting three stages of local bands with a theme. The setup is very good (plenty of food trucks, stages far enough apart), and last week's Americana lineup \u2014 including Cactus Blossoms, Turn Turn Turn and the bluegrassy Chicken Wire Empire \u2014 was rewarding.

A rusting stove lays just off the dusty trail near the ruins of a homestead \u2014 dreams of a new life cut short by the harsh environment.\n\nFarther along, we encounter the Dolores Mission ruins with the adjacent cemetery.\n\nAfter the Mexican-American War ended, a group of Mexican immigrants led by Damascio L\u00f3pez that included 11 families \u201cestablished the first permanent settlement in the canyon lands,\u201d according the Grassland website.\n\nAt first, the community was without a local priest or church.\n\n\u201cIn 1898, Damascio sold 0.11-acres of his land to the Denver Diocese for $1.00. The community then built a church called the Dolores Mission,\u201d the website said.\n\nOur group stopped to inspect the graveyard\u2019s headstones with one indicating a child lived for one week.\n\n\u201cI just know they had a lot of children that didn\u2019t make it and you see a lot of those tombstones of young people that lived in these harsh, harsh conditions that just is a testimony to people\u2019s perseverance and their ability to try things that are \u2026 so challenging and just how people would relocate their families down there, it just shows the human spirit at its fullest,\u201d Carlos L\u00f3pez said in a recent interview.\n\nThe canyon yields more clues of earlier times with Native American petroglyphs including designs of hands and figures etched into rock slabs.\n\n\u201cYou think about how the Native peoples have been in that canyon for thousands and thousands of years and made all that artwork on the rocks,\u201d noted Leigh.\n\nFor Carlos, the petroglyphs are one of the most interesting aspects of the trek.\n\n\u201cI love the petroglyphs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt think it just leaves the mind to wander as to what these primitive people were thinking when they were creating these artistic memoirs of sorts that are left behind for everyone to kind of speculate on.\u201d\n\nLunch surrounded by dinosaur ghosts\n\nAfter about 2 1/2 hours, we reach the tracks and cross the river on stepping stones to break for lunch and explore.\n\nAlong both sides of the river there are about 1,900 footprints representing 130 trackways that extend almost a quarter-mile, according to the Forest Service.\n\nInterpretive signage states that while today\u2019s Purgatoire River winds through a rugged and arid landscape at the time several different types of dinosaurs left their mark, the land was a vast shallow lake with a conifer forest and ferns. Those dinosaurs included the plant-eating Brontosaurus and meat-eating Allosaurus.\n\nThe herds left their footprints in mud, which was later sunbaked and then turned to stone. The river\u2019s waters revealed the tracks and now those same waters are starting to erode them, but the Forest Service uses erosion control structures to preserve the site.\n\nCarlos L\u00f3pez wondered what else might be hidden.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wondering what else is under there that they haven\u2019t exposed because it\u2019s a pretty large site but you know if you keep digging you are going to find more. But I think they have left it that way to preserve them. But they are ever-changing because of the way the water flows through there.\u201d\n\nSerious precautions needed: no potable water, no cellphone coverage\n\nThe Picket Wire Canyonlands is a serious place as the warning signs indicate. Two people died here in 2017 within a half-mile of the trailhead.\n\n\u201cTurn around before your water is one-half gone,\u201d states one sign. \u201cHiking into the canyon is OPTIONAL, hiking out of the canyon is MANDATORY,\u201d says another.\n\nA couple recently inquired about hiking there, said Leigh L\u00f3pez.\n\n\u201cI advised against going in the summer months. It\u2019s way too hot down there,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you get into that canyon it can get really warm really fast and there is not a lot of tree cover, there is not a lot shade.\u201d\n\nDrink and take plenty of water, she advised. \u201cIt\u2019s not a hard trek but it is a long trek.\u201d\n\nThe Forest Service advises to leave early and take at least gallon of water per person.\n\nIf you go\n\nFishers Peak Outfitters, Trinidad; fisherspeakoutfitters.com; 719-422-8223; 304 Main St., Trinidad, CO.

It reached 117 degrees (47.2 Celsius) by 3 p.m.\n\nHuman-caused climate change and a newly formed El Nino are combining to shatter heat records worldwide, scientists say.\n\nNo other major city \u2013 defined as the 25 most populous in the United States \u2013 has had any stretch of 110-degree (43.3-degree) days or 90-degree (32.2-degree) nights longer than Phoenix, said weather historian Christopher Burt of the Weather Company.\n\n\u201cWhen you have several million people subjected to that sort of thermal abuse, there are impacts,\u201d said NOAA Climate Analysis Group Director Russell Vose, who chairs a committee on national records.\n\nFor Phoenix, it\u2019s not only the brutal daytime highs that are deadly. The lack of a nighttime cooldown can rob people without access to air conditioning of the break their bodies need to function properly.\n\nWith Tuesday\u2019s low of 94 F (34.4 C), the city has had nine straight days of temperatures that didn\u2019t go below 90 F (32.2 C) at night, breaking another record there, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Salerno, who called it \u201cpretty miserable when you don\u2019t have any recovery overnight.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the city also set a record for the hottest overnight low temperature: 95 F (35 C). During the day, the heat built up so early that the city hit the 110 mark a couple minutes before noon.\n\nDog parks emptied out by the mid-morning and evening concerts and other outdoor events were cancelled to protect performers and attendees. The city\u2019s Desert Botanical Garden, a vast outdoor collection of cactus and other desert plants, over the weekend began shutting down at 2 p.m. before the hottest part of the day.\n\nIn the hours before the new record was set, rivers of sweat streamed down the sunburned face of Lori Miccichi, 38, as she pushed a shopping cart filled with her belongings through downtown Phoenix, looking for a place to get out of the heat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been out here a long time and homeless for about three years,\u201d said Miccichi. \u201cWhen it\u2019s like this, you just have to get into the shade. This last week has been the hottest I ever remember.\u201d\n\nSome 200 cooling and hydration centers have been set up across the metro area, but most shut down between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. due to staffing and funding issues.\n\nThe entire globe has simmered to record heat both in June and July. Nearly every day of this month, the global average temperature has been warmer than the unofficial hottest day recorded before 2023, according to University of Maine\u2019s Climate Reanalyzer. U.S. weather stations have broken more than 860 heat records in the past seven days, according to NOAA.\n\nRome reached an all-time high of 109 (42.9 degrees Celsius), with record heat reported throughout Italy, France, Spain and parts of China. Catalonia smashed records reaching 113 (45 Celsius), according to global weather record keeper Maximiliano Herrera.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough, smoke from wildfires, floods and droughts have caused problems globally.\n\nIn addition to Phoenix, Vose and others found less populous places such as Death Valley and Needles, California; and Casa Grande, Arizona, with longer hot streaks, but none in locations where many people live. Death Valley has had an 84-day streak of 110-degree temperatures.\n\nThe last time Phoenix didn\u2019t reach 110 F (43.3 C) was June 29, when it hit 108 (42.2 C). The record of 18 days above 110 that was tied Monday was first set in 1974.\n\n\u201cThis will likely be one of the most notable periods in our health record in terms of deaths and illness,\u201d said David Hondula, chief heat officer for the city. \u201cOur goal is for that not to be the case.\u201d\n\nPhoenix City Parks and Recreation workers Joseph Garcia, 48, and Roy Galindo, 28, tried to stay cool as they trimmed shrubs. They work from 5 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. to avoid the hottest time of the day.\n\n\u201cIt gets super hot out here and sometimes we have to take care of the public,\u201d said Galindo, adding he sometimes find people passed out on the grass. \u201cA lot of these people aren\u2019t drinking water.\u201d\n\nRetired Phoenix firefighter Mark Bracy, who has lived in the city most of his 68 years, went on a two-hour morning climb Tuesday, up and down Piestewa Peak, which is 2,610 feet (796 meters) high.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been going up there regularly since I was in the Cub Scouts, but it was never this hot back then,\u201d said Bracy. \u201cWe\u2019ve had hot spells before, but never anything like this.\u201d\n\nDr. Erik Mattison, director of the emergency department at Dignity Health Chandler Regional Medical Center in metro Phoenix, recalled a hiker in his 60s who was brought in last week with a core body temperature of 110 degrees (43.3 C).\n\n\u201cHeat makes people sick. Heat makes people die,\u201d Mattison said.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just older people,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen professional athletes fall ill in the heat during training camp.\u201d\n\nPhoenix\u2019s heat wave has both long and short-term causes, said Arizona State University\u2019s Randy Cerveny, who coordinates weather record verification for the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nLong-term high temperatures over recent decades are due to human activity, he said, while the short-term cause is high pressure over the western United States.\n\nThat high pressure, also known as a heat dome, has been around the Southwest cooking it for weeks. When it moved, it moved to be even more centered on Phoenix, said National Weather Service meteorologist Isaac Smith.\n\nThe Southwest high pressure not only brings the heat, it prevents cooling rain and clouds from bringing relief, Smith said. Normally, the Southwest\u2019s monsoon season kicks in around June 15 with rain and clouds. But Phoenix has not had measurable rain since mid-March.\n\n\u201cThis heat wave is intense and unrelenting,\u201d said Katharine Jacobs, director of the Center for Climate Adaptation Science and Solutions at the University of Arizona. \u201cUnfortunately, it is a harbinger of things to come.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment\n\n___\n\nBorenstein reported from Washington.

Wild Nights: The terrific Music in the Zoo series produced by Sue McLean & Associates is history. This summer, the Minnesota Zoo is showcasing local acts on themed Thursdays on three stages \u2014 the old reliable Weesner Family Amphitheater, the Lakeside Terrace (by the zoo's man-made lake) and the Crossroads Stage. The concerts this week focus on Americana and alt-country sounds, with those harmonizing brothers the Cactus Blossoms and the retro-loving trio Turn Turn Turn plus Chicken Wire Empire, Barbaro, JoJo Green and Wisconsin's Trapper Schoepp. Free parking. (6-10 p.m. Minnesota Zoo, 13000 Zoo Blvd., Apple Valley, $30-$40, mnzoo.org)\n\nAlso: The \"Summer Girls: A Boy Band Tribute\" will feature an all-female cast of Twin Cities singers all 'n sync and going in one direction together, including the Prairie Fire Lady Choir, Annie Enneking of Annie & the Bang Bang, Leslie Vincent and more (8 p.m. Turf Club, $12-$15); veteran guitarist Peter White, who has worked extensively with Al Stewart and Basia, is a smooth-jazz artist in his own right, who will be joined by young saxophonist Vincent Ingala (6:30 & 8:30 p.m. the Dakota, $35-$45); Alan Sparhawk's and Al Church's psychedelic funk-rock band Derecho returns to Icehouse (9 p.m., $12-$17), preceded by an outdoor dinnertime set by experimental groovers Martin Dosh and Jeremy Ylvisaker (6-8 p.m., $5); the Piano Men, namely former Minnesotans Jimmy Martin (Ivories Restaurant and Cabaret) and Drew Jansen (\"How To Talk Minnesotan: The Musical,\" \"Church Basement Ladies\"), return from Little Rock, Ark., for music and merriment (7 p.m. Crooners, $25-$35); wear your dancing shoes for Salsa del Sol (7 p.m. Downtown Park, Hopkins, free).\n\nFriday, July 7\n\n2. Jelly Roll: He's an unlikely country star. A 300-pound rapper who, like Merle Haggard and Johnny Paycheck, has done time in prison and sings about it. Jelly also sings about weed, booze, addiction, love, church, sin and redemption. At 39, he's put out 17 albums, but he didn't break out until last year's No. 1 country smash \"Son of a Sinner,\" in which he declares he's looking for new ways to get gone. This summer, Jelly dropped the skillfully crafted, country-focused \"Whitsitt Chapel,\" featuring tunes he co-wrote with Miranda Lambert, Hardy, Brantley Gilbert and Ashley McBryde. (8 p.m. Mystic Lake Amphitheater, 2400 Mystic Lake Blvd. NW, Prior Lake, sold out the day tickets went on sale, ticketmaster.com)\n\nAlso: Shawn Phillips, the Texas guitar virtuoso with a four-octave vocal range who was beloved by KQRS listeners in the 1970s, takes a break from his EMT duties to hit the road with his music (8 p.m. Fitzgerald Theater, $29.50 and up); Orkestar Bez Ime (Bulgarian for \"orchestra without a name\") is a Minnesota ensemble that for 20 years has been celebrating the music of Eastern Europe and its gypsy people (8 p.m. Crooners' Belvedere tent, $20-$30); the Festival of Organs continues with renowned British organist Wayne Marshall (7:30 p.m. Northrop, $15-$30); the final results of First Avenue's Rock Lottery mashup of local musicians will be on display in the Mainroom with participants including Bad Bad Hats' Kerry Alexander, L.A. Buckner, Mary Cutrufello and Christy Costello (8 p.m., $15).\n\n\n\nSaturday, July 8\n\n3. Trampled by Turtles at Bayfront: After a string of high-profile opening dates with Zach Bryan and Willie Nelson in recent months, the Duluth-bred acoustic sextet will be the king of its own domain again. The band's almost-annual outdoor concert is always loaded with homecoming sentimentality, being a mile and a half down Superior Street from where its members' first performed together at Sir Benedict's Tavern in 2003. Yep, that makes this unofficially the band's 20th anniversary party. Maybe an even bigger selling point this year is having longtime pal Jenny Lewis as the opener, following the release of the Los Angeles Americana-pop queen's excellent new record, \"Joy'all.\" Duluth's own Ross Thorn opens after winning TBT's Palomino grant. (6 p.m. Bayfront Festival Park, Duluth, resale tickets only, axs.com)\n\n4. Rob Zombie: One of metal's greatest showmen is back at it on an outdoor summer outing dubbed the Freaks on Parade Tour with Ministry and \"Hey Man Nice Shot\" hitmakers Filter as alternating openers; we get the latter act here. The ex-White Zombie namesake frontman has brought back his late-'90s-era guitarist Mike Riggs after longtime player John 5 left to join M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. He's also bringing out a new array of horror-movie-worthy visual gimmicks and songs from his strong, pandemic-issued album \"The Lunar Injection Kool Aid Eclipse Conspiracy.\" (8 p.m., Mystic Lake Casino Amphitheater, 2400 Mystic Lake Blvd. NW, Prior Lake, $55-$99, ticketmaster.com)\n\n5. O.A.R. and Cory Wong: After an afternoon all-star hockey game (featuring Joe Mauer, Mikko Koivu, Natalie Darwitz, Wong and others) at Tria Rink, it will be hockey night in Minneapolis. This Minnesota Wild-promoted charity concert features the \"Love and Memories\" hitmakers from Maryland, who are touring behind their 10th album, 2022's \"The Arcade,\" which has an unmistakable ska flavor. Count on Minnesota's own guitar star Wong to score big because he's as delightfully entertaining live as he is funkily musical. He collaborated with O.A.R. on his new pop single, the escapist \"Hiding on the Moon,\" from his Aug. 18 release, \"The Lucky One.\" (7:30 p.m. the Armory, 500 S. 6th St., Mpls., $47 and up, ticketmaster.com)\n\nAlso: South Minneapolis singer/songwriter Craig Paquette of the classic rock-flavored Thunderheads celebrates his new album \"Back Together,\" based on 1940s-era poems he found from his grandfather (7:30 p.m. Parkway Theater, $15-$20); Louisiana's Geminii Dragon brings her blues/rock/soul stew stirred with a raspy voice (8 p.m. Granada Theater, $20-$25); experimental San Francisco band Deerhoof returns touting its 19th album, \"Miracle Level,\" the first sung entirely in singer/bassist Satomi Matsuzaki's native Japanese (8:30 p.m. Turf Club, $18); literary pop songwriter Dylan Hicks assembled an all-star cast in his stylish, jazz-infused new ensemble Small Screens, including guitarist Zacc Harris and cellist Michelle Kinney with (9 p.m. Icehouse, $12-$17); DJ Jake Rudh's Transmission dance team offers the \"Pump Up the Jams\" retro party (9:30 p.m. Uptown VFW, $12-$17); Vets Fest 2023 features Pat McLaughlin Band (1 p.m. Roseville VFW, free, donations accepted);\n\nSunday, July 9\n\nGinger Commodore, one of Minneapolis' most versatile voices, salutes the one and only Tina Turner (7 p.m. the Dakota; $20-$35); Chris Lynch's eclectic chamber-folk ensemble Dust of Suns, featuring Semisonic's John Munson, dusts off its third album, \"Ignes Fatui,\" a collection of waltzes, tangos and other elegant instrumental pieces that suit the release-party pairing with the French film \"Am\u00e9lie\" (6 p.m. Parkway Theater, $20-$27); Aimee Lee, one of the Twin Cities finest vocalists, presents her tribute to the underrated Carpenters (4:30 & 7:30 p.m. Belvedere tent at Crooners, $40-$50); young, eclectic indie-rock sextet Oister Boy celebrates the release of its debut album, \"Wycliff St.,\" with echoes of the Walkmen and Broken Social Scene (8 p.m. 7th St. Entry, $13); the Diaspora! show promises Latinx hip-hop \"sounds from way down\" with Desdamona, Kouzen, DJ Sir Maro and Just Yoni (7 p.m., Icehouse, $8)\n\nMonday, July 10\n\nAmid a busy schedule of summer outdoor gigs, North Country folk/blues acoustic hero Charlie Parr settles in for a two-night stand with air-conditioning, fine dining and refined acoustics (7 p.m., also Tue., the Dakota, $30-$40).\n\nTuesday, July 11\n\n6. Blondshell: A fast-rising act you're likely to see next door in the Mainroom within a year's time, New York-raised, Los Angeles-based indie-rocker Sabrina Teitelbaum, 26, is garnering critical praise and lots of Current radio play locally for her eponymous debut album as Blondshell. The seering single \"Salad\" fantasizes about poisonous revenge on a sexual abuser, and other songs cover substance abuse, bisexuality and Judaism in blunt and powerful ways, sounding equal parts Bully and Belly. Brooklyn trio Hello Mary opens. (9 p.m. 7th St. Entry, 701 1st Av. N., Mpls., $14-$17, axs.com)\n\n7. Cantus: To close its season, the eight-man vocal group will perform a program of art song in Yiddish, English and Hebrew, centered around a song cycle by American composer Alex Weiser called \"And All the Days Were Purple.\" There will also be a Maurice Ravel \"Kaddish\" and even a dash of Mel Brooks. (7:30 p.m. MacPhail Center for Music, 501 Second St. S., Mpls.; 7:30 p.m. Wed. American Swedish Institute, 2600 Park Av., Mpls.; 11 a.m. July 13 and 7:30 p.m. July 14, Westminster Hall, Nicollet Mall and Alice Rainville Place, Mpls., $5-$36, cantussings.org.)\n\nAlso: A Hold Steady-sounding, Nashville-based troupe made up of several indie-rock vets, the Country Westerns have been earning high praise with their second album, \"Forgive the City\" (8 p.m. Icehouse, $12-$17).\n\nWednesday, July 12\n\n8. Melanie Martinez: A decade after she was a runner-up for Team Adam on \"The Voice,\" this New York singer has regained a buzz as a Billie Eilish-style alt-pop artist. Her new singles \"Void\" and \"Death\" are racking up big viral numbers via music videos featuring a rather eerie animated alter-ego named Cry Baby. Both are from her third album \"Portals,\" which she largely self-wrote and self-produced and has led to this ambitious summer headlining tour. (7:30 p.m. the Armory, 500 S. 6th St., Mpls., all ages, resale tickets only, ticketmaster.com)\n\n9. Billy Bob Thornton & the Boxmasters: The Oscar-winning actor and sometimes singer-songwriter is heard on Gov't Mule's new song \"The River Only Flows One Way\" but Thornton's role is more spoken word than singing on this swampy, spooky, sometimes jazzy tune. The 7-minute piece definitely has a vibe; the same could be said of Thornton's own music heard on a series of albums he released in the '00s. However, he formed the Boxmasters in 2007 with J.D. Andrew and their 2023 and 15th album, \"'69,\" sounds like it was inspired by the Traveling Wilburys, the Turtles and the pop-rock of 1969. (7 p.m. the Dakota, 1010 Nicollet Mall, Mpls., $65-$75, dakotacooks.com)\n\n10. Souls of Mischief: Part of the same Oakland, Calif.-based Hieroglyphics hip-hop crew that birthed Del tha Funkee Homosapien and the Pharcyde, the quartet seemed poised to be West Coast rivals to A Tribe Called Quest in the early '90s with their jazzy and funky organic beats and free-flowing, tag-team lyricism. The best example of this remains their debut album, \"'93 'Til Infinity,\" the 30th anniversary of which has finally brought them back out on the road. Fellow Bay Area vet the Architect opens along with New York DJ BreakBeat Lou and local wordsmith Sean Anonymous. (9 p.m. Fine Line, 318 1st Av.

The lack of a nighttime cooldown can rob people without access to air conditioning of the break their bodies need to function properly.\n\nWith Tuesday\u2019s low of 94 F (34.4 C), the city has had nine straight days of temperatures that didn\u2019t go below 90 F (32.2 C) at night, breaking another record there, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Salerno, who called it \u201cpretty miserable when you don\u2019t have any recovery overnight.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the city also set a record for the hottest overnight low temperature: 95 F (35 C).

Around one-third of Americans are under some type of heat advisory, with the most blistering temperatures in the South and West, where even the regular simmer has turned up a notch. (AP Photo/Matt York)\n\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 This summer's punishing heat wave has baked much of the U.S. in sweat-soaked misery. Records are falling as temperatures soar, and millions of people are left clamoring for relief.\n\nThe country's preeminent desert city has long sweltered through such brutal heat. And there are lessons to be learned from people who live in a city so hot it's named after the mythical bird that was born from flames.\n\nHere are some of the ways residents in metropolitan Phoenix have learned to adapt to unruly heat.\n\nAIR CONDITIONING \u2013 A HOT COMMODITY\n\nPhoenix backyards are a symphony of humming and whirring beginning in the spring as monster A/C units rattle to life.\n\nAir conditioning is so vital in the desert that cities such as Phoenix, Tempe and Scottsdale have adopted cooling ordinances, which require landlords to keep temperatures in rental homes below a certain threshold.\n\nUnits usually are installed on rooftops with the help of cranes.\n\n\u201cMy air conditioner right now is running almost all the time,\" said longtime Scottsdale resident Naomi Evelan. \"And I\u2019m worried because when I have it set on 80, for example, it actually doesn\u2019t get beyond 82 ... It\u2019s working really hard.\u201d\n\nBURNING HOT\n\nIf the sidewalk is hot enough to fry an egg, it\u2019s certainly hot enough to burn human feet. Last year, the Arizona Burn Center recorded 85 admissions from heat-related burns in the summer months.\n\nSomeone can faint from the heat or suffer any other medical emergency and burn themselves on hot asphalt, according to Dr. Geoff Comp, an attending emergency medicine physician.\n\nThe damage, including blistering and skin sloughing off, can happen within minutes, Comp says.\n\nHow do people avoid the ER? By wearing protective layers of clothing and understanding their own limits outside.\n\nFoam handles protect vulnerable hands from hot metal knobs on exterior doors. Pet owners outfit their furry friends in booties to keep their paws from getting singed.\n\nGETTING SHADY\n\nArizona sizzles through more than 300 sunny days annually. Beyond slathering on sunscreen, desert dwellers have other ways to keep the UV at bay.\n\nSome install shade screens on their windows at home \u2014 solar shades block ultraviolet light and are a booming business around Phoenix.\n\nCar windows are tinted, shade structures tower over grocery store parking spaces, and it\u2019s rare to see a playground without a sunshade stretching over it.\n\nThere's also natural shade, better known as trees. Electric utility Salt River Project offers its customers free shade trees for their property if they sit through a Zoom course.\n\nMesquites, palo verdes and the desert willow are among the species that offer quick-growing, sun-thwarting canopies.\n\nPhoenix and Tempe have tree and shade master plans with designs to cover a quarter of their cities in shade.\n\nSome diehard sun avoiders will wear gloves while driving, with the added benefit of protection from a potentially scalding steering wheel.\n\nEARLY BIRDS\n\nOne of the best ways to avoid the sun is to get up before it rises. Dog parks fill before dawn with panting pets. Runners pound the pavement as cyclists sweep by on the trails in the early morning hours. Golf balls clank off clubs before most people's alarms buzz them awake.\n\n\u201cWe rearrange our schedule,\" said Heather Moos, who has lived in the area for 22 summers, and was heading home from the dog park before 7 a.m. Tuesday. \"We\u2019re up before the sun comes up. Basically we get to the dog park about 5:00 in the morning.\u201d\n\nOn the other side of things, some desert hot spots stay open in the dark. The Desert Botanical Garden hosts flashlight nights, when guests can wander the gardens under the stars. Nighthawks soar overhead while scorpions fluoresce under ultraviolet lights.\n\nThe Boyce Thompson Arboretum has similar events that also feature Arizona's nocturnal critters.\n\n\u201cI guess we have to be vampires in this kind of weather,\u201d Moos said.\n\nFINDING AN OASIS\n\nPools are as much a part of the Phoenix landscape as the saguaro cactus. But in scalding temps, they can turn to bathwater.\n\nCompanies can install cooling systems to chill the waters, but there are simpler methods. Aerators spray water above the pool to keep them cool.\n\nMisters that spritz water to cool diners are a common sight outside restaurants as well.\n\nLongtime resident Sandy Fam wears a wet towel around her neck to keep cool.\n\n\u201cI've been doing that for years,\u201d she said.\n\nBut while Fam lives in relative comfort, she worries about those who don't.\n\n\u201dYou know, I feel for people who struggle with\u201d paying for air conditioning. They're the ones really suffering, she said.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1091, "llama_token_count": 1357}, {"source_name": "The Conversation Africa", "author": "Nick Haslam, Professor of Psychology, The University of Melbourne", "title": "Chemical adventurers: the science of the mind has a long, colourful history of psychedelic exploration", "description": "Freud doing cocaine.

But the ingenuity required to discover that the residue of a boiled toad is hallucinogenic and the bravery required to drink the fetid broth reveal the powerful human appetite for mind expansion.\n\nToad juice (or bufotenine, its active ingredient) is currently experiencing a renaissance, albeit usually in smokable form.

Consumption can be fatal, as tragic deaths in Australia from a different frog toxin have shown.\n\nReview: Psychonauts: Drugs and the Making of the Modern Mind \u2013 Mike Jay (Yale University Press)\n\nPsychedelics are back in the news. Around the world, research on their therapeutic uses is accelerating and popular interest and consumption are growing. Psilocybin and MDMA (ecstasy) have recently been approved in Australia as adjuncts to therapy for treatment-resistant depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The swiftness of the decision has surprised many advocates of psychedelic treatment.\n\nHypervision Creative/Shutterstock\n\nThis development has triggered a predictable combination of hype and dread. Some see a coming therapeutic revolution that could break through the stubbornly high rate of non-response to standard mental health treatments. Others see a dangerous fad that runs well ahead of the scientific evidence, and is riddled with zealots, dodgy operators and regulatory challenges.\n\nMike Jay\u2019s superb Psychonauts: Drugs and the Making of the Modern Mind investigates how we got to this point and why our ambivalent fascination with mind-altering substances endures.\n\nBy his account, psychonauts are explorers of inner space who seek new forms of consciousness, mystical experiences, unknown pleasures, or, sometimes, commercial opportunities. Just as astronauts ride rockets to the stars, psychonauts experiment with their brains to enter unexplored psychic territory: per aspera ad anima.\n\nRead more: Do psychedelics really work to treat depression and PTSD? Here's what the evidence says\n\nThe early psychonauts\n\nIn a popular but myopic view of Western history, non-medicinal drug-taking is a relatively recent phenomenon that reached its zenith in the 1960s counterculture. Caffeine, nicotine and alcohol are overlooked. Jay excavates a much deeper and more interesting history of early chemical adventurers.\n\nIn the 1880s, for example, Sigmund Freud self-administered cocaine to test whether it could induce euphoria and recharge the cerebral battery as earlier psychonauts had suggested. One had reported visions of \u201ca golden tortoise seated on a throne of soap\u201d.\n\nWikimedia Commons\n\nPersuaded by his positive experiences, Freud wrote influential papers, endorsed cocaine manufacturers, and recommended their product to a colleague as a treatment for opiate dependency. Freud was not alone in underestimating how addictive the substance could be. Chastened by his colleague\u2019s descent into a vortex of abuse, he set cocaine aside and airbrushed it from his life story.\n\nThe tale of nitrous oxide is less cautionary. Jay recounts how the psychologist William James felt transformed both personally and professionally by his experiments with the gas, inhaled from green silk bags rather than the cream-whipping bulbs of today.\n\nTo James, nitrous oxide revealed the complexities of consciousness by dissolving familiar categories and providing access to mystical experiences behind the veil of ordinary awareness. This perspective resonated with the literary modernism of the day and informed his famous writings on religious experiences.\n\nCannabis presents Jay with another extended historical case study, this time dominated by literary and artistic pioneers. In mid-19th century France, consumption of hashish became associated with sensuality and a bohemian fascination with the Arab world. A similar exoticism persisted when hashish was introduced to the United States, where it became a common ingredient in elixirs and was promoted as a source of spiritual epiphanies by \u201csex magician\u201d Paschal Beverly Randolph.\n\nRead more: Friday essay: peyotes in suburbia \u2013 the secret world of Sydney's psychoactive cacti growers\n\nSubstances and society\n\nMuch of Jay\u2019s book lays out an absorbing history of psychoactive substances, but it is also rich with insights on the broader societal implications of substance use.\n\nJay recounts how the meaning of \u201cdrug\u201d has been altered and contested over the past century. Once an expansive category, it contracted when \u201cmedications\u201d escaped into therapeutic legitimacy, leaving the remaining substances stigmatised and criminalised.\n\nMore recently, psychedelics have attempted the same manoeuvre, trying to shed the taint of abused drugs to become seen as morally impeccable. The claim that they are consumed for the higher purposes of self-exploration or therapy, rather than the grubby ones of addiction or hedonism, has underpinned that attempt.\n\nJay pointedly argues that this distinction has been overlaid by a racial hierarchy. Psychedelics have been stereotypically whiter than the substances against which the American war on drugs has primarily been fought, disproportionately targeting minority communities as a result.\n\nThe varied explanatory frames placed around substance use are equally intriguing. In 1884, the physician Norman Kerr asked whether \u201cinebriety is a sin, a crime, a vice or a disease\u201d.\n\nJay demonstrates how, beginning in the early 20th century, moralising and pathologising both became more prominent. Addiction came to be seen as socially corrosive, resulting in harsh criminal penalties for possession. A widespread belief arose that drug use revealed a lack of self-restraint found in people of \u201clower\u201d classes and races.\n\nConcurrently, the study of substance use became more focused on disease and pathology. Abstinence came to be equated with health. The temperance movement and Prohibition combined these images of drug use as blameworthy and unhealthy.\n\nJay acknowledges that substance use can be health-damaging, but rejects the view that it is intrinsically pathological. He also rejects the argument that psychedelic experiences mimic psychosis. Consumers are typically aware that their altered perceptions are chemically induced, rather than experiencing a break with reality. For this reason, \u201challucinogen\u201d is a misnomer: drug experiences are not psychotic hallucinations.\n\nRead more: The real promise of LSD, MDMA and mushrooms for medical science\n\nPsychonautics and psychology\n\nAs its subtitle indicates, Psychonauts is not just a story of the pioneers of chemical self-experimentation, but an account of their influence on psychological modernity. Jay identifies some intriguing connections between the psychonauts\u2019 explorations in mind expansion and wider trends in the mind sciences.\n\nMany early psychonauts were artists, writers and philosophers, but influential psychologists and neurologists were also well represented, notably Freud, James and, decades later, Harvard psychology professor Timothy Leary, a buttoned-down academic researcher before he turned on, tuned in and dropped out.\n\nThese three writers all found inspiration in their experiences of intoxication, although Freud backed away from his own. Their explorations were supported by approaches to psychology that centred the study of subjectivity. How better for researchers to study experience than to subject themselves to it?\n\nWilliam James worked at a time when subjective experience was central to the nascent field of academic psychology. Introspection was the methodology of choice, used by Edward Titchener to identify at least 44,435 conscious elements that could be blended or combined into perceptions and ideas.\n\nPublic domain\n\nThis attempt to formulate an introspective science of consciousness was later superseded by a laboratory science of brass instruments and observable behaviour. But until that time James could carry out his investigations of nitrous oxide and mystical experiences without challenging psychology\u2019s zeitgeist.\n\nAs the pendulum swung towards behaviourism in the first half of the 20th century, psychologists\u2019 attention shifted away from awareness and towards what people \u2013 or more often rodents and pigeons \u2013 did rather than felt.\n\nThis period roughly coincides with the Progressive Era in the United States, when drug use was redefined from personal choice to social problem, resulting in greater regulation of controlled substances and punishment of those who refused to be regulated. New psychoactive substances \u2013 such as amphetamines, ecstasy and LSD \u2013 were synthesised during this period, but the tradition of self-experimentation had died within psychology.\n\nThis was all to change in the 1960s, coinciding with a humanistic backlash against behaviourism. It is no accident, Jay argues, that a new generation of psychonauts, such as Leary and his colleague Richard Alpert, rose at a time when psychologists were exploring the complexity of human needs beyond fundamental biological drives.\n\nAbraham Maslow\u2019s well-known pyramid of needs, capped by the need for self-actualisation, recognised that people aspire to peak experiences of self-transcendence when their basic physiological requirements or \u201cdeficit needs\u201d have been met. The search for ingestible nirvana became a well trodden path to that end.\n\nJay\u2019s sympathies clearly lie with the psychonauts and against the forces of repression and moralism. Although he acknowledges their naivety and pierces some of their pretensions, he sees their quest as a noble one. They were seeking genuine discovery rather than artificial paradise. Present day psychonauts can trace their lineage to a group of bold and passionate explorers.\n\nJay is not starry-eyed about the significant costs of addiction and abuse, but reminds the reader of the equally profound toll of an unwinnable war against drugs. He reminds us that psychoactive substances deliver not only illicit kicks and therapeutic benefits, but pleasures and insights. His book is a delightful history of the Romantic rebels who first sampled those blessings.", "tiktoken_token_count": 2098, "llama_token_count": 2637}, {"source_name": "AZCentral", "author": "Arizona Republic, Clara Migoya, Arizona Republic", "title": "Wildlife agency restores protection for Arizona's cactus pygmy-owl after long legal battle", "description": "The tiny raptor lost protection 17 years ago due to a lawsuit from home builders.

The decision comes after nearly 17 years of legal battles to restore protection for the bird.\n\nThis pygmy-owl, a subspecies of the more widespread ferruginous pygmy-owl, is a 6- to 7-inch tall predator that inhabits portions of the Sonoran Desert, the south of Texas, and northeast and northwest of Mexico. In Arizona, the population of pygmy-owls, which are not migratory, declined close to extinction. The state currently has the smallest population of all territories.\n\nThe tiny raptor has been under federal protection on-and-off. The federal agency said it's \"likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future.\"\n\nIn the last century, it fully disappeared from areas of Arizona and Texas that used to be part of its original territory, mainly due to urbanization. By 1997, biologists counted only 35 individual birds in Arizona.\n\nThat year the Fish and Wildlife Service declared the subspecies threatened, but homebuilders pushed back, arguing that protection in Arizona was not needed for the species to survive, given that it's also present in Texas and Mexico. The agency revoked the threatened status in 2006. Conservation groups, including the Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife, petitioned the agency to relist it and filed a lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe fierce little cactus ferruginous pygmy-owl needs our care and protection and after a long fight it finally got it,\u201d said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \"But it shouldn\u2019t have taken this long or required multiple lawsuits to get here.\"\n\nThe nonprofit filed another lawsuit last month because the agency was six months past its legal deadline to list the bird.\n\nGreenwald added that the federal agency is \"badly broken\" and needs new leadership to get back to \"efficiently protecting species and addressing the extinction crisis.\u201d\n\nImperiled species:4 pygmy-owls hatch at Phoenix Zoo as part of conservation program\n\nConservation status and land use\n\nDespite the loss of federal protection, efforts to protect the population of pygmy-owls in Arizona has continued.\n\nThe 1997 listing of the pygmy-owl \"created uncertainty about where and how (Pima County) could grow,\" said Adelita Grijalva, who chairs the Pima County Board of Supervisors.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the supervisors created the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan, a regional plan to balance development with natural and cultural resources conservation, and a Multi-Species Conservation Plan to comply with the Endangered Species Act. The county now owns more than a quarter million acres of sensitive lands.\n\nWith these plans, the listing of the pygmy-owl as threatened \"will not result in land-use battles like those of the 1990s and early 2000s,\" Grijalva added.\n\n\"The pygmy owl will merely join the list of other endangered and threatened species whose habitat the people of Pima County protect and preserve through their Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan.\u201d\n\nThe potential range of the bird includes Pima, Santa Cruz, Cochise and Yuma counties, though most of the observed nests are in the Altar Valley, northeast from Sasabe, as well as the Tohono O'odham Nation lands and Avra Valley. The Altar Valley Conservation Alliance, a collaborative organization of ranchers that works for watershed health and good land management practices, also developed a plan to contribute to the enhancement of pygmy-owl habitats.\n\nSaguaros and mesquite woodlands are the primary habitat for the tiny raptor in Arizona.\n\nIn Sonora, Mexico, the owl populations are in \"notable decline,\" although they are higher than those in Arizona, according to the USFWS analysis. In Texas, the pygmy-owl population is in the high hundreds and is \"somewhat genetically isolated from the rest,\" according to the agency. This gives this population some resiliency. Areas in northeast and northwest Mexico have an estimated \"tens of thousands of pygmy-owls.\"\n\nDefining critical habitat for the owl\n\nThe first time the species was listed, the federal wildlife agency identified 731,712 acres of land in southern Arizona as pygmy-owl critical habitat, mostly by the side of streams, mesquite thickets, woodlands and desert scrub.\n\nThe agency said its biologists will propose new designated critical habitat \"at a later date.\"\n\nThe designation is a \"legal requirement that is not supposed to be delayed but may be,\" Greenwald told The Republic.\n\nOne of the changes that come with the listing is that Fish and Wildlife Service is required to develop a recovery plan for the species. The listing also provides additional protections against development where pygmy-owls live or in areas designated as critical habitat, and freezes up federal dollars for conservation under Section 6 of the Endangered Species Acts he added.\n\nThe Arizona Game and Fish Department opposed the listing during the public comment period, and added that it also opposed \u201cany designation of critical habitat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe designation of critical habitat will add undue regulatory burden on the Department and partners current and future conservation actions and increase regulatory burden for private landowners within the designated critical habitat area,\u201d wrote the agency\u2019s Assistant Director of Wildlife Management Division Clay Crowder.\n\nClara Migoya covers environmental issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.

Early Wednesday, fire officials calculated the fire had consumed an estimated 2,500 acres.\n\nAccording to InciWeb, Diamond impacted multiple homes and forced evacuations by Scottsdale police. Scottsdale reported that nearly 100-plus homes had been evacuated, affecting at its peak about 1,145 people.\n\nOfficials with the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management said on Wednesday the fire stayed within its footprint overnight, with no additional movement or growth, but hot, dry and breezy conditions forecast for Thursday may cook up some activity in the afternoon.\n\n\"Hand crews focused on working the hot edges and securing up containment line ensuring it will hold during the afternoon winds. Operations reports the lines are holding well, with some interior flareups due to - and expected - unburned pockets of fuel. There was some smoke off of the fire today as winds picked up and increased fire activity briefly. Helicopters were utilized this afternoon to help extinguish hot spots. Large aircraft, including VLATs and LATs remain available, if needed,\" officials said on InciWeb.\n\nThe number of personnel assigned to the fire remained at 150 from multiple agencies, including one United States Forest Service Hotshot Crew, three Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management Type 2 hand crews, 10 engines and two water tenders.\n\nDiamond Fire:Evacuations ordered in Scottsdale as brush fire rages near McDowell Mountain Regional Park\n\nMaricopa County Supervisor Tom Galvin, who represents the area, spoke about the community response during a county meeting on the morning of June 28.\n\n\"This is a community that was very scared last night,\" he said. \"They were very worried. This fire moved fast.\"\n\nWhere is the Diamond Fire?\n\nThe Diamond Fire started near 130th Street and Ranch Gate Road in north Scottsdale, 11 miles southwest of the Rio Verde community.\n\nThe fire quickly began moving east toward the McDowell Mountain Regional Park, according to Scottsdale police.\n\nWhat caused the Dimond Fire?\n\nThe cause of the fire, which is still unknown, is being investigated by the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management and the Scottsdale Fire Department.\n\nWhere were evacuations?\n\nA slew of evacuation orders had gone out shortly after the blaze began, affecting residents near:\n\nWest of 152nd Street.\n\nSouth of Rio Verde Drive.\n\nEast of 136th Street.\n\nNorth of Jomax Road.\n\nAll evacuation orders were lifted the evening of June 28.\n\nOur Guide:Everything you need to know about wildfire season safety\n\nIn the parched community of Rio Verde Foothills, where many homes have been without a stable water supply for months, residents rallied to get neighbors and animals out of the fire\u2019s path as quickly as possible.Cody Reim, one of the people who helped move livestock, said the winds shifted the flames away from the community \u201cliterally at the last minute.\u201d\u201cIt was absolutely a miracle,\u201d he said.Foothills residents told The Arizona Republic on the night of June 27 that they were unaware of any injuries. But many could still see the orange glow from McDowell Mountain Regional Park as they went to bed.\n\nOne secondary structure was lost, Davila said.\n\nClosures for the Diamond Fire\n\nOn Thursday, fire officials said road, park and trail closures remained in place.\n\nEastbound traffic at 128th Street and Ranch Gate Road had been closed as crews got to work on controlling the blaze.\n\nThose in the area near Rio Verde, 144th Street, Desert Holly Drive and 130th Street were also asked to avoid the area.\n\nMcDowell Mountain Regional Park has been closed until further notice.\n\nAccording to a tweet from Scottsdale, the Scottsdale Fraesfield and Tom's Thumb trailheads and surrounding trailheads in the Gooseneck area of the Preserve were closed beginning the morning of June 28 and will remain closed through at least Sunday, July 2.\n\nAdditionally, the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management urged those flying drones above the fire to avoid the airspace, as crews piloting aircraft to mitigate the fire would be forced to the ground.\n\nShelters available for impacted residents\n\nDue to the displacement of over 1,000 residents in the area, the American Red Cross Arizona had opened an evacuation center at Cactus Shadows High School for those in need of assistance. However, the Maricopa County Department of Emergency Management announced on the afternoon of June 28 that the school would transition from a shelter to a heat relief station, open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., but did not reopen Thursday.\n\nAnimals were evacuated to the Cave Creek rodeo grounds at 37201 N. 28th St. in Cave Creek, said County Manager Jen Pokorski.\n\nRepublic reporters Sasha Hupka and Allison Feinberg contributed to this article.", "tiktoken_token_count": 1123, "llama_token_count": 1412}, {"source_name": "AZCentral", "author": "Arizona Republic, Abigail Celaya, Arizona Republic", "title": "New specialty license plate features singer Alice Cooper", "description": "Alice Cooper's new plate is one of five new arrivals launching alongside two redesigned plates.", "url": "https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2023/07/14/new-specialty-license-plate-features-singer-alice-cooper/70411885007/", "text": "A new specialty vehicle license plate was released for the summer, the Arizona Department of Transportation announced Thursday.\n\nThe license plate features American singer Alice Cooper.

Wildlife centers can offer guidance or rehabilitation.", "url": "https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-environment/2023/06/28/heat-waves-affect-birds-too-what-to-do-if-you-find-a-baby-hawk/70359148007/", "text": "Young raptors are jumping out of their nests early as the extreme heat becomes unbearable, and wildlife rescue centers are getting dozens of calls a day from people who found the chicks on the ground.\n\nScorching, three-digit temperatures take a toll on all living creatures, but some are better adapted or better prepared for it than others. Baby hawks, and other younglings, can fall or jump out of the nest when the heat becomes too intense.\n\nNests, high up in the canopy, are often too exposed to the sun, and wildlife experts suggest the number of baby raptors in need of rehabilitation is rising because heat is arriving earlier when many chicks are still in the nest and can't fly in search of water or shade.\n\nIn Phoenix, Liberty Wildlife, a volunteer-based organization, recorded an intake of over 7,000 birds last summer. The Tucson Wildlife Center, another nonprofit, took in about 200 chicks in just one weekend. On Monday, as an excessive heat warning came into effect, the rescue center in Tucson got over 20 calls just over one morning, a hotline operator said.\n\n\"Hawk-pocalypse\u201d, is how the coordinator of Shasta Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation in California described the extreme-heat season of 2021. They took in about 10 times the usual number of baby raptors when temperatures reached three digits. Some died from organ failure due to dehydration or injuries from the fall.\n\nIt's important people don't move the birds unless it's an emergency, rescue groups say. Offering it water and calling a wildlife rescue center before acting is always better.\n\nWhat bird species are affected?\n\nAll bird species suffer to some degree, but how much depends on the individual's health and life stage.\n\n\"Our desert birds are well adapted to heat, and extremely high temperatures in late June are expected,\" said Jennie MacFarland with the Tucson Audubon Society. They avoid peak temperatures by staying in the shade and within thick vegetation.\n\n\"It is individual birds that are in poor health or under some type of physical distress that are likely to perish during a heat wave.\"\n\nThere are cases where adult birds, disoriented by the heat, crash into cars, or appear on the front steps of homes, lying on the ground to cool off.\n\nIt's normal for young birds to leave the nest \"before they look ready to humans,\" said MacFarland. Adult birds can continue to feed and care for the baby outside of the nest.\n\n\"However, extreme heat can cause young birds to bail out of a nest earlier than normal to avoid fatal overheating, especially if the nest isn't sufficiently shaded,\" she added. \"When very high temperatures occur at unexpected times, this behavior can be widespread and cause alarm among urban residents.\"\n\nCooper's hawks, red-tailed hawks and screech owls account for most of the intakes in rescue centers. Their nests are higher and falls can cause serious injuries. Raptors can be more noticeable than other birds, which might nest farther from houses or hide in the shade of the brush, suggested a Tucson Wildlife Center staff member.\n\nBut the center takes into rehabilitation a wide number of species, including cactus wrens, American kestrels, quails, mockingbirds, woodpeckers and black-crowned night herons.\n\n\"We actually got some baby bats in,\" said Hubert Parker, with the Tucson Wildlife Center. \"Same thing, they jumped. They were in a place that was too hot for them. It affects all of them.\"\n\nPast heat waves:3 birds of prey released into wild after rescue from summer heat\n\nSeeing wildlife in distress also has to do with the unnatural urban environment and with our power of observation.\n\n\"We had our biggest intake year when COVID was going on, because people were home and they saw things,\" said Parker. It is a matter of awareness.\n\n\"The species we get the most reports of mortality during high temperatures are doves,\" said MacFarland. \"I'm not sure if they are actually more susceptible or more likely to be noticed by residents since they are commonly found in yards and gardens.\"\n\nExtreme heat can also affect chicks in the wild but human observers are mostly in cities. And desert cities are hotter than surrounding wildlands, she added.\n\nWhat should you do if you find a chick?\n\nIf you find a baby bird seemingly in distress, you should watch it and call a rescue center before you act.\n\nNot all chicks and young birds that are off the nest need rescuing. If the bird has no injuries, it likely just needs time to recover in the shade. Specialists can walk you through what is best to do.\n\nOften the parents are watching over them close by, and wildlife specialists discourage taking them away to a rescue center unless necessary. Rescue centers sometimes suggest a 24-hour watch period.\n\nYou should try to see from afar if the bird has injuries, and put a dish of water out.\n\nIf the staff at the rescue center identify an emergency, they can direct you on how to take the bird to them for rehabilitation.\n\n\"You can help birds and other native animals during this and future heat waves by putting out dishes of water in your yard. Put several rocks in the dish so animals like baby quail don't accidentally drown,\" MacFarland added.\n\nFind the wildlife rescue center closest to you in this resource guide from Arizona Wildlife Federation.\n\nClara Migoya covers environment issues for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.

There are not a lot of refillable \u201ctraveler style\u201d notebook or journal covers available that are not leather. But Endless has created a cover made from cactus making is a strong, durable, leather-like material that looks good and feels good in the hand and is plant-based and eco-friendly. The cactus covers are available in Beige, Black or Maroon and retail for $60. These covers come boxed in a lovely gift box that reusable with one Storyboard dot grid notebook and a matching pen loop.\n\nI find the beige color to look a bit more cool in tone than a true beige. It most reminded me of desert sage-y green and felt most appropriate for my first cactus leather journal cover. The exterior really does have the feeling of a thick leather but its cactus!!! The interior feels like suede. The edges are finished to match the cover and\n\nThe pen loop is a wide elastic strap that will attach vertically to keep the journal closed while providing an elastic slot to hold your favorite pen tool. I placed the Muji Fountain Pen in the slot and it fit just fine. I am not a fan of these vertical elastic strap however since they have to be completely removed to utilize the notebook and can then get lost, dropped, etc. I prefer looping my pen under the horizontal elastic with or without additional pen loop to secure the pen. Its just less stuff to keep track of or require table space when working.\n\nThe Storyboard Notebook included with the cover features 80gsm Regalia Paper. The paper is fountain pen friendly and is a popular alternative to many of the Japanese papers.\n\nThe journal includes three elastics but, unlike other notebooks, the extra elastics included with the Explorer Journal Cover are not sewn into the cover nor sold separately but simply looped around the cover material creating some color contrasts. The main elastic is deep green and matches the horizontal closure elastics, the extra elastics are yellow and aqua.\n\nThere is an instruction sheet included to show how to attach additional notebooks using these extra elastics but I am inclined to utilize the techniques recommended by Traveler\u2019s Company and loop the extra elastics inside the cover to keep the exterior minimal.\n\nI am so accustomed to European measurements like A5 and B6 that when I read the size for the Explorer cover (8.1\u201d x 5.7\u201d) I just assumed it was A5 (148 \u00d7 210 mm). I think it would be helpful to include the metric measurements on the packaging.\n\nThe notebook included is the Storyboard Large Notebook ( 7.5\u201d x 5.1\u201d) which, for the record, is NOT A5 \u2014 see the above photo with an A5-sized Stalogy under the cover. Nope\u2026 not gonna fit.\n\nI did grab one of my beloved Paperblanks B6-ish (125 \u00d7 176 mm or 6.9\u2033 x 4.9\u2033) notebooks which does look like it will fit though it might be a bit thick with the hardcovers. B6 cahier-style notebooks should fit fine into the Cactus Cover.\n\nI love B6-sized notebooks but they are not as prevalent.\n\nI really hoped that the Explorer Cactus Leather Cover would be A5 size which is such an industry standard for the pen community these days and definitely would provide more options for inserts and accessories. Maybe the next addition will be an A5-sized cover? Endless, please, make a larger cover! If you\u2019re looking for a non-leather option for a journal cover and would like to try a B6 size, I would definitely recommend this cover. It\u2019s so great to have non-leather options\u2026 finally!\n\nDISCLAIMER: The items included in this review were provided free of charge by Luxury Brands USA for the purpose of review.

The 6-\u00adfoot, 300\u00ad-pound fount of friendliness had come to make sure the city slickers were settling in comfortably. Pritchard was something of an invalid, but he hobbled around with his cane and pet beagle, Molly. His presence reassured Tracy. \u201cLarry\u2019s the kind of guy I would like to have for a neighbor,\u201d she said.\n\nEveryone seemed friendly, including the stranger in the blue Chevy pickup who ambled up as Rick and Tracy sat around their campfire the second night. \u201cKnock, knock,\u201d he said with what sounded like a country twang. \u201cMy name\u2019s Robert, and this is my kid, Mitchell.\u201d Tall, lean and carrying a drink, Robert Comer was slightly tipsy. \u201cYour friend\u2019s up at our place partying,\u201d he continued. \u201cCome on over.\u201d\n\nTracy and Rick declined the invitation but welcomed Comer again when he and the 8-year\u00ad-old boy returned later. \u201cMitchell and I like to cut wood,\u201d Comer explained as he dropped a night\u2019s supply beside the fire.

This is Arizona Drug Enforcement, and this is a bust!\u201d\n\nConfused, Rick and Tracy stumbled toward the bright lights. As Rick exited the tent, he was pushed face-\u00adfirst into the dirt.

And the intruders had flashed a badge of some kind.\n\nKnowing they\u2019d done no wrong, Rick and Tracy sat passively as Comer bound their wrists and ankles with industrial\u00ad-size garbage\u00ad bag ties and duct tape, then wrapped more tape around their heads, partially covering their mouths. Comer shoved Rick and Tracy into the Ford, leaving the woman behind.\n\nDown the road, Comer pulled into a dry creek bed. \u201cIt\u2019s a long way to the Phoenix lockup,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got to go to the bathroom, now\u2019s the time.\u201d\n\nAs Comer led Tracy from the truck, a new wave of panic struck her.

Then he drew a foot\u00adlong knife, slashed Tracy\u2019s long underwear, and in the glare of the headlights raped her\u2014inches from Rick.\n\nAfterward, putting his .38\u00ad-caliber pistol to Rick\u2019s head, Comer turned to Tracy and said, \u201cYou know I have to kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t do that!\u201d Tracy pleaded. \u201cHe won\u2019t do anything.\u201d Comer put away his gun, hogtied Rick, covered him with a blanket and kicked him into the brush. \u201cYou try to rescue her and I\u2019ll kill her,\u201d he promised. Then he drove off with Tracy into the starless night. It was 2:30 a.m.\n\nInto the lion\u2019s den\n\nSenseless violence had been a way of life for Comer. During a late\u00ad 1970s spree, he\u2019d raped a young girl and less than 24 hours later stabbed a stranger in the back at a fast-\u00adfood restaurant. His trip to the Burnt Corral campground had begun weeks before in Sacramento County, California, where authorities claim he murdered the owner of the Chevy pickup. Traveling east with his girlfriend, Juneva Willis, and her two small children,\u00ad Mitchell and 10-year-\u00adold Sarah,\u00ad Comer, 30, was suspected of pulling an armed robbery in Salt Lake City and breaking into cabins in Colorado to steal food and guns.\n\nClad only in a sweat suit and socks, Rick lay beneath the blanket, shaking with cold and thinking, Can this really be happening? Rick\u2019s mind turned to his Catholic up\u00adbringing: the Hail Marys came quickly, followed by the Act of Contrition and the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Our Father who art in heaven \u2026\n\nAs he prayed for a miracle, Rick squirmed uncomfortably: Comer had left him lying on top of a rock,\u00ad one with a razor\u00ad-sharp edge. Rick cut his bonds and began making his way toward what he thought was the road. Unable to see in the pitch blackness, he stepped into a mass of thorns. Wait until there\u2019s light, he thought, wrapping himself in the blanket.\n\nAs the truck bounced up the steep mountain road, Tracy also prayed silently. Comer had ditched the Ford pickup and dragged Tracy into his Chevy, where Juneva Willis was waiting. Learning that Rick had been left alive, Willis asked Comer, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill him?\u201d\n\nTracy made two disturbing discoveries: Mitchell and Sarah were in the back of the truck, under a tarp. And on the floor of the cab was Molly, Larry Pritchard\u2019s dog. Only one thing could explain Molly\u2019s presence: Comer must have killed Pritchard.\n\nComer drove through the night, crossing into the rugged Mazatzal Mountains. Stopping occasionally, he warned Tracy, \u201cRemember, city girl, if you try to get away, I\u2019ll shoot you in the kneecaps and leave you for the coyotes.\u201d To emphasize his point, Comer tossed a piece of moldy bologna in front of the truck, and when Molly dashed to retrieve it, he shot and killed her.\n\nAt the top of a peak, after five hours of driving, the truck ran out of gas. Comer cut Tracy\u2019s bonds, forced her into the woods and raped her again.\n\nAs the sun rose, Rick walked back to the camp, where he met two trappers who drove him seven miles to a phone. At the campsite, officers discovered Larry Pritchard\u2019s body beneath a pile of firewood. He had been shot through the head, and his throat was cut. My God, Rick thought, Tracy is with a homicidal maniac.\n\nAssisted by military helicopters, authorities began scouring the area. Their overriding fear: Tracy would not be found alive.\n\nMorning dawns\n\nTracy wanted to make breakfast for the children. Looking at them broke her heart: dirty faces, matted hair, the girl with a large burn across her leg. But Comer ordered they were to have no breakfast.\n\nThough terrified of Comer, the children quickly warmed to Tracy. Now, they told her, she could live with them too. \u201cMother will make you moccasins like she will for us.\u201d Tracy looked down to see the children\u2019s toes sticking out of their ill-fitting shoes.\n\nEven Willis had moments of seeming friendliness. Occasionally, she would touch Tracy\u2019s arm and whisper, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d\n\nApparently believing he had intimidated Tracy into submission, Comer turned to chopping fire\u00ad wood. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go,\u201d Willis confided to Tracy, \u201cyou better go now. This is the busiest he\u2019ll ever get, and he\u2019ll never let you go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t take you with me,\u201d Tracy said softly to the children. \u201cBut if he comes, don\u2019t tell him what direction I went in.\u201d\n\nTracy glanced at the clock in the truck. It was 7:59 a.m. Then she ran, with no idea where she was going, with no shoes, only socks, crashing through snow and rocks, cactuses and thorns. She gave herself a stern order: You will not feel the pain. You will not give up.\n\nOnly minutes later, Comer returned and noticed Tracy had vanished. \u201cWhich way did she go?\u201d he shouted. Willis pointed in the di\u00adrection she had told Tracy to flee. Grabbing his rifle, Comer fired several shots into the brush.\n\nA daring escape\n\nThe Four Peaks area of the Mazatzal Mountains is characterized by steep, soaring slopes and narrow valleys. Its desert plants are covered with thorns and spines. Tracy, praying the snow would numb her feet, was propelled by the fear that Comer was right behind her. \u201cI\u2019m a bloodhound,\u201d he had told her. \u201cYou can\u2019t get away from me.\u201d\n\nAs she ran, Tracy discovered strengths. For 13 years she had been a figure skater, and she was in excellent physical shape. Cutting through the savage brush, she tried to calm herself by recalling the music that had accompanied her as she glided across the ice: Ravel, Mozart, Tchaikovsky.\n\nShe also developed an alter ego modeled after her demanding Catholic schoolteachers. Whenever she slowed, this new, strong voice chided her: Get going, you wimp.\n\nShe reminded herself, as well, of her \u201cthree miracles.\u201d The first was being adopted by loving parents. The second was meeting Rick. The third was in the making: I will survive this.\n\nAs Tracy ran through the snow and cactuses, she thought, I have been visited by angels before. They will not abandon me now.\n\nBefore long, Tracy\u2019s feet were totally numb. Long spines from a barrel cactus drove deep into her thighs.\n\nAt midday she came upon a waterfall that blocked her escape. Could she double back? No\u2014she might run into Comer. Edging her way out onto the slick rocks, Tracy lost her footing and dropped through the torrent, smashing her head on a rock and knocking herself uncon\u00adscious.\n\nMercifully, the shock of the freezing water quickly revived her, and she struggled to the bank. Night brought another miracle: a sky full of stars. God is with me, she thought. He is lighting my way.\n\nHowever, the fear of Comer would not leave her, even as ex\u00adhaustion demanded she stop and rest. Has he been trailing me, she wondered, waiting until I\u2019m almost free before finally finishing me off?\n\nComer wasn\u2019t the only wild ani\u00admal that concerned her. Two coyotes ventured within yards, showing an unnerving interest in her feet. In a nearby tree, she saw a mountain lion watching her.\n\nAs the sun burst across the desert, the new day brought a brilliant sunrise and welcome sounds: an orchestra of birds and later, in the distance, the most beautiful music of all\u2014the sound of passing cars. Tracy staggered down the road, rejoicing, still running from Comer, 24 hours after her escape.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been raped and kidnapped!\u201d she told Bob McCollum, the first driver who stopped. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t feel my feet.\u201d Severely blistered, they were swollen to over twice their normal size.\n\nWord raced through the small town of Payson, Arizona, that a young woman had escaped shoeless through the mountains and was in the Lewis R. Pyle Memorial Hospital. Soon Tracy had a waiting room full of well\u00ad-wishers, bearing gifts of food and clothes.\n\nEight hours after Tracy\u2019s rescue, police discovered Comer\u2019s abandoned pickup truck. An hour later, they found Comer behind a bush. He had buried his pistol, but he brandished his rifle at the approaching officers. He finally sur\u00adrendered and was airlifted out of the mountains under heavy guard.\n\nComer was sentenced to 353 years for armed robbery, kidnap\u00adping and sexual assault, among oth\u00ader charges. He was sentenced to death for the murder of Larry Pritchard. Says Maricopa County prosecutor K. C. Scull, \u201cRobert Comer is one of the two or three cruelest people I have ever encoun\u00adtered in my 28 years of law enforce\u00adment. He is truly a monster.\u201d Juneva Willis received 9 1/2 years for kidnap\u00adping; her children are being raised by relatives.\n\nTracy and Rick were married af\u00adter their ordeal, on July 14, 1990. Doctors had feared Tracy\u2019s feet might have to be amputated, but surprisingly, they healed. She still has a lump on her head from her plunge down the waterfall.\n\nThe nightmare failed to drive Tracy and Rick from the desert. Indeed, their favorite pastime re\u00admains camping in the mountains, including the Mazatzals. They now live in Apache Junction, Arizona\u201430 miles from the penitentiary where Robert Comer sits on death row.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Comer was executed in May 2007 in Arizona, a little more than 20 years after the events of this story.", "tiktoken_token_count": 2781, "llama_token_count": 3344}, {"source_name": "Lithub.com", "author": "Dan Sheehan", "title": "Read the first reviews of every Cormac McCarthy novel.", "description": "Do you like this sentence?: How surely are the dead beyond death.

The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe\n\nIf you answered \u201cyes\u201d to any of these, you probably are, or should be, a Cormac McCarthy fan. For over half a century the famously aloof novelist, playwright, and screenwriter, who died last month at the age of 89, plunged into the dark, arid subconscious of the American west and surfaced with a series of bleak and terrifying visions.\n\nTo mark what would have been McCarthy\u2019s 90th birthday, here\u2019s a look back at what the critics wrote about each of his twelve novels.\n\n*\n\nThe Orchard Keeper (1965)\n\nThey are gone now. Fled, banished in death or exile, lost, undone.\n\n\u201cWoods and fields, mountains and cabins, isolation and cranky independence, these seem good to the literary mind; and especially good if the writer in childhood had a fleeting glimpse of some last outpost of rural America. Traditional folkways and folk speech, the sounds and smells of the natural world, and the violent behavior of men not yet truly civilized are irresistibly appealing as material for fiction.\n\nSome novelists can write with brilliance and a fresh point of view about such familiar matters\u2026Others, although they are highly gifted too, are sorely handicapped by their humble and excessive admiration for William Faulkner. Cormac McCarthy, author of The Orchard Keeper, is one of these.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cIn his The Orchard Keeper he has his own story to tell; but he tells it with so many of Faulkner\u2019s literary devices and mannerisms that he half submerges his own talents beneath a flood of imitation.\n\nThere are no marathon sentences in these pages, but most of Faulkner\u2019s other famous characteristics are present: the wandering pronouns with no visible antecedents; the recondite vocabulary and coined words; the dense prose packed with elaborate figures of speech; the deliberate ambiguity, the hints and withheld information; the confusion in time and place, and the flashbacks that fall to shed much light into the intermittent gloom.\n\nAll these factors insure that The Orchard Keeper is an exasperating book. But the wonder is that in spite of them it is also an impressive book.\n\nMr. McCarthy is expert in generating an emotional climate, in suggesting instead of in stating, in creating a long succession of brief, dramatic scenes described with flashing visual impact. He may neglect the motivation of some of his characters. He may leave some doubt as to what is going on now. But he does write with torrential power.\u201d\n\n\u2013Orville Prescott, The New York Times, May 12, 1965\n\nOuter Dark (1968)\n\nI\u2019ve seen the meanness of humans till I don\u2019t know why god ain\u2019t put out the sun and gone away\n\n\u201cCormac McCarthy\u2019s second novel, The Outer Dark, combines the mythic and the actual in a perfectly executed work of the imagination. He has made the fabulous real, the ordinary mysterious. It is as if Elizabeth Madox Roberts\u2019 The Time of Man, with its earthbound folkways and inarticulate people, has been mated with one of Isak Dineson\u2019s gothic tales.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cIn the outline the story has a Faulknerian profile. In a shack in the woods, a young girl is about to give birth to a child, one she has conceived by her brother. The girl struggles through the delivery without any help except for the fumbling attention of the boy. After the baby is born, the young man exposes it to die in the woods. But a tinker who has been suspicious of what was going on in the cabin, carries the baby off. The girl learns of it an sets off in search of her incestuous son; the boy sets off in search of her. The double quest is the heart of the story.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cMr. McCarthy has, however, not merely written a gothic tale. The shadows and dark corners are not only there for atmosphere. A stubborn, impenetrable society lives in this book, one we hoped had long since disappeared. And in it are acted out the old patterns of crime, punishment and sacrifice.\u201d\n\n\u2013Thomas Lask, The New York Times, September 23, 1968\n\nChild of God (1973)\n\nAt one time in the world there were woods that no one owned\n\n\u201cCormac McCarthy is perhaps the most gifted of all the current generation of Southern novelists. He has a poet\u2019s feeling for language and the ability to conjure up effectively in a page what a lesser writer would take a chapter to do. Child of God, McCarthy\u2019s third novel, is a transitional work which attempts to go beyond The Orchard Keeper and Outer Dark.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cMcCarthy\u2019s gift is akin to that of Poe: the ability to bring up from the unconscious fears which seem to go back to the beginning of the race. Unfortunately, he seems here to believe that he is writing a naturalistic novel, that is, that poor Ballard\u2019s obsessions are the result of his heredity and his environment. The solution is reductive. In fiction, explanations of madness are always simplistic. It is true that McCarthy insists that Ballard is not mad, but it is difficult to see what else he could be.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cAnd yet Child of God is a marvel. McCarthy\u2019s writing is more compressed and beautiful that ever. Page by page, sentence by sentence, the writing is the work of a master. Many of the scenes have a kind of hallucinatory power which etch them indelibly on the mind. Ballard is an authentic revenant; the problem is that McCarthy seems to think that he is a mountain man who has been badly treated.\u201d\n\n\u2013William Parrill, The Tennessean, January 27, 1974\n\nSuttree (1979)\n\nBut there are no absolutes in human misery and things can always get worse.\n\n\u201cSuttree is a fat one, a book with rude, startling power and a flood of talk. Much of it takes place on the Tennessee River, and Cormac McCarthy gives us a sense of river life that reads like a doomed Huckleberry Finn.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cAt times Mr. McCarthy\u2019s picture of hell becomes bloated and strained with thick, gassy language, as \u2018troops of ghost cavalry clashed in an outraged sky, old spectral revenants armed with rusted tools of war colliding parallactically upon each other like figures from a mass grave shorn up and girdled and cast with dread import across the clanging night and down remoter slopes between the dark and darkness yet to come.\u2019\n\nBut the bombast disappears as quickly as it arrives, and Mr. McCarthy creates images and feelings with the force of a knuckle on the head.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cThe book comes at us like a horrifying flood. The language licks, batters, wounds\u2014a poetic, troubled rush of debris. It is personal and tough, without that boring neatness and desire for resolution that you can get in any well-made novel. Cormac McCarthy has little mercy to spare, for his characters or himself. His text is broken, beautiful and ugly in spots. Mr. McCarthy won\u2019t soothe us with a quiet song. Suttree is like a good, long scream in the ear.\u201d\n\n\u2013Jerome Charyn, The New York Times, February 18, 1979\n\nBlood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West (1985)\n\nWar is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god.\n\n\u201cBlood Meridian comes at the reader like a slap in the face, an affront that asks us to endure a vision of the Old West full of charred human skulls, blood-soaked scalps, a tree hung with the bodies of dead infants. But while Cormac McCarthy\u2019s fifth novel is hard to get through, it is harder to ignore. Any page of his work reveals his originality, a passionate voice given equally to ugliness and lyricism.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cThis latest book is his most important, for it puts in perspective the Faulknerian language and unprovoked violence running through the previous works, which were often viewed as exercises in style or studies of evil. Blood Meridian makes it clear that all along Mr. McCarthy has asked us to witness evil not in order to understand it but to affirm its inexplicable reality; his elaborate language invents a world hinged between the real and surreal, jolting us out of complacency.\u201d\n\n\u2013Caryn James, The New York Times, April 28, 1985\n\n\u201cMcCarthy aspires to be the Goya of American letters \u2026 McCarthy\u2019s style is a pastiche of bad Faulkner, and his vocabulary is apparently drawn from Jacobean tragedies and translations of Beowulf\u2026This archaic diction does give the novel an epic tone, intimating that brutality is eternal and ineradicable. McCarthy could have stopped there, not without honor. But no: He tries to name the cause, and here he waffles. Maybe it\u2019s war, or maybe it\u2019s lucre. Or maybe it\u2019s God: The narrative is littered with portentous phrases like \u2018Gods years\u2019 and \u2018lies by God lies.\u2019 These held-thought-out pronouncements, after a while, become irksomely hollow and pretentious \u2026 Down in Hades, John Gardner must be grinding his teeth. Blood Meridian is certainly bold and disturbing\u2014but does that make it a masterpiece?\u201d\n\n\u2013Allen Boyer, The Detroit Free Press, March 24, 1985\n\n\u201cThe first time I read Blood Meridian, I was so appalled that while I was held, I gave up after about 60 pages. I don\u2019t think I was feeling very well then anyway; my health was going through a bad time, and it was more than I could take. But it intrigued me, because there was no question about the quality of the writing, which is stunning. So I went back a second time, and I got, I don\u2019t remember\u2026 140, 150 pages, and then, I think it was the Judge who got me. He was beginning to give me nightmares just as he gives the kid nightmares. And then the third time, it went off like a shot. I went straight through it and was exhilarated. I said, \u2018My God! This reminds me of Thomas Pynchon at his best, or Nathanael West.\u2019 It was the greatest single book since Faulkner\u2019s As I Lay Dying \u2026 to have written even one book so authentically strong and allusive, and capable of the perpetual reverberation that Blood Meridian possesses more than justifies him. I don\u2019t think McCarthy will ever match it, but still\u2026 He has attained genius with that book \u2026 More than successful. It\u2019s not only the ultimate Western, the book is the ultimate dark dramatization of violence.\u201d\n\n\u2013Harold Bloom, The AV Club, June 15, 2009\n\nAll the Pretty Horses (1992)\n\nI can normally tell how intelligent a man is by how stupid he thinks I am.\n\n\u201cCormac McCarthy\u2019s formidable prose is indebted to the Old Testament. His landscapes are wide, blazing and biblical with conflagrations. His characters are not thick, psychologically resonant creations, but are subordinate to the breadth and muscle of the world that surrounds them. In the Old Testament, of course, the surrounding world belongs to God. But in McCarthy\u2019s novels, it is nature\u2014nasty, brutish and short.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cIn his sixth and best novel, All the Pretty Horses, McCarthy attempts some things he hasn\u2019t attempted before, and mostly he succeeds \u2026 Cole runs away with a friend, Lacey Rawlins, searching for a land where he can ride his horse uninterrupted by fences, and where property is constantly improved through hard, honest labour rather than parcelled off in lots. What Cole discovers, however, is the same muddy, awful horrors which usually destroy McCarthy\u2019s characters \u2013 bad love, dishonest cops, bloody conflicts, and people made dangerous by their disillusionment. Unlike the characters in Faulkner (the writer to whom McCarthy is most often compared), McCarthy\u2019s people endure rather than prevail; yet in Horses John Grady Cole approaches more heroic stature.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cFor the most part, All the Pretty Horses reads like the sort of classic western revisionism that can be found in films like Eastwood\u2019s Unforgiven or Peckinpah\u2019s The Wild Bunch. McCarthy succeeds best as a writer about men and male friendships, and neither the love story at the centre of this book, nor the female character, Alejandra, ever really come off. But the prose, as always in McCarthy\u2019s work, is stunning, and the story far more absorbing than that in any of his previous books. As a result, All the Pretty Horses is the best place to start for anyone interested in exploring McCarthy\u2019s weird and violent fictional landscapes. It possesses both intelligence and integrity, and while the world it describes may not always seem real, it always feels realized.\u201d\n\n\u2013Scott Bradfield, The Independent, April 16, 1993\n\nThe Crossing (1994)\n\nDeep in each man is the knowledge that something knows of his existence.\n\nSomething knows, and cannot be fled nor hid from\n\n\u201cThe Crossing is a miracle in prose, an American original. It deserves to sit on the same shelf certainly with Beloved and As I Lay Dying, Pudd\u2019nhead Wilson and The Confidence-Man, and if it will put readers in mind of Faulkner, Twain, Melville and Shakespeare, it will also put them in mind of Ernest Hemingway, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Miguel de Cervantes, Samuel Beckett, Joseph Conrad and, for good measure, John Ford, Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone. But The Crossing is a tale so riveting\u2014it immerses the reader so entirely in its violent and stunningly beautiful, inconsolable landscapes\u2014that there is hardly time to reflect on its many literary and cinematic echoes or on the fact that Mr. McCarthy is a writer who can plunder almost any source and make it his own.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cThis first section of the book reads, indeed, like a cross between Faulkner\u2019s novella The Bear and Don Quixote. It is about the length of a novella, and it is written with such force and momentum\u2014the reader is so ransacked emotionally by the end of it\u2014that it seems, one-third of the way into the book, that Mr. McCarthy can have nowhere to go.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cMr. McCarthy, because he is interested in the mythic shape of lives, has always been interested in the young and the old or, if not the old, then those who have already performed some act so deep in their natures (often horrific, though not always) that it forecloses the idea of possibility. \u2018Doomed enterprises,\u2019 Mr. McCarthy\u2019s narrator remarks, \u2018divide lives forever into the then and the now.\u2019 So The Crossing is full of encounters between the young boys, who look so much like the pure arc of possibility, and the old they meet on the road, all of whom seem impelled, as if innocence were one of the vacuums that nature abhors, to tell them their stories, or prophesy, or give them advice.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u201cIt is Mr. McCarthy\u2019s gift that he can signal his literary intentions to his readers without archness. If he seems post-modern in his sense that everything is a quotation of a quotation, he parts company with post-modern practice in thinking, not that everything therefore refers to nothing, but that in human life certain ancient stories are acted out again and again. A writer\u2019s moral relation to these stories is like nothing so much as a craftsman\u2019s relation to his tools, and nothingness is not to be counted for the pleasure of merely circulating, but built against, sentence by sentence\u2014and here certain Faulknerian adjectives might come into play\u2014if hopelessly, in the knowledge of the doom of all human intention, then indefatigably, in the knowledge of the skills of a trade that has been passed down to one and that will be passed in turn to other hands.\u201d\n\n\u2013Robert Hass, The New York Times, June 12, 1994\n\nCities of the Plain (1998)\n\nOur waking life\u2019s desire to shape the world to our convenience invites all manner of paradox and difficulty.\n\n\u201cLike its brilliant predecessors, All the Pretty Horses and The Crossing, Cities of the Plain tells a riveting story that is simple in form but presses outward toward the archetypal and the infinite.\n\n\u2026\n\nAs the title\u2019s reference to Sodom and Gomorrah suggests, Cities of the Plain is about the end of things. But the end of what? John Grady Cole has an extraordinary innocence and openness of heart (something quite different from stupidity or naivete) that does not seem to belong in the dailiness of the modern world. But Cities of the Plain is also about the end of an American way of life. Gathered around Parham and Cole at the ranch is a collection of drifters and aging cowboys, each with a history and a story to tell. The book is filled with moving depictions of the routines of cowboy life, adventures high in the hills above the cities spreading out across the plain. McCarthy has a special ear for the horse- and landscape-bound language of cowboys, a way of speaking that has all but disappeared, and he seems intent on salvaging that language and all it represents.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s view of the world is austere. As in the previous novels, his characters encounter brutality, as well as the sublime. If he offers any real hope, it lies in the redemptive power of language. McCarthy is perhaps the finest American prose stylist writing today. As poet Robert Hass has written, \u2018McCarthy seems incapable of writing a boring sentence.\u2019 Cities of the Plain contains passages of rare and hypnotic beauty. It completes a series that will surely become an American literary classic.\u201d\n\n\u2013Alden Mudge, BookPage, June, 1998\n\nNo Country For Old Men (2005)\n\nHow does a man decide in what order to abandon his life?\n\nThe body count in No Country for Old Men is high, but the renderings of death are muted, truncated, abrupt. We do not find the gore heightened as it is in Blood Meridian \u2026 Aside from Sheriff Bell, who is more a conscience than a character, none of these figures can rightfully be called the protagonist, which is probably McCarthy\u2019s intention. Without a universal moral code, humanity is reduced to a nebulous relativism that can make a right of any wrong, a wrong of any right and can justify any action with ease \u2026 Redemption, honor, dignity, hope: McCarthy portrays these notions as the foolish nostalgia of an old and dying generation. What the future holds for us in his vision is brute violence, the rule of shameless force, a world in which power, not conscience, is the only commodity of value.\n\n\u2013Eric Miles Williamson, The Los Angeles Times, July 24, 2005\n\n\u201cTo read Cormac McCarthy is to enter a climate of frustration: a good day is so mysteriously followed by a bad one. McCarthy is a colossally gifted writer, certainly one of the greatest observers of landscape. He is also one of the great hams of American prose, who delights in producing a histrionic rhetoric that brilliantly ventriloquizes the King James Bible, Shakespearean and Jacobean tragedy, Melville, Conrad, and Faulkner \u2026 Curiously, McCarthy\u2019s new novel has almost none of the battered ormolu that makes his earlier prose so distinctive\u2026McCarthy is continent here, which is in keeping with the spirit of the novel. Everything is tight, reduced, simple, and very violent \u2026 The book gestures not toward any recognizable reality but merely toward the narrative codes already established by pulp thrillers and action films. The story is itself cinematically familiar \u2026 The problem with a novel like No Country for Old Men is that it cannot give violence any depth, context, or even reality. The artificial theatre of the writing makes the violence routine and showy. And McCarthy\u2019s idea\u2014his novelistic picture\u2014of life\u2019s evil is limited, and literal: it is only ever of physical violence \u2026 His myth of eternal violence asserts, in effect, that rebellion is pointless because this is how it will always be. Instead of suffering, there is represented violence; instead of struggle, death; instead of lament, blood.\u201d\n\n\u2013James Wood, The New Yorker, July 25, 2005\n\n\u201cWith a title that makes a statement about Texas itself, McCarthy offers up a vision of awful power and waning glory, like a tale told by a hermit emerging from the desert, a biblical Western from a cactus-pricked Ancient Mariner \u2026 Through squinted eyes this novel can be seen as a morality tale nestled within a fast-paced and compelling crime saga. The narrative seethes with a rhetorical thrust that likens to Dickens\u2019 anger at the poverty of England in Bleak House, only here McCarthy rails against the drug trade that is ruining the Texas-Mexico borderland \u2026 Like these doomed cowboys, McCarthy cannot turn away from the horror he sees around him. His voice is hoarse, his visions are often nightmares. In No Country for Old Men he has conjured up a heated story that brands the reader\u2019s mind as if seared by a knife heated upon campfire flames.\u201d\n\n\u2013William J. Cobb, The Houston Chronicle, July 17, 2005\n\nThe Road (2006)\n\nKeep a little fire burning; however small, however hidden.\n\n\u201cThe paradox in every part and sentence of the post-apocalyptic narrative\u2014evoking even as it denies\u2014is repeated as if fractally by The Road as a whole \u2026 All the elements of a science fiction novel of the post-apocalypse are present or at least hinted at\u2026There are bits of satire of a very dark order in the hints that religious extremism caused the holocaust, and in the relentless way McCarthy deprives the foolish reader of the reassurances \u2026 The Road is neither parable nor science fiction, however, and fundamentally it marks not a departure but a return to McCarthy\u2019s most brilliant genre work, combined in a manner we have not seen since Blood Meridian: adventure and Gothic horror.\u201d\n\n\u2013Michael Chabon, The New York Review of Books, February 15, 2007\n\n\u201cThis is an exquisitely bleak incantation\u2014pure poetic brimstone. Mr. McCarthy has summoned his fiercest visions to invoke the devastation. He gives voice to the unspeakable in a terse cautionary tale that is too potent to be numbing, despite the stupefying ravages it describes. Mr. McCarthy brings an almost biblical fury as he bears witness to sights man was never meant to see \u2026 His use of language is as exultant as his imaginings are hellish, a hint that The Road will ultimately be more radiant than it is punishing. Somehow Mr. McCarthy is able to hold firm to his pessimism while allowing the reader to see beyond it. This is art that both frightens and inspires.\u201d\n\n\u2013Janet Maslin, The New York Times, September 25, 2006\n\n\u201cThe Road is a frightening, profound tale that drags us into places we don\u2019t want to go, forces us to think about questions we don\u2019t want to ask. Readers who sneer at McCarthy\u2019s mythic and biblical grandiosity will cringe at the ambition of The Road. At first I kept trying to scoff at it, too, but I was just whistling past the graveyard. Ultimately, my cynicism was overwhelmed by the visceral power of McCarthy\u2019s prose and the simple beauty of this hero\u2019s love for his son \u2026 The book\u2019s climax\u2014an immaculate conception of Pilgrim\u2019s Progress and Mad Max\u2014is a startling shift for McCarthy, but a tender answer to a desperate prayer.\u201d\n\n\u2013Ron Charles, The Washington Post, October 1, 2006\n\nThe Passenger (2022)\n\nGrief is the stuff of life. A life without grief is no life at all.\n\n\u201cMcCarthy in afflatus mode is magnificent, vatic, wasteful, hammy \u2026 McCarthy\u2019s deflatus mode is a rival rhetoric of mute exhaustion, as if all words, hungover from the intoxication, can hold on only to habit and familiar things \u2026 For the first time in his career, McCarthy is aiming to write fiction about \u2018ideas\u2019 \u2026 In the new pair of novels\u2026a fresh space is made to enable the exchange of ideas, and the rhetorical consequences are felt in the very textures of the fiction \u2026 His ear for dialogue has always been impeccable \u2026 People think and speak rationally, mundanely, intelligently, crazily, as they do in real life; only for a writer as strange as McCarthy would this innovation deserve attention. And along with the excellent dialogue there are scores of lovely noticings, often of the natural world \u2026 The new and welcome thing in The Passenger and Stella Maris is the lucidity of this bitter metaphysics. McCarthy\u2019s earlier books were so shrouded in obscurity, rang with so much hieratic shrieking and waving, that it was perfectly possible to extract five contradictory theological ideas at once from their fiery depths.\u201d\n\n\u2013James Wood (The New Yorker)\n\n\u201cMuch of The Passengerhappens in a room, or a couple of rooms, where the same scene, with variations, runs on a loop. I suspect that many readers will resist or resent spending as much time there as we do. I came to find the goings-on sometimes captivating, but almost feel that I am covering for my abuser in confessing that \u2026 I\u2019m not sure why Alicia\u2019s therapy transcripts have been made a separate volume, in Stella Maris. That is, I\u2019m not sure why McCarthy felt that The Passenger could absorb her hallucinations but not her treatment. Seems arbitrary, as formal choices go \u2026 The Passenger is far from McCarthy\u2019s finest work, but that\u2019s because he has had the nerve to push himself into new places, at the age of all-but-90. He has tried something in these novels that he\u2019d never done before.\u201d\n\n\u2013John Jeremiah Sullivan (The New York Times Book Review)\n\nStella Maris (2022)\n\nThe world has created no living thing that it does not intend to destroy.\n\n\u201cCormac McCarthy, who is pushing 90, has arrived with a pair of audacious linked novels, one a total banger and the other no embarrassment. If this is what it sounds like to be on your last legs, young writers should ask their server for whatever he\u2019s having. If McCarthy\u2019s voice is any indication, he\u2019s still limber enough to outrun an aggrieved cheetah in his drawers and stocking feet \u2026 Novels aren\u2019t made, generally, to be filled entirely by talk. But that\u2019s what Stella Maris is \u2014 transcriptions of therapy sessions with one of the hospital\u2019s shrinks. This is a Tom Stoppardesque bull session. Does it work? Uh-huh. Does it work more fully if you\u2019ve already read The Passenger? Absolutely \u2026 Stella Maris is, by comparison, a small and frequently elegiac novel. It\u2019s best read while you are still buzzing from the previous book. Its themes are dark ones, and yet it brings you home.\u201d\n\n\u2013Dwight Garner (The New York Times)\n\n\u201cIf you read the books in order, you might find Stella Maris\u2026coldly underwhelming despite, or perhaps because of, the erudition of the twenty-one-year-old, debatably schizophrenic, suicidal math genius Alice Western \u2026 McCarthy is not interested in the psychology of character. He probably never has been. He\u2019s interested in the horror of every living creature\u2019s situation. Brilliant, beautiful Alice is barely believable as a female human being. And why should she be? \u2026 Alice is the sturdy vessel for McCarthy\u2019s thinking. Perhaps too sturdy a vessel; one might prefer a bit of spillage, some froth, some fun.\u201d\n\n\u2013Joy Williams (Harper\u2019s)", "tiktoken_token_count": 5923, "llama_token_count": 7156}, {"source_name": "Hiconsumption.com", "author": "Cameron Cardwell", "title": "The Best SPF Moisturizers for Preserving Your Skin", "description": "<table><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Keep your skin smooth and protect it from harmful sun rays. </td></tr></table>", "url": "https://hiconsumption.com/style/best-spf-moisturizers-for-men/", "text": "It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re the toughest man on the planet who\u2019s wrestled bears with your bare hands, nobody is tougher than the sun. After all, the sun is 10,000\u00b0 Fahrenheit and 330,000 times as massive as our home planet. Therefore, it would be in your best interest to invest in a high-quality SPF moisturizer.\n\nMen tend to overlook skincare, but it\u2019s important to your overall health. We\u2019re not saying that you should moisturize to the point where your skin is buttery soft but enough to keep it nourished. It\u2019s also a good idea to have a go-to SPF moisturizer if you spend plenty of time in the great outdoors under the blazing sun. We get it, though. You don\u2019t know where to start or what to look for when searching for lotion. To assist you, we\u2019ve scanned the web thoroughly to find the best SPF moisturizers for men.\n\nWhy should you use SPF moisturizer?\n\nYes, it helps with keeping your skin fresh and healthy while protecting you from the smoldering sun, but let\u2019s get into the details. SPF moisturizers are a basic line of defense against the ball of fire in the sky. It prevents dryness, wrinkles, and spots, ensuring optimal skincare. And it shields your skin from UV rays, making it a key tool for preventing aging in your skin. Melanoma is no joke, and it\u2019s rising in men over the last 10 years, so getting an SPF moisturizer is a smart move, no matter how you look at it.\n\nWhat to look for\n\nSPF: You need at least 30 SPF because it blocks 97% of the sun\u2019s UVB rays, and you want as much protection as you can get. 50 SPF kicks it up to 98%, which is nice, but the difference isn\u2019t that major. Also, every pick on our guide has at least an SPF of 30, so don\u2019t sweat it.\n\nProtection: Keep in mind that SPF only blocks UVB rays, which is why broad spectrum protection is best, as it protects from both UVA and UVB rays (UVAs contribute to aging and UVBs to burning). And to help out even more, we\u2019ve only included picks with broad spectrum protection.\n\nSkin Type: If you struggle with oily skin, then a matte moisturizer without any added oil is ideal. For dry skin, you\u2019re in luck, as most moisturizers will contain ingredients that hydrate your skin (we\u2019ll touch on those below).\n\nReef Safe: This means the product does not contain oxybenzone and octinoxate, chemicals that can cause coral bleaching.\n\nKey ingredients\n\nHyaluronic acid: This is a naturally occurring substance that increases moisture in the skin and softens lines.\n\nNiacinamide: A natural anti-inflammatory that also improves hydration and locks it in.\n\nCeramides: Ceramides repair the skin\u2019s natural barrier while \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 also adding moisture.\n\nEvery Man Jack SPF 30 Mineral Face Lotion\n\nPros Broad spectrum\n\nMade in the USA with recycled materials\n\nContains ceramides\n\nNo harsh chemicals Cons Not as many hydrating ingredients compared to other picks\n\nThe Best Mineral Moisturizer: This budget pick from Every Man Jack may be cheap, but it\u2019s definitely not made cheaply. It\u2019s made with natural ingredients like shea butter and squalane, which moisturize your skin, along with panthenol, a B vitamin that reduces inflammation. Since this uses mineral SPF protection, it reflects UV rays instead of absorbing them, meaning that you\u2019re essentially applying a barrier between your skin and the sun, so keep that in mind.\n\nSPF: 30\n\nActive Ingredients: Shea butter, squalane, panthenol, and ceramides\n\nReef Safe?: Yes\n\nSize: 2 oz\n\nCeraVe AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30\n\nPros Broad spectrum\n\nNon-greasy\n\nMade with ceramides\n\nOil-free Cons Strong sunscreen smell\n\nThe Starter Pick: Even if you\u2019re new to the skincare game, you probably have a bottle of some CeraVe around somewhere, and that\u2019s a good thing, as the label has been a dermatologist and customer-approved even before getting acquired by L\u2019Oreal in 2017. The AM Facial Moisturizing Lotion is another unanimously-approved product from the label that\u2019s made with hyaluronic acid and zinc oxide, and features broad spectrum SPF 30. It also contains three ceramides that help repair the skin\u2019s natural barrier, and niacinamide for reducing inflammation.\n\nSPF: 30\n\nActive Ingredients: Hyaluronic acid, octinoxate, zinc oxide, niacinamide, and ceramides\n\nReef Safe?: No\n\nSize: 3 oz\n\nCardon Daily SPF + Moisturizer\n\nPros Broad spectrum\n\nLightweight and doesn\u2019t leave behind residue\n\nFast-absorbing\n\nGQ-approved Cons The bottle is a little small\n\nThe Best Lightweight Moisturizer: The Korean skincare company Cardon is all about making streamlined products that get it right the first time. Just like this daily moisturizer that features an SPF of 30, and moisturizing ingredients derived from natural sources like cactus and chia seeds, which are full of antioxidants and omega-3s that protect your skin. It\u2019s also lightweight and goes on without white streaks or residue.\n\nSPF: 30\n\nActive Ingredients: Cactus extract, chia seed extract, turmeric, avobenzone, homosalate, and octyl salicylate\n\nReef Safe?: Yes\n\nSize: 1.2 oz\n\nOars + Alps SPF 37 Sunscreen and Everyday Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer\n\nPros Doesn\u2019t contain parabens, phthalates, and sulfates\n\nOil-free and cruelty-free\n\nBroad spectrum Cons Can feel a little heavy for some\n\nThe Best Vegan Moisturizer: With all of the games that brands like to play in the grooming business, with false advertisements of \u201cnatural\u201d ingredients, it\u2019s nice to have ones like Oars + Alps, which are honest about making truly natural products. And this everyday moisturizer is another great addition from the brand, made with hyaluronic acid and Alpine Caribou Moss (a natural antioxidant). It\u2019s also vegan, cruelty-free, and reef safe, so you\u2019re helping yourself and the environment.\n\nSPF: 37\n\nActive Ingredients: Hyaluronic acid, Alpine Caribou Moss, and vitamin E\n\nReef Safe?: Yes\n\nSize: 2 oz\n\nSupergoop! Unseen Sunscreen\n\nPros Water and sweat resistant\n\nBroad spectrum\n\nGreat for all skin types\n\nLightweight and scentless Cons A little expensive for the amount given\n\nThe Best No-Show Sunscreen: Sunscreen was pretty underappreciated until everyone realized it\u2019s one of the only surefire ways to prevent signs of aging. Even still, some people still can\u2019t stand the smell and texture that it leaves behind, which is why Supergoop! makes clean and easy-to-wear products that will make anyone a believer. Like this Unseen Sunscreen that has an SPF of 40 without the smell, weight, and feel of comparable sunscreens. It\u2019s made with red algae and frankincense to moisturize and soothe your skin, and the oil-free formula means this is a good option for those with sensitive skin too.\n\nSPF: 40\n\nActive Ingredients: Avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate, and octocrylene\n\nReef Safe?: Yes\n\nSizes: .68 oz, 1 oz, and 1.7 oz\n\nAnthony Day Cream SPF 30\n\nPros Non-greasy\n\nBroad spectrum protection\n\nAbsorbs quickly\n\nMade in the USA Cons Can be heavy for some\n\nThe Best American-Made Moisturizer: The fast-absorbing Anthony Day Cream works for all skin types. The lightweight SPF 30 moisturizer contains glycerin to leave your skin feeling smooth, as well as soy and vitamin E to keep it in tip-top shape. Protect yourself from the damaging effects of UVA/UVB rays with this paraben-free lotion.\n\nSPF: 30\n\nActive Ingredients: Vitamin E, panthenol, and lactic acid\n\nReef Safe?: No\n\nSize: 3 oz\n\nDermalogica Protection 50 Sport SPF50\n\nPros Broad spectrum\n\nWater-resistant and lightweight\n\nNon-greasy finish\n\nVegan and cruelty-free Cons A little thicker than other options\n\nThe Best Summer Moisturizer: It\u2019s summertime, and that means having a day at the pool or out on the trails. So if you\u2019re in the market for a water-resistant sunscreen lotion that can accompany you on those adventures, then this offering from Dermalogica, a brand started by a skin therapist, is worth a look. It\u2019s lightweight, water-resistant, and blends into your skin for lasting sun protection and moisturization.\n\nSPF: 50\n\nActive Ingredients: Avobenzone, octisilate, homosalate, and octocrylene\n\nReef Safe?: Yes\n\nSize: 5.3 oz\n\nLab Series Day Rescue Defense Lotion\n\nPros Non-greasy and absorbs quickly\n\nGood for all skin types\n\nAmerican-made Cons N/A\n\nThe Best Hydrating Moisturizer: The SPF 35 lightweight Lab Series Day Rescue Defense moisturizer gives you ample protection against the sun, pollution, and climate that can lead to damaged and dry skin.

It comes right before Scripture outlines the days of creation.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a closer look at how the Bible\u2019s opening chapter describes what happened during creation week.\n\nDay 1: Light (Gen 1:3\u20135)\n\nGod spoke light into being on the first day. (We\u2019ll leave for other articles discussion of whether the Hebrew word for \u201cday\u201d in this chapter denotes a literal 24-hour day or a potentially lengthier \u201cage.\u201d)\n\nWhat a day it was! Illumination for the first time ever. And as anyone who has ever experienced a glorious morning sunrise over the ocean or a mountain peak can understand, God \u201csaw that the light was good\u201d (v. 4).\n\nIt sure was. In Haydn\u2019s choral masterpiece, the Oratorio, we hear that time described in musical form: \u201cThe first of days appears. Now chaos ends.\u201d\n\nIn other words, whew! So much for the disorder before creation.\n\nDay 2: Atmosphere (Gen 1:6\u20138)\n\nBy day two it appears that God is defining the boundaries between wet and dry.\n\nBesides tidying up creation, this new breathing space would support living things still to come\u2014winged, four-footed, or otherwise.\n\nSo God had a lofty plan. In a word, let\u2019s call it \u201csky\u201d (v. 8).\n\nDay 3: Land, seas, plants (Gen 1:9\u201313)\n\nWith a breathable atmosphere in place, much would happen on the third day\u2014starting with the separation of elements between land and sea. As on day two, it seems this step served as creational housekeeping, and clearly not as an end in itself.\n\nThe stage was set for even greater things to come.\n\nThen we see a botanical explosion, from simple mosses to colorful rhododendrons, hardy cactus to giant redwoods. Palm trees and Joshua trees and Monstera deliciosa. And everything in between.\n\nLook at all that green! Did God have fun with the plant world? What else could explain Venus fly traps or black bat flowers?\n\nEach created, growing thing added its own beauty, uniqueness, or usefulness to the ecosystems. Fruits and grains would serve as nutritious food for animals and\u2014wait, are we getting ahead of ourselves?\n\nAt this stage God sounded quite pleased with the progress. Because once again he called it \u201cgood.\u201d The first time he used that expression, though, was on day one. And we encounter \u201cit was good\u201d no less than six times in this chapter.\n\nNot to mention one \u201cvery good,\u201d but that\u2019s saved for the end of the week, when God sits back to review the entire package.\n\nDay 4: Lights in the sky (Gen 1:14\u201319)\n\nHere\u2019s where the wonders of astronomy came in, starting with the creation of a \u201cgreater light\u201d (the sun) and a \u201clesser light\u201d (the moon, reflecting the sun\u2019s light), followed by uncounted stars and endless galaxies.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about the Milky Way, nebulae, constellations, black holes, dwarf planets\u2014the list goes on.\n\nGod on day four created quite a showcase. He put into place an awe-inspiring witness, too, as vast as (or perhaps more vast than) the microscopic world is tiny.\n\nBecause every pulsar, every supernova reveals God\u2019s fingerprints. The prophet called us to \u201cLift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name; by the greatness of his might and because he is strong in power, not one is missing\u201d (Isa 40:26).\n\nThe psalmist also reminded us how \u201cThe heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork\u201d (Ps 19:1).\n\nDay 5: Sea creatures and birds (Gen 1:20\u201323)\n\nAnyone who has ever been snorkeling in tropical waters or birdwatching in the woods can guess why an entire day was devoted to creating natural wonders in water and sky. The marvelous intricacy of creatures with gills or feathers leaves us shaking our heads in wonder and giving praise to their maker.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of the fact that one artist created every aquatic critter I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d said Dr. Gordon Wilson, \u201cand when I think about the fact that the creator cares for all of his creatures, every minute of every day, I am overwhelmed with gratitude.\u201d\n\nAnd just like the stars and planets, the creation Professor Wilson mentions also serves as an unmistakable witness to the world. Because \u201chis invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made\u201d (Rom 1:20).\n\nDay 6: Land creatures\u2014and humans! (Gen 1:24\u201331)\n\nAt last the day arrived when God created land animals, from the tiniest field mouse to the three-toed sloth to a four-ton African elephant.\n\nAlong with the creation of animals came\u2014finally\u2014humanity!\n\nHere was something way different. Unlike plants and animals (dazzling and diverse as they were), men and women would be created \u201cin the image of God\u201d (v. 27).\n\nThere\u2019s a deep subject buried in that phrase. Books have been written about the distinction. (You\u2019ll see a couple at the bottom of this article.)\n\nAnd, of course, dig into the Word yourself\u2014look up \u201cimago dei\u201d in the (free) Logos Bible app\u2019s Factbook tool to see how the scriptures explain human nature in the image of God.\n\nClick to study imago dei online.\n\nAs theologian Mark Ross put it, \u201cThis likeness is so very special that it sets them (humans) apart from all the other creatures God made.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s the image of God that makes all the difference in how we can relate to the Creator.\n\nDay 7: Taking a break (Gen 2:1\u20133)\n\nGod paused from creation work on the final day of creation week. Was he tired after all that effort? Catching his breath from painting so many colors on tropical fish and jungle parrots?\n\nHardly! Remember that one of God\u2019s attributes is his unlimited power\u2014his omnipotence. So by \u201cresting,\u201d the scriptures simply mean that God ceased from creating. And the seventh-day rest was God setting an example for his creation, a pattern for the natural world.\n\nKeep in mind how we\u2019re told in the Exodus account, \u201cRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy\u201d (Exod 20:8, 11).\n\nThe seven-day model\n\nThere\u2019s a built-in reality behind the seven days of our creation story. As the Faithlife Study Bible explains, \u201cThe creation week serves as the model for the six-day week and Sabbath rest note in Exodus 20:11 and other Israelite laws.\u201d\n\nBut more than once, political rulers have ignored the biblical pattern and attempted to introduce weeks of a different duration.\n\nAfter their 1789 revolution, French authorities tried 10-day weeks. They thought it might help distance the new revolutionary society from the old \u201creligious\u201d ways.\n\nPerhaps similarly, Soviets in the USSR tried five- and six-day weeks in the 1920s and 30s.\n\nBoth attempts were abandoned after only a few years. And there\u2019s a reason why they didn\u2019t work. Could it be that we\u2019re simply hard-wired for a seven-day week\u2014a pattern established in the beginning?\n\nDigging deeper\n\nThere\u2019s much more to explore about the week of creation and what it means to our understanding of and relationship to God.

It comes right before Scripture outlines the days of creation.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a closer look at how the Bible\u2019s opening chapter describes what happened during creation week.\n\nDay 1: Light (Gen 1:3\u20135)\n\nGod spoke light into being on the first day. (We\u2019ll leave for other articles discussion of whether the Hebrew word for \u201cday\u201d in this chapter denotes a literal 24-hour day or a potentially lengthier \u201cage.\u201d)\n\nWhat a day it was! Illumination for the first time ever. And as anyone who has ever experienced a glorious morning sunrise over the ocean or a mountain peak can understand, God \u201csaw that the light was good\u201d (v. 4).\n\nIt sure was. In Haydn\u2019s choral masterpiece, the Oratorio, we hear that time described in musical form: \u201cThe first of days appears. Now chaos ends.\u201d\n\nIn other words, whew! So much for the disorder before creation.\n\nDay 2: Atmosphere (Gen 1:6\u20138)\n\nBy day two it appears that God is defining the boundaries between wet and dry.\n\nBesides tidying up creation, this new breathing space would support living things still to come\u2014winged, four-footed, or otherwise.\n\nSo God had a lofty plan. In a word, let\u2019s call it \u201csky\u201d (v. 8).\n\nDay 3: Land, seas, plants (Gen 1:9\u201313)\n\nWith a breathable atmosphere in place, much would happen on the third day\u2014starting with the separation of elements between land and sea. As on day two, it seems this step served as creational housekeeping, and clearly not as an end in itself.\n\nThe stage was set for even greater things to come.\n\nThen we see a botanical explosion, from simple mosses to colorful rhododendrons, hardy cactus to giant redwoods. Palm trees and Joshua trees and Monstera deliciosa. And everything in between.\n\nLook at all that green! Did God have fun with the plant world? What else could explain Venus fly traps or black bat flowers?\n\nEach created, growing thing added its own beauty, uniqueness, or usefulness to the ecosystems. Fruits and grains would serve as nutritious food for animals and\u2014wait, are we getting ahead of ourselves?\n\nAt this stage God sounded quite pleased with the progress. Because once again he called it \u201cgood.\u201d The first time he used that expression, though, was on day one. And we encounter \u201cit was good\u201d no less than six times in this chapter.\n\nNot to mention one \u201cvery good,\u201d but that\u2019s saved for the end of the week, when God sits back to review the entire package.\n\nDay 4: Lights in the sky (Gen 1:14\u201319)\n\nHere\u2019s where the wonders of astronomy came in, starting with the creation of a \u201cgreater light\u201d (the sun) and a \u201clesser light\u201d (the moon, reflecting the sun\u2019s light), followed by uncounted stars and endless galaxies.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about the Milky Way, nebulae, constellations, black holes, dwarf planets\u2014the list goes on.\n\nGod on day four created quite a showcase. He put into place an awe-inspiring witness, too, as vast as (or perhaps more vast than) the microscopic world is tiny.\n\nBecause every pulsar, every supernova reveals God\u2019s fingerprints. The prophet called us to \u201cLift up your eyes on high and see: who created these? He who brings out their host by number, calling them all by name; by the greatness of his might and because he is strong in power, not one is missing\u201d (Isa 40:26).\n\nThe psalmist also reminded us how \u201cThe heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork\u201d (Ps 19:1).\n\nDay 5: Sea creatures and birds (Gen 1:20\u201323)\n\nAnyone who has ever been snorkeling in tropical waters or birdwatching in the woods can guess why an entire day was devoted to creating natural wonders in water and sky. The marvelous intricacy of creatures with gills or feathers leaves us shaking our heads in wonder and giving praise to their maker.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of the fact that one artist created every aquatic critter I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d said Dr. Gordon Wilson, \u201cand when I think about the fact that the creator cares for all of his creatures, every minute of every day, I am overwhelmed with gratitude.\u201d\n\nAnd just like the stars and planets, the creation Professor Wilson mentions also serves as an unmistakable witness to the world. Because \u201chis invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made\u201d (Rom 1:20).\n\nDay 6: Land creatures\u2014and humans! (Gen 1:24\u201331)\n\nAt last the day arrived when God created land animals, from the tiniest field mouse to the three-toed sloth to a four-ton African elephant.\n\nAlong with the creation of animals came\u2014finally\u2014humanity!\n\nHere was something way different. Unlike plants and animals (dazzling and diverse as they were), men and women would be created \u201cin the image of God\u201d (v. 27).\n\nThere\u2019s a deep subject buried in that phrase. Books have been written about the distinction. (You\u2019ll see a couple at the bottom of this article.)\n\nAnd, of course, dig into the Word yourself\u2014look up \u201cimago dei\u201d in the (free) Logos Bible app\u2019s Factbook tool to see how the scriptures explain human nature in the image of God.\n\nClick to study imago dei online.\n\nAs theologian Mark Ross put it, \u201cThis likeness is so very special that it sets them (humans) apart from all the other creatures God made.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s the image of God that makes all the difference in how we can relate to the Creator.\n\nDay 7: Taking a break (Gen 2:1\u20133)\n\nGod paused from creation work on the final day of creation week. Was he tired after all that effort? Catching his breath from painting so many colors on tropical fish and jungle parrots?\n\nHardly! Remember that one of God\u2019s attributes is his unlimited power\u2014his omnipotence. So by \u201cresting,\u201d the scriptures simply mean that God ceased from creating. And the seventh-day rest was God setting an example for his creation, a pattern for the natural world.\n\nKeep in mind how we\u2019re told in the Exodus account, \u201cRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy\u201d (Exod 20:8, 11).\n\nThe seven-day model\n\nThere\u2019s a built-in reality behind the seven days of our creation story. As the Faithlife Study Bible explains, \u201cThe creation week serves as the model for the six-day week and Sabbath rest note in Exodus 20:11 and other Israelite laws.\u201d\n\nBut more than once, political rulers have ignored the biblical pattern and attempted to introduce weeks of a different duration.\n\nAfter their 1789 revolution, French authorities tried 10-day weeks. They thought it might help distance the new revolutionary society from the old \u201creligious\u201d ways.\n\nPerhaps similarly, Soviets in the USSR tried five- and six-day weeks in the 1920s and 30s.\n\nBoth attempts were abandoned after only a few years. And there\u2019s a reason why they didn\u2019t work. Could it be that we\u2019re simply hard-wired for a seven-day week\u2014a pattern established in the beginning?\n\nDigging deeper\n\nThere\u2019s much more to explore about the week of creation and what it means to our understanding of and relationship to God. Here are several more sources to explore.\n\nPerspectives on Creation: Five Views on Its Meaning and Significance.

But the Clase Azul brand extends far beyond the bottle. For its 25th anniversary in 2022, Clase Azul Spirits transformed into Clase Azul Mexico, a brand dedicated to exploring and encompassing multiple facets of Mexican cuisine and culture. Now, as part of the ongoing anniversary celebration, they\u2019re launching their most ambitious project yet. Clase Azul La Terraza Los Cabos is part of the new Clase Azul Destinations hospitality division. Located in San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo, by the cliffs and beaches of the Baja peninsula, it will enable visitors to experience a wide spectrum of Mexican gastronomy as curated by one of the most famous and acclaimed Mexican-owned companies.\n\nClase Azul\n\n\u201cA Taste of Culture\u201d Is a Feast for the Senses\n\nAt the center of the La Terraza experience is A Taste of Culture, a multisensory theatrical journey through the flavors, culture, and history of Mexico. A Taste of Culture connects agave spirits with other indigenous culinary touchstones through food and spirits pairings featuring five iconic Clase Azul tequilas and mezcals. It\u2019s an opportunity to learn the history and traditions behind Clase Azul\u2019s spirits\u2014and, of course, an opportunity to taste some delicious tequila and mezcal in a unique setting. Each seating is limited to eight people, guaranteeing an intimate shared experience.\n\nClase Azul\n\nDining Options Root International Styles in Mexican Flavors and Traditions\n\nLa Terraza includes a number of other venues, all of which take a different approach to Mexican food and drink, but have a common thread running through them, namely the vision of the in-house creative chef, Ivan Arias. Arias is a native of Jalisco, the home of Clase Azul. The menu at The Restaurant at Clase Azul La Terraza emphasizes the cuisine of the Baja Peninsula, classic dishes like ceviche and tacos to more elaborate fare, like blue shrimp in a banana mol\u00e9 sauce. All ingredients are sourced regionally from a network of local producers, helping to promote both sustainability and fair trade.\n\nOmakase is, of course, the Japanese culinary tradition of letting the chef design an entire multicourse meal. Omakase at Clase Azul La Terraza Los Cabos gives it a native spin, with Chef Arias preparing a 14-course meal in the presence of six lucky diners. The meal fuses gastronomic styles of many cultures, including that of Asia, through the filter of ingredients and flavors unique to Mexico. As befits such an elaborate feast, there\u2019s only one seating a night.\n\nWhere to Drink Clase Azul and Where to Buy It to Take Home\n\nA Clase Azul destination wouldn\u2019t be complete without a place to drink its tequilas and mezcals, and Clase Azul El Bar is that place. While Clase Azul is traditionally sipped neat, El Bar\u2019s beverage strategist, Sheila Zenteno, one of the most talked-about young bartenders in Mexico, uses it in a series of cocktails that utilize traditional Mexican ingredients. El Cactus, for instance, mixes Clase Azul\u2019s Mezcal Guerrero with nopal cactus cordial and garnishes it with a nopal gummy, while the Mangate employs Clase Azul Tequila Plata along with mango, basil, and egg white. All Clase Azul tequilas and mezcals are also offered neat with selected accompaniments, along with a wide selection of Mexican wines, beers, and non-alcoholic drinks and snacks.\n\nClase Azul\n\nFor visitors who want to take Clase Azul\u2019s legendary agave spirits (and equally iconic bottles) home with them, the newly refurbished Boutique at Clase Azul La Terraza, located at The Shoppes at Palmilla, offers the classic portfolio as well as limited editions not found anywhere else. Last-minute shopping before the return home is also available at the new Clase Azul Boutique in the international departures area at the Los Cabos International Airport. What ties the disparate strands of Clase Azul La Terraza together is the desire of the brand, founded and still led by Arturo Lomeli, to promote native Mexican craftsmanship and the artisanal community to the rest of the world.

The move affects a variety of Apple products from iPhones, iPads, and laptops, and builds off of similar restrictions already put in place by the digital development ministry and state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec. Kremlin officials also advised staff working on Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2024 presidential re-election campaign against using a variety of US-developed smartphones over similar espionage conveners earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple did not immediately respond to our request for comment.\n\nThe latest ban will reportedly focus mainly on emailed correspondences related to work activities, which means officials could continue employing the devices for personal use. Those officials and staff, according to the Times, may wind up double-fisting multiple phones during daily routines simply to abide by the new rules. Others, looking to avoid the hassle altogether, could switch to a suite of inferior government-approved devices running on the Russian-made Aurora operating system.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cThe FSB has long been concerned about the use of iPhones for professional contacts, but the presidential administration and other officials opposed [restrictions] simply because they liked iPhones,\u201d Russian security and intelligence services expert Andrey Soldatov told the Financial Times.\n\nRussian intelligence officials last month accused the US National Security Agency of hacking into thousands of Russian-owned iPhones and targeting the phones of foreign diplomats based in Russia. Apple, FSB officials allege, provides US intelligence agencies with a \u201cwide range of opportunities to monitor any persons of interest.\u201d To be clear, Russian officials still haven\u2019t provided any clear evidence proving the alleged US conspiracy.

Apple suspended all product sales to the country last year following its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, but intrepid buyers have found ways to import the devices from other countries. Still, Russian officials do have longer-term plans to lessen their dependence on foreign devices in the future.

In 2019, antimicrobial resistance was directly responsible for an estimated 1.27 million deaths worldwide and linked to an estimated 4.95 million total, according to an analysis published last year in the Lancet.\n\nBut the chaos and tragedies of war can exacerbate and accelerate the crisis by creating ideal conditions for antimicrobial resistance to mount an incursion. War causes severe and complex types of wounds, which are often contaminated with environmental bacteria, dust, soil, and metals from explosives. Toxic metals can help spur bacteria to develop, select for, and share genetic determinants of drug resistance. And the dirty wounds create an eclectic milieu of different types of microbes for wider drug-resistance sharing.\n\nThe injured, meanwhile, often encounter broken and extremely strained health care systems, where proper infection control measures are impossible, and laboratory testing to inform treatment for bacterial infections is unavailable. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are often handed out readily to keep people alive as they're evacuated, which sometimes involves moving through a chain of health care facilities before reaching safety. Heavy-handed use of broad-spectrum drugs is known to spur drug resistance. And, hopping from one chaotic health care facility to the next provides opportunities for fragile patients to pick up and spread multi-drug resistant infections from bacteria that lurk in health care settings\u2014aka nosocomial infections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncreased risk\n\nIn 2021, Ukrainian researchers published a study characterizing the drug resistance of bacteria plaguing military hospitals in the country, finding rates of resistance much higher than in civilian hospitals in the country and Europe. For instance, among isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, a common cause of nosocomial infections, 68 percent were resistant to carbapenem antibiotics, a class of antibiotics often used as a last-line defense.\n\nThe threat of those lurking superbugs is realized in the case report of the Ukrainian soldier, a man in his mid-50s. He was injured in a vehicle fire and sustained third-degree burns on 60 percent of his body. He was initially treated in a facility near Dnipro, Ukraine, before being moved to Kyiv and then to a US military hospital in Germany.\n\nIn Germany, health care providers screened his blood, urine, respiratory, and peri-rectal samples for infections. They turned up six distinct, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) infections: A. baumannii, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and three distinct types of P. aeruginosa. Each one was resistant to many types of antibiotics. The K. pneumoniae, another common nosocomial infection, was resistant to every type of antibiotic tested. It carried 24 antimicrobial resistance genes. It also toted genetic markers of hypervirulence.\n\nThe A. baumannii isolate carried 18 antimicrobial resistance genes, though it appeared still susceptible to at least four antibiotics. The three P. aeruginosa isolates were all distinct strains, but all were resistant to 20 of 23 antibiotics tested. And the E. faecium isolate carried eight antimicrobial resistance genes and was resistant to vancomycin, another last-line antibiotic.\n\nThe authors of the case report, led by Patrick Mc Gann, a microbiologist and deputy director of the Multidrug-Resistant Organism Repository and Surveillance Network at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland, again stressed the threat of drug-resistant bacteria spreading out of Ukraine: \"Healthcare practitioners treating citizens of Ukraine need to be cognizant of the increased risk for [multi-drug resistant] organism transmission and infection imposed by the conflict in Ukraine and implement appropriate infection control measures to mitigate their spread.\"", "tiktoken_token_count": 889, "llama_token_count": 1147}, {"source_name": "Google News", "author": null, "title": "Pentagon defends sending Ukraine cluster munitions - Reuters", "description": "Pentagon defends sending Ukraine cluster munitions\u00a0\u00a0Reuters", "url": "https://consent.google.com/ml?continue=https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3ZpZGVvL3dhdGNoL2lkT1Y1NTAxMDgwNzIwMjNSUDHSAQA?oc%3D5&gl=FR&hl=en-US&cm=2&pc=n&src=1", "text": "US News\n\nPentagon defends sending Ukraine cluster munitions\n\nPosted\n\nThe Pentagon on Friday (July 7) defended the decision by the United States to send Ukraine widely-banned cluster munitions as part of a security assistance package, a move Kyiv has said would have an \"extraordinary psycho-emotional impact\" on occupying Russian forces.", "tiktoken_token_count": 70, "llama_token_count": 87}, {"source_name": "Google News", "author": null, "title": "EU leaders back security commitments for Ukraine - Reuters.com", "description": "EU leaders back security commitments for Ukraine\u00a0\u00a0Reuters.com", "url": "https://consent.google.com/ml?continue=https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9ldS1sZWFkZXJzLWRlYmF0ZS1ydXNzaWEtbXV0aW55LXBsZWRnZS1zdXBwb3J0LXVrcmFpbmUtMjAyMy0wNi0yOS_SAQA?oc%3D5&gl=FR&hl=en-US&cm=2&pc=n&src=1", "text": "[1/4] President of the European Council Charles Michel, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell attend the European Union leaders summit in Brussels, Belgium June 29, 2023.

It has urged Kyiv to begin bringing the measure back by the end of July.\n\nAnastasia Radina, head of the Ukrainian parliament's anti-corruption committee, said legislation was under consideration that would allow exemptions, such as for service members and officials in Russian-occupied territory.\n\nBut she said watering down the disclosure requirements too much could blunt their impact.\n\n\"If the system has loopholes, then it cannot be fully functional in terms of its deterrence component,\" Radina told Reuters. \"And that would be a problem.\"\n\nThe IMF on Thursday unlocked an $890 million tranche of its package based on Ukraine's \"strong progress\" in meeting reform commitments, but said other transparency and anti-corruption measures \"need to proceed without delay\".\n\nA draft law restoring declarations had been introduced last September.

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu warned on Thursday that Russia could resort to deploying similar weaponry if faced with their use.\n\nUkrainian officials say their deployment is justified in view of Russia's mining of vast tracts of land it has seized.\n\nUkraine has launched a counter offensive more than 500 days into the war, focusing on capturing groups of villages in the southeast and retaking areas around the eastern city of Bakhmut, seized by Russian forces in May after months of fighting.\n\n\"This will further demotivate Russian occupying forces and fundamentally change things in favour of the Ukrainian armed forces,\" Shershen told U.S.-funded Radio Liberty.\n\nThe munitions, he said, would be used strictly within the legal framework, \"only for the deoccupation of our territories.\n\n\"They will not be used on Russian territory...They will be used only in areas where Russian military forces are concentrated in order to break through enemy defences.\"\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy restated Ukraine's assurances during a NATO summit on Wednesday.\n\nCluster munitions typically release large numbers of smaller bomblets that can kill indiscriminately over a wide area. Those that fail to explode pose a danger for decades.\n\nEach side has accused the other of using cluster bombs in the conflict launched by Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\nHuman Rights Watch says both Moscow and Kyiv have used cluster munitions. Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. have not signed up to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which bans production, stockpiling, use and transfer of the weapons.\n\nThe decision to send the munitions to Ukraine has been opposed by Spain and Canada, while Britain said it was part of a convention that discourages use of the weapons. Some U.S. Democratic lawmakers also raised their concerns.\n\nUkrainian military analyst Oleskander Musiyenko said he assumed the weapons would be used in the south as that area's commander had announced their arrival.\n\n\"We can say that it is in the south where it is planned to pierce and destroy the fortifications of the enemy's defence line,\" Musiyenko told Ukrainian television. \"I think cluster munitions will expand the capabilities of our troops.\"\n\nDeputy Ukrainian Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said Ukrainian troops were making headway in the south, forcing enemy forces to redeploy. Near Bakhmut, Ukrainian troops made gains south of the city, but faced more difficulties to the north.\n\nRussian accounts of the fighting said its forces had repelled 16 Ukrainian attacks in eastern Donetsk region alone.\n\nReporting by Anna Pruchnicka and Kyiv Newsroom;

Moscow then illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backed separatist proxies in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn a rare visit to Kyiv this April, Stoltenberg said Ukraine's \"rightful place\" was in NATO but later made clear it would not be able to join while the war with Russia, whose forces now occupy more of Ukraine's east and south, rages on.\n\nAt the start of June, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his nation understood this position, but at the end of the month he repeated calls for Ukraine to receive a \"political invitation\" to NATO at the summit.\n\nUnder the MAP process followed by other former communist countries in eastern Europe, candidates have to prove they meet political, economic and military criteria and are able to contribute militarily to NATO operations.\n\nA NATO flag flutters at the Tapa military base, Estonia April 30, 2023. REUTERS/Ints Kalnins\n\nSince 1999, most countries aiming to join NATO have participated in a MAP although this procedure is not mandatory: Finland and Sweden, formerly neutral states which worked closely with NATO, were invited to join the alliance directly.\n\nIt is unclear what Ukraine's path to membership will look like as more and more countries, Britain and Germany amongst them, suggest skipping the MAP process.\n\nWith such a move, NATO could address demands by Kyiv and its allies in eastern Europe to go beyond the language of the 2008 Bucharest summit agreement without offering Ukraine an actual invitation or timetable.\n\nUkraine's military has taken major steps towards NATO standards since Russia's all-out invasion. The process is accelerating as its Soviet-built arms and ammunition gradually run out and the West trains Ukrainian troops according to NATO standards and sends more and more advanced weaponry.\n\nWHY IS UKRAINIAN MEMBERSHIP SO SENSITIVE?\n\nA mutual assistance clause lies at the heart of the alliance, which was formed in 1949 with the primary aim of countering the risk of a Soviet attack on allied territory.\n\nIt is cited as one of the main reasons why Ukraine cannot join NATO while in conflict with Russia, as this might immediately draw the alliance into an active war.\n\nThe clause, Article 5 of NATO's Washington Treaty, states that an attack on one ally is considered an attack on all allies.\n\nStoltenberg has made clear that, while NATO must discuss options for giving Ukraine security assurances for the time after the war, security guarantees under Article 5 will only be provided to full members of the alliance.\n\nThe Kremlin portrays the expansion as evidence of Western hostility to Russia - something Western powers deny, saying the alliance is wholly defensive in nature.\n\nMoscow has said it would cause problems for many years to come if Ukraine joined NATO and has warned of an unspecified response to ensure its security.\n\nReporting by Sabine Siebold;

REUTERS/Scott Morgan\n\nJuly 14 (Reuters) - Republican U.S. presidential contenders attending a forum of Christian conservatives in Iowa that typically focuses on social issues found themselves on Friday having to explain their support for Ukraine in its war with Russia to a skeptical crowd.\n\nThe forum in Des Moines, sponsored by the Family Leader, an influential Iowa evangelical group, is a traditional stop on the Republican presidential campaign trail for candidates seeking to burnish their conservative credentials in Iowa. The state will hold the first contest in the race to determine the party's nominee to face Democratic President Joe Biden in 2024.\n\nSome of the hardest questions the candidates faced were not on popular conservative social issues such as opposition to abortion and transgender rights but rather on foreign policy.\n\nPushed by moderator Tucker Carlson, the ousted former Fox News host, to justify their stances, former Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina both argued that it remains vital for the United States to push back against Russian aggression. The United States has provided billions of dollars worth of weapons to Ukraine following Russia's February 2022 invasion.\n\n\"Let me tell you, if Vladimir Putin overruns Ukraine, I have no doubt that the Russian military is going to cross the border of a NATO country that our armed forces will have to defend,\" said Pence, referring to Russia's president.\n\nPence appeared visibly frustrated by Carlson's assertions that the United States lacked a national interest in the Ukraine war.\n\nScott also defended assisting Ukraine, arguing that \"everything that we do that degrades the Russian military is good for America.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the Republican race, skipped the forum and will hold his own town hall-style event next week. But Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a distant second in the polls, appeared.\n\nDeSantis earlier this year suggested that the war was simply a \"territorial dispute\" before backtracking and labeling Putin a \"war criminal.\" On Friday, DeSantis sought to make the case that Biden's administration had not done enough to define America's interests at stake in Ukraine.\n\n\"They are doing a blank-check policy without telling us when we have achieved our objective,\" DeSantis said.\n\nThe ultimate goal for the United States, DeSantis added, should be \"a sustainable peace in Europe,\" but he was not specific about how achieve that.\n\nBy contrast, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, another candidate, called for an immediate end to the war and for Russia to keep its territorial gains.\n\nMost in the crowd seemed to side with Carlson's view that the United States should force an immediate truce in Ukraine - and most remained quiet when Pence and Scott disagreed.\n\nTrump also has been sharply critical of U.S. support of the war, charging in a statement on Friday that Biden had engaged in \"reckless escalation\" in Ukraine by calling up 3,000 reservists from the U.S. military. Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nRepublican candidates who have pledged to back Ukraine - including Pence, Scott and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who also spoke on Friday - have failed to gain much traction in opinion polls.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll last month showed that a slight majority of Republicans - 56% - backed U.S. shipments of weapons to Ukraine, compared to 65% of Americans overall.\n\nCarlson also pushed Pence on his role in certifying the 2020 election results in the U.S. Congress even as Trump and his allies made false claims that the election had been stolen through widespread voting fraud. On the day of the certification vote, Trump supporters attacked the Capitol after he told them to \"fight like hell\" to \"stop the steal.\"\n\nPence defended his actions and criticized Trump.\n\n\"President Trump's words that day were reckless,\" Pence said. \"I believe history will hold him accountable.\" No applause was heard.\n\nIowa's nominating contest is set for Jan. 15. Candidates receiving strong evangelical support have won the state's caucuses contest in recent years.\n\nReporting by James Oliphant Editing by Ross Colvin and Will Dunham\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "tiktoken_token_count": 883, "llama_token_count": 1104}, {"source_name": "Google News", "author": null, "title": "Russia, Ukraine accuse each other of plotting imminent attack on ... - Reuters.com", "description": "Russia, Ukraine accuse each other of plotting imminent attack on ...\u00a0\u00a0Reuters.com", "url": "https://consent.google.com/ml?continue=https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2V1cm9wZS9ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZS1hY2N1c2UtZWFjaC1vdGhlci1wbG90dGluZy1pbW1pbmVudC1hdHRhY2stbnVjbGVhci1zdGF0aW9uLTIwMjMtMDctMDQv0gEA?oc%3D5&gl=FR&hl=en-US&cm=2&pc=n&src=1", "text": "July 4 (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday accused each other of plotting to stage an attack on the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, long the subject of mutual recriminations and suspicions.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he told his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, about Russian \"dangerous provocations\" at the plant in southeastern Ukraine.\n\nRussian troops seized the station, Europe's largest nuclear facility with six reactors, in the days following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nEach side has since regularly accused the other of shelling around the plant and risking a major nuclear mishap.\n\nRenat Karchaa, an adviser to the head of Rosenergoatom, which operates Russia's nuclear network, said Ukraine planned to drop ammunition laced with nuclear waste transported from another of the country's five nuclear stations on the plant.\n\n\"Under cover of darkness overnight on 5th July, the Ukrainian military will try to attack the Zaporizhzhia station using long-range precision equipment and kamikaze attack drones,\" Russian news agencies quoted Karchaa as telling Russian television.

The IFC was working on risk-sharing products and also sought to provide working capital to smaller businesses via Ukrainian banks, he said.\n\nThe lender announced on Friday that it was setting up a 20-million-euro ($22.24 million) risk-sharing facility for Ukrainian branches of OTP Bank and OTP Leasing.\n\nIt also said that along with its partner fund Horizon Capital, IFC had invested $5 million in Miratech, IT services and consulting company.\n\nReiterating the IFC's commitment to supporting Ukraine's private sector as the country plans for the post-war reconstruction, Garcia Mora said the biggest potential for private investors was in energy, transport and also agribusiness.\n\nThe government and the World Bank estimated in a joint assessment in March that the cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine had reached about $411 billion.

Moscow's decision raised concern primarily in Africa and Asia of rising food prices and hunger.\n\nThe Black Sea deal was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey in July last year to combat a global food crisis worsened by Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and its blockade of Ukrainian ports.

So if something is formalised without Russia, these risks should be taken into account.\"\n\nRussia says it could return to the grain deal, but only if its demands are met for rules to be eased for its own exports of food and fertiliser.
